0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:0,32
Hello everyone

2
0:0:0,32 --> 0:0:0,84
I'm Lao Jiang

3
0:0:0,84 --> 0:0:1,94
Today is May Fourth

4
0:0:1,94 --> 0:0:4,859
It's time once again for our annual chat

5
0:0:4,859 --> 0:0:7,679
Just now, I actually came across Bilibili

6
0:0:7,679 --> 0:0:9,59
This year's Youth Day video

7
0:0:9,59 --> 0:0:10,399
Bilibili releases one every year

8
0:0:10,399 --> 0:0:11,9
This year's theme is like this

9
0:0:11,9 --> 0:0:12,62
Let me summarize

10
0:0:12,62 --> 0:0:15,6
After watching it, it resonates with the widespread anxiety among young people.

11
0:0:15,6 --> 0:0:17,9
A pervasive sense of anxiety.

12
0:0:17,9 --> 0:0:19,469
And he mentioned a very scary term.

13
0:0:19,469 --> 0:0:21,549
A state of being erased.

14
0:0:21,549 --> 0:0:23,589
When it evolves to its extreme, it will be erased.

15
0:0:23,589 --> 0:0:25,28
This video has also given me a lot of inspiration

16
0:0:25,28 --> 0:0:28,8
Because at the beginning of the year, I actually did an episode on

17
0:0:28,8 --> 0:0:29,24
Observations in Mid-2024.

18
0:0:29,24 --> 0:0:31,23
Some of the points align with this.

19
0:0:31,23 --> 0:0:34,35
However, that video discussed it from the perspective of society and the community.

20
0:0:34,35 --> 0:0:36,15
I understand the generational dilemmas of young people.

21
0:0:36,15 --> 0:0:38,2
Today, I want to shift the perspective.

22
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:41,2
I will discuss this issue entirely from an individual psychological viewpoint.

23
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:45,5
I've always believed that humans have two internal motivational systems.

24
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:47,42
One is desire or craving.

25
0:0:47,42 --> 0:0:49,22
The other is fear.

26
0:0:49,22 --> 0:0:50,6
Based on my observations over the years,

27
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:52,75
Actually, for our society,

28
0:0:52,75 --> 0:0:55,39
Most people are actually driven by fear.

29
0:0:55,39 --> 0:0:56,87
We live and act because of it.

30
0:0:56,87 --> 0:1:0,11
There are so many things in life that are worth being afraid of, right?

31
0:1:0,11 --> 0:1:2,57
We fear disappointing our teachers and parents.

32
0:1:2,57 --> 0:1:4,7
We fear losing face.

33
0:1:4,7 --> 0:1:5,719
We fear being blamed at work.

34
0:1:5,719 --> 0:1:6,519
We fear losing our jobs.

35
0:1:6,519 --> 0:1:7,739
We fear being alone and aging without companionship.

36
0:1:7,739 --> 0:1:8,859
We fear being looked down upon.

37
0:1:8,859 --> 0:1:10,719
fear of not being able to pay the mortgage and so on

38
0:1:10,719 --> 0:1:13,1
both specific and vague ones exist

39
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:14,24
this kind of fear

40
0:1:14,24 --> 0:1:15,5
has seeped deep into one's being

41
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:16,78
it becomes a pattern

42
0:1:16,78 --> 0:1:20,44
an invisible tension that keeps people on edge

43
0:1:20,44 --> 0:1:22,22
whispering in your ear constantly

44
0:1:22,22 --> 0:1:24,56
to the point where you don’t even know what you’re afraid of anymore

45
0:1:24,56 --> 0:1:26,96
but you just seem to fear yourself

46
0:1:26,96 --> 0:1:28,8
The surroundings and the lifestyle

47
0:1:28,8 --> 0:1:29,94
You can hardly describe

48
0:1:29,94 --> 0:1:32,58
I don't have a deep understanding of this

49
0:1:32,58 --> 0:1:34,95
Because I'm not the anxious type

50
0:1:34,95 --> 0:1:37,23
But I do have a severe case of procrastination

51
0:1:37,23 --> 0:1:40,37
Often, I don't even know what I'm putting off

52
0:1:40,37 --> 0:1:43,25
You might say I often procrastinate when writing

53
0:1:43,25 --> 0:1:44,69
But I dislike writing.

54
0:1:44,69 --> 0:1:45,81
Dislike expressing yourself?

55
0:1:45,81 --> 0:1:48,35
It's not that I don't love expressing myself

56
0:1:48,35 --> 0:1:50,49
but I'm afraid I won't write well

57
0:1:50,49 --> 0:1:51,79
I'm afraid I won't be able to write anything at all

58
0:1:51,79 --> 0:1:53,78
so I keep putting it off and not doing it

59
0:1:53,78 --> 0:1:54,74
putting it off

60
0:1:54,74 --> 0:1:56,86
and thus the bad outcome never comes to light, right?

61
0:1:56,86 --> 0:1:57,92
it will never come to pass

62
0:1:57,92 --> 0:2:0,62
this fear of fear creates anxiety

63
0:2:0,62 --> 0:2:2,72
and anxiety silently drains us

64
0:2:2,72 --> 0:2:3,0
I

65
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:4,9
drain myself

66
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:6,27
lose my drive and independence

67
0:2:6,27 --> 0:2:7,45
then it's toxic

68
0:2:7,45 --> 0:2:8,65
many people are the same

69
0:2:8,65 --> 0:2:11,29
I believe a lot of people can resonate with this

70
0:2:11,29 --> 0:2:15,419
when you're in such an anxious predicament

71
0:2:15,419 --> 0:2:16,979
you're not really doing much

72
0:2:16,979 --> 0:2:17,92
but you feel exhausted

73
0:2:17,92 --> 0:2:19,36
Many people's lives are like this

74
0:2:19,36 --> 0:2:21,899
living in a vague and unfounded fear

75
0:2:21,899 --> 0:2:22,819
and worry

76
0:2:22,819 --> 0:2:23,819
constantly with a frown

77
0:2:23,819 --> 0:2:27,28
so I've always felt that being driven by desire

78
0:2:27,28 --> 0:2:28,52
might be better

79
0:2:28,52 --> 0:2:32,4
at least that's what I thought 34 years ago

80
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:34,8
being driven by desire seems healthier

81
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:37,23
you develop a desire to take action

82
0:2:37,23 --> 0:2:39,11
Then you go and satisfy that desire

83
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:40,93
And generate new desires

84
0:2:40,93 --> 0:2:42,53
Create new cravings

85
0:2:42,53 --> 0:2:44,65
Satisfying them forms a positive cycle

86
0:2:44,65 --> 0:2:46,71
This is generally a good thing

87
0:2:46,71 --> 0:2:49,2
But it's not always so simple

88
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:50,9
For example, in the show 'In the Name of the People'

89
0:2:50,9 --> 0:2:52,88
The corrupt official in the first episode, right

90
0:2:52,88 --> 0:2:56,99
His life could also be seen as driven by cravings

91
0:2:56,99 --> 0:2:58,23
Why not?

92
0:2:58,23 --> 0:2:59,42
He embezzled so much money.

93
0:2:59,42 --> 0:3:2,3
But you're talking about this rampant, uncontrolled desire.

94
0:3:2,3 --> 0:3:3,38
What did it bring him?

95
0:3:3,38 --> 0:3:4,7
Definitely not something good.

96
0:3:4,7 --> 0:3:5,86
So, overall,

97
0:3:5,86 --> 0:3:10,22
Actually, both desire and fear can create positive feedback.

98
0:3:10,22 --> 0:3:11,84
They are our biological instincts, after all.

99
0:3:11,84 --> 0:3:13,12
They are our treasures.

100
0:3:13,12 --> 0:3:14,24
One is seeking benefits

101
0:3:14,24 --> 0:3:15,1
The other is avoiding harm

102
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:16,68
When they are specific

103
0:3:16,68 --> 0:3:17,94
There's not much of an issue

104
0:3:17,94 --> 0:3:21,91
But when desires and fears become abstract

105
0:3:21,91 --> 0:3:23,19
That's when it becomes a problem

106
0:3:23,19 --> 0:3:25,89
When I'm not afraid of the act of writing itself

107
0:3:25,89 --> 0:3:30,89
But rather the abstract fear of possibly failing at writing

108
0:3:30,89 --> 0:3:34,37
Or even being afraid of the fear itself

109
0:3:34,37 --> 0:3:36,37
One hum is one, two is the second level

110
0:3:36,37 --> 0:3:36,97
Fear of writing

111
0:3:36,97 --> 0:3:38,35
One is the third level, fear of writing

112
0:3:38,35 --> 0:3:40,27
This is a kind of abstract fear

113
0:3:40,27 --> 0:3:42,519
Similarly, abstract desires are not good either

114
0:3:42,519 --> 0:3:44,439
Like those corrupt officials who embezzled hundreds of millions

115
0:3:44,439 --> 0:3:45,339
As they go further down that path

116
0:3:45,339 --> 0:3:47,31
What does money mean to them?

117
0:3:47,31 --> 0:3:48,45
They are officials themselves

118
0:3:48,45 --> 0:3:49,47
He can't even spend it

119
0:3:49,47 --> 0:3:51,84
Then it's no longer about specific desires

120
0:3:51,84 --> 0:3:54,54
rather than a conceptulization of a thirst for numbers

121
0:3:54,54 --> 0:3:55,92
When someone tries to bribe him

122
0:3:55,92 --> 0:3:56,76
You should ask specifically

123
0:3:56,76 --> 0:3:57,84
You embezzled this million

124
0:3:57,84 --> 0:3:58,98
What are you going to do with it

125
0:3:58,98 --> 0:4:0,46
What do you plan to do with this money

126
0:4:0,46 --> 0:4:1,12
He doesn't know either

127
0:4:1,12 --> 0:4:3,12
This turns into an abstract inertia.

128
0:4:3,12 --> 0:4:6,529
Whether it's desire or fear that drives your motivation,

129
0:4:6,529 --> 0:4:8,589
your drive becomes ineffective if it’s not concrete,

130
0:4:8,589 --> 0:4:9,84
you’re more likely to be alienated,

131
0:4:9,84 --> 0:4:12,3
you become a slave to some concept, right?

132
0:4:12,3 --> 0:4:15,6
You’re not craving the material things money can buy,

133
0:4:15,6 --> 0:4:16,81
you’re not aiming to improve your life,

134
0:4:16,81 --> 0:4:18,68
you’re craving money itself,

135
0:4:18,68 --> 0:4:20,6
and money becomes the subject.

136
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:22,48
And you become the object, right?

137
0:4:22,48 --> 0:4:24,44
Or you don’t crave intimate relationships

138
0:4:24,44 --> 0:4:25,76
You don’t crave companionship

139
0:4:25,76 --> 0:4:28,0
You don’t crave the response from the person you love

140
0:4:28,0 --> 0:4:29,7
You simply can’t accept yourself

141
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:32,72
The failure that not being able to get married implies

142
0:4:32,72 --> 0:4:34,36
Then you become a slave to marriage

143
0:4:34,36 --> 0:4:36,16
So neither desire nor fear is the issue

144
0:4:36,16 --> 0:4:37,94
The issue is to be specific, not abstract

145
0:4:37,94 --> 0:4:38,9
Don't abstract it

146
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:39,8
But unfortunately

147
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:43,87
the motivations of Chinese youth are indeed very prone to abstraction

148
0:4:43,87 --> 0:4:45,17
we have to admit this

149
0:4:45,17 --> 0:4:47,57
First, they are instilled from a young age in an extremely isolated environment

150
0:4:47,57 --> 0:4:48,17
You must win

151
0:4:48,17 --> 0:4:49,57
the notion that you must be exceptionally outstanding

152
0:4:49,57 --> 0:4:51,69
It's hard to experience concrete happiness

153
0:4:51,69 --> 0:4:52,55
concrete joy

154
0:4:52,55 --> 0:4:53,54
Your motivation

155
0:4:53,54 --> 0:4:56,2
has been almost entirely external from a young age

156
0:4:56,2 --> 0:4:56,9
imposed on you

157
0:4:56,9 --> 0:4:57,64
demanded of you

158
0:4:57,64 --> 0:4:59,54
I mentioned this in my year-end reflection last year

159
0:4:59,54 --> 0:5:1,94
many people end up as hollow individuals due to such experiences during their growth

160
0:5:1,94 --> 0:5:3,3
becoming hollow people

161
0:5:3,3 --> 0:5:5,11
I have real-life friends who are like this

162
0:5:5,11 --> 0:5:6,23
I have a very close friend who

163
0:5:6,23 --> 0:5:7,77
A male classmate I've been in touch with all along

164
0:5:7,77 --> 0:5:9,25
He's been a top student from childhood to adulthood

165
0:5:9,25 --> 0:5:10,53
After graduation, he got a pretty good job

166
0:5:10,53 --> 0:5:11,919
But he's never been truly happy

167
0:5:11,919 --> 0:5:13,259
He wants to change his environment

168
0:5:13,259 --> 0:5:13,759
So

169
0:5:13,759 --> 0:5:16,219
At 35, he applied to a school in the Netherlands and went abroad to study

170
0:5:16,219 --> 0:5:18,34
Because his learning ability is really strong

171
0:5:18,34 --> 0:5:20,24
He's actually a very capable person

172
0:5:20,24 --> 0:5:21,72
So it was only natural that

173
0:5:21,72 --> 0:5:24,36
he made it to the Netherlands without any issues

174
0:5:24,36 --> 0:5:25,86
and in theory, his dream had come true

175
0:5:25,86 --> 0:5:27,27
But when I spoke to him last year

176
0:5:27,27 --> 0:5:29,31
he mentioned that he had achieved the top score in one of his courses

177
0:5:29,31 --> 0:5:32,84
among all students from all countries

178
0:5:32,84 --> 0:5:35,16
and his overall GPA was also among the top

179
0:5:35,16 --> 0:5:36,78
However, even with that

180
0:5:36,78 --> 0:5:38,44
he still felt that he wasn't good enough

181
0:5:38,44 --> 0:5:38,9
Why

182
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:40,58
Because he didn't come first in every subject

183
0:5:40,58 --> 0:5:41,99
I find this utterly absurd

184
0:5:41,99 --> 0:5:42,59
So I asked him

185
0:5:42,59 --> 0:5:44,67
I said, do you think this is fair?

186
0:5:44,67 --> 0:5:46,0
Don't you find it absurd?

187
0:5:46,0 --> 0:5:48,6
He said rationally he knows he did well enough

188
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:49,84
But rationality doesn't help

189
0:5:49,84 --> 0:5:51,59
Because of the momentum he's always had

190
0:5:51,59 --> 0:5:53,31
He just feels that he's not good enough

191
0:5:53,31 --> 0:5:54,19
No matter what

192
0:5:54,19 --> 0:5:55,63
As long as there's a better possibility

193
0:5:55,63 --> 0:5:56,99
He feels that he's not good enough

194
0:5:56,99 --> 0:5:58,53
He sees himself as inadequate

195
0:5:58,53 --> 0:6:1,35
This is a deeply ingrained way of thinking

196
0:6:1,35 --> 0:6:3,39
I know quite a few people like this

197
0:6:3,39 --> 0:6:5,39
Sometimes I think these friends might be lucky

198
0:6:5,39 --> 0:6:8,84
Because I've indeed been in key middle schools from a young age

199
0:6:8,84 --> 0:6:11,52
They might just be lucky, my friends around me.

200
0:6:11,52 --> 0:6:12,48
But they are all very capable.

201
0:6:12,48 --> 0:6:13,6
And they do tend to achieve better outcomes.

202
0:6:13,6 --> 0:6:15,94
These are the people who can manage to succeed.

203
0:6:15,94 --> 0:6:17,1
So for them,

204
0:6:17,1 --> 0:6:19,62
it's a cyclical process of self-doubt and self-affirmation,

205
0:6:19,62 --> 0:6:20,46
this kind of loop.

206
0:6:20,46 --> 0:6:23,16
But some people, when faced with such PUA,

207
0:6:23,16 --> 0:6:24,82
might end up falling into complete darkness.

208
0:6:24,82 --> 0:6:26,4
Abstract fear

209
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:28,68
is actually two sides of the same coin with abstract desire

210
0:6:28,68 --> 0:6:30,88
I don't know what I want

211
0:6:30,88 --> 0:6:31,94
What should we do then?

212
0:6:31,94 --> 0:6:33,64
I can only want to win, right?

213
0:6:33,64 --> 0:6:34,42
I want to win

214
0:6:34,42 --> 0:6:35,46
So I also fear losing

215
0:6:35,46 --> 0:6:36,6
I'm afraid I won't be able to win

216
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:38,52
I can't be someone worthy of everyone's approval

217
0:6:38,52 --> 0:6:39,96
So I became worthless.

218
0:6:39,96 --> 0:6:41,4
So at this point,

219
0:6:41,4 --> 0:6:44,2
abstract desire and abstract fear are one and the same.

220
0:6:44,2 --> 0:6:47,39
Another part is brought about by the internet media.

221
0:6:47,39 --> 0:6:47,719
Abstract fear,

222
0:6:47,719 --> 0:6:50,25
we are already overwhelmed with information.

223
0:6:50,25 --> 0:6:51,33
the media amplifies,

224
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:52,61
amplifies too much information,

225
0:6:52,61 --> 0:6:54,73
it gives you a lot of what seems like too many dark secrets.

226
0:6:54,73 --> 0:6:56,34
Too many extreme cases

227
0:6:56,34 --> 0:6:58,98
If young people don't have enough exposure to the real world

228
0:6:58,98 --> 0:7:1,6
Without a counterbalance of information and understanding of society

229
0:7:1,6 --> 0:7:5,1
The world in their eyes becomes a vast and mysterious

230
0:7:5,1 --> 0:7:5,66
Dangerous

231
0:7:5,66 --> 0:7:8,68
A deeply incomprehensible and unpredictable dark place

232
0:7:8,68 --> 0:7:10,72
In such an environment

233
0:7:10,72 --> 0:7:14,609
An ordinary person feels like a small boat in a storm

234
0:7:14,609 --> 0:7:16,29
It seems like there's no way out no matter which path they take

235
0:7:16,29 --> 0:7:17,309
No matter what choice we make, it seems to be the wrong one.

236
0:7:17,309 --> 0:7:19,189
So let's look at it from the perspective of motivation.

237
0:7:19,189 --> 0:7:20,289
The Dilemma of the New Generation

238
0:7:20,289 --> 0:7:21,689
It's just like what we mentioned earlier.

239
0:7:21,689 --> 0:7:23,469
Desires and fears have become abstract concepts.

240
0:7:23,469 --> 0:7:25,909
There's a phrase I've been thinking about a lot lately.

241
0:7:25,909 --> 0:7:28,64
Oh, this must be something a Bilibili UPloader often says.

242
0:7:28,64 --> 0:7:31,5
And it has become a commonly used meme.

243
0:7:31,5 --> 0:7:33,47
It's called 'a straight line turning into a dead end on both sides'.

244
0:7:33,47 --> 0:7:34,11
Up and down

245
0:7:34,11 --> 0:7:35,47
we shouldn’t be caught between a rock and a hard place

246
0:7:35,47 --> 0:7:36,67
For young people

247
0:7:36,67 --> 0:7:40,47
I think it’s quite realistic that a straightforward approach can lead to being blocked on both ends

248
0:7:40,47 --> 0:7:42,48
Our generation

249
0:7:42,48 --> 0:7:43,4
A new generation

250
0:7:43,4 --> 0:7:46,92
Their biological instinct for survival pressure is almost gone

251
0:7:46,92 --> 0:7:49,0
No matter whether you think society is good or bad

252
0:7:49,0 --> 0:7:51,0
Whether you think your life is good or bad

253
0:7:51,0 --> 0:7:52,24
But you have to admit

254
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:53,26
in such a society

255
0:7:53,26 --> 0:7:54,14
in our country

256
0:7:54,14 --> 0:7:56,64
it's not easy to starve to death, right?

257
0:7:56,64 --> 0:7:58,44
What about those higher pursuits?

258
0:7:58,44 --> 0:8:0,84
they're not so easy to attain

259
0:8:0,84 --> 0:8:1,94
you can't quite reach them

260
0:8:1,94 --> 0:8:3,1
these are two deer

261
0:8:3,1 --> 0:8:5,12
and then let's talk about the growing environment

262
0:8:5,12 --> 0:8:7,57
This sense of joy in living

263
0:8:7,57 --> 0:8:10,7
This relaxation is ruined by the education system

264
0:8:10,7 --> 0:8:11,57
It's destroyed by the environment from a young age

265
0:8:11,57 --> 0:8:15,91
But the opportunity for upward social mobility, the chance to succeed

266
0:8:15,91 --> 0:8:19,39
The opportunity to live better than others is rapidly shrinking

267
0:8:19,39 --> 0:8:21,22
The odds of winning are decreasing

268
0:8:21,22 --> 0:8:22,7
This is a double-edged sword

269
0:8:22,7 --> 0:8:24,95
And from a historical perspective

270
0:8:24,95 --> 0:8:27,69
The PUA tactics from pre-modern times haven't disappeared, right

271
0:8:27,69 --> 0:8:30,7
There are still many people urging you to get married

272
0:8:30,7 --> 0:8:32,94
Many tell you how to be a man

273
0:8:32,94 --> 0:8:34,62
How can one become a woman?

274
0:8:34,62 --> 0:8:36,26
These pre-modern notions haven't vanished

275
0:8:36,26 --> 0:8:41,19
While the benefits and diversity of modern life are gradually shrinking

276
0:8:41,19 --> 0:8:44,65
the sense of oppression and emptiness associated with modernity

277
0:8:44,65 --> 0:8:47,48
The hypocrisy and nihilism are sweeping in

278
0:8:47,48 --> 0:8:48,6
We have to face them

279
0:8:48,6 --> 0:8:51,29
And they come in the form of abstract negative emotions

280
0:8:51,29 --> 0:8:53,39
You don’t even know who to blame.

281
0:8:53,39 --> 0:8:55,17
So this is a double-edged sword.

282
0:8:55,17 --> 0:8:57,21
This is a convergence of pre-modern and modern elements.

283
0:8:57,21 --> 0:8:58,21
Last year’s year-end observations.

284
0:8:58,21 --> 0:8:59,49
I’ve also discussed similar structures.

285
0:8:59,49 --> 0:9:0,61
But I can elaborate further.

286
0:9:0,61 --> 0:9:2,43
Because it’s a core question of our time.

287
0:9:2,43 --> 0:9:3,75
This mental framework.

288
0:9:3,75 --> 0:9:5,75
I believe it will impact the spirit and vitality of a generation.

289
0:9:5,75 --> 0:9:7,79
What does this kind of deadlock bring?

290
0:9:7,79 --> 0:9:9,55
It brings a sense of constant unease,

291
0:9:9,55 --> 0:9:11,89
a feeling of not knowing where one truly belongs,

292
0:9:11,89 --> 0:9:13,1
who one really is,

293
0:9:13,1 --> 0:9:14,5
where one stands,

294
0:9:14,5 --> 0:9:15,71
and which path to take in life’s confusion.

295
0:9:15,71 --> 0:9:18,23
It’s a state of being both chaotic and dispirited,

296
0:9:18,23 --> 0:9:19,23
appearing chaotic on the surface,

297
0:9:19,23 --> 0:9:20,89
but fundamentally disheartened in spirit.

298
0:9:20,89 --> 0:9:24,59
I think the current generational conflict is between two or several generations

299
0:9:24,59 --> 0:9:26,37
The conflict in the public opinion field is so intense.

300
0:9:26,37 --> 0:9:27,97
they can hardly understand each other

301
0:9:27,97 --> 0:9:29,81
and a significant reason for this is

302
0:9:29,81 --> 0:9:30,41
the older generation

303
0:9:30,41 --> 0:9:32,91
really can't grasp this kind of manic and depressive mental state

304
0:9:32,91 --> 0:9:35,39
they can't understand this black hole in young people's hearts

305
0:9:35,39 --> 0:9:36,21
this void

306
0:9:36,21 --> 0:9:38,21
and the accompanying aimlessness

307
0:9:38,21 --> 0:9:39,49
It feels really tough

308
0:9:39,49 --> 0:9:42,1
because if you don't truly understand from the perspective of young people

309
0:9:42,1 --> 0:9:44,83
if you don't really observe and immerse yourself in their lives

310
0:9:44,83 --> 0:9:46,37
if you just look from the outside

311
0:9:46,37 --> 0:9:48,589
of course, you might think they're just whining, right?

312
0:9:48,589 --> 0:9:50,469
because the material conditions are indeed better

313
0:9:50,469 --> 0:9:52,13
and the education is better too

314
0:9:52,13 --> 0:9:55,1
but you guys still complain about more things

315
0:9:55,1 --> 0:9:59,5
and the older generation might wonder what's really wrong with you

316
0:9:59,5 --> 0:9:59,95
You don’t just come out and say it

317
0:9:59,95 --> 0:10:1,19
and you don’t communicate with them properly

318
0:10:1,19 --> 0:10:2,35
but what they don’t know is

319
0:10:2,35 --> 0:10:4,35
it’s precisely because you can’t express it that it hurts

320
0:10:4,35 --> 0:10:7,64
so when faced with such personal struggles

321
0:10:7,64 --> 0:10:9,56
there are actually different choices people can make

322
0:10:9,56 --> 0:10:11,6
some choose to just give up

323
0:10:11,6 --> 0:10:12,12
if you don’t take action

324
0:10:12,12 --> 0:10:14,2
action won’t go to waste, right?

325
0:10:14,2 --> 0:10:16,1
If you don’t choose, will you never choose wrong?

326
0:10:16,1 --> 0:10:17,2
You can’t face the problem.

327
0:10:17,2 --> 0:10:19,49
The problem can be temporarily kept at bay, right?

328
0:10:19,49 --> 0:10:23,11
It’s hard to say this is a rational and effective way of thinking.

329
0:10:23,11 --> 0:10:24,81
But it does align with human nature.

330
0:10:24,81 --> 0:10:26,6
It fits emotional patterns.

331
0:10:26,6 --> 0:10:27,5
What’s another option?

332
0:10:27,5 --> 0:10:30,36
Since I can’t obtain a value I can endorse,

333
0:10:30,36 --> 0:10:32,92
I’ll destroy all value.

334
0:10:32,92 --> 0:10:34,2
I deconstruct everything

335
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:35,1
I mock everything

336
0:10:35,1 --> 0:10:35,94
I see through everything

337
0:10:35,94 --> 0:10:36,7
I ridicule everything

338
0:10:36,7 --> 0:10:38,28
I pretend as if I don't exist in this world

339
0:10:38,28 --> 0:10:40,2
the things that matter and are worth pursuing

340
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:40,98
that's also a choice

341
0:10:40,98 --> 0:10:43,26
then the other choice is even more dangerous

342
0:10:43,26 --> 0:10:45,48
which is that I can't find any value

343
0:10:45,48 --> 0:10:48,44
So I compensate with a sense of power

344
0:10:48,44 --> 0:10:50,44
to fill the void of value

345
0:10:50,44 --> 0:10:52,56
to fill the void of value

346
0:10:52,56 --> 0:10:54,38
if you can't find value, seek power

347
0:10:54,38 --> 0:10:56,349
So what is the most direct form of power?

348
0:10:56,349 --> 0:11:0,49
Harming others is the most efficient way to prove one's strength

349
0:11:0,49 --> 0:11:1,569
This is what I've mentioned

350
0:11:1,569 --> 0:11:4,69
the psychological mechanism behind the community of hatred

351
0:11:4,69 --> 0:11:5,95
And when we look back at history

352
0:11:5,95 --> 0:11:8,19
We can also observe the changes in each cycle.

353
0:11:8,19 --> 0:11:11,609
When society reaches a point where values become hollow,

354
0:11:11,609 --> 0:11:15,589
it is also a time when the public desperately seeks a sense of power.

355
0:11:15,589 --> 0:11:16,949
a sense of empowerment.

356
0:11:16,949 --> 0:11:19,369
So we can see many phenomena in the public opinion field now.

357
0:11:19,369 --> 0:11:21,66
Many hot topics, at their core,

358
0:11:21,66 --> 0:11:23,74
are a mix of the three choices mentioned above.

359
0:11:23,74 --> 0:11:25,58
Many issues are not about right or wrong,

360
0:11:25,58 --> 0:11:26,6
nor are they about

361
0:11:26,6 --> 0:11:28,54
The matter itself is about hunting games.

362
0:11:28,54 --> 0:11:29,98
Everyone focuses on

363
0:11:29,98 --> 0:11:32,53
issues that are almost devoid of public interest.

364
0:11:32,53 --> 0:11:35,81
Using the majority's correctness to ostracize the minority.

365
0:11:35,81 --> 0:11:37,83
And this minority isn't necessarily wrong.

366
0:11:37,83 --> 0:11:39,93
They might just be unpopular.

367
0:11:39,93 --> 0:11:41,91
Or they happen to represent

368
0:11:41,91 --> 0:11:44,91
something that reflects widespread dissatisfaction.

369
0:11:44,91 --> 0:11:47,53
I'm not talking about the 4+4 at Xiehe here.

370
0:11:47,53 --> 0:11:49,15
Or the Shanxi case, such a hot topic

371
0:11:49,15 --> 0:11:51,23
Such incidents are rare

372
0:11:51,23 --> 0:11:53,51
Truly, some events have public value

373
0:11:53,51 --> 0:11:54,41
Actually, there are many

374
0:11:54,41 --> 0:11:55,35
What am I talking about?

375
0:11:55,35 --> 0:11:58,4
I'm referring to whether He Classmate refused to give a positive review for a taxi ride

376
0:11:58,4 --> 0:12:0,44
Fang Qi's disrespect towards Ye Tong

377
0:12:0,44 --> 0:12:3,4
How Xiao Ming and his wife manage to live their lives with modeling

378
0:12:3,4 --> 0:12:3,88
These kinds of trivial matters

379
0:12:3,88 --> 0:12:6,14
This kind of thing happens in similar situations

380
0:12:6,14 --> 0:12:8,2
People rely on moral judgments of others

381
0:12:8,2 --> 0:12:10,18
on these targets of criticism

382
0:12:10,18 --> 0:12:14,32
by shaming their character to inflict what they call righteous harm

383
0:12:14,32 --> 0:12:18,44
and then by observing the harm being inflicted

384
0:12:18,44 --> 0:12:21,95
seeing their fear or cries

385
0:12:21,95 --> 0:12:24,15
or the cries of people from the other side

386
0:12:24,15 --> 0:12:26,43
they achieve a kind of inner climax, right?

387
0:12:26,43 --> 0:12:29,17
This climax, in their view, might be seen as punishing evil and promoting good

388
0:12:29,17 --> 0:12:31,79
But how much is actually included in this?

389
0:12:31,79 --> 0:12:33,43
I see the harm I cause.

390
0:12:33,43 --> 0:12:34,55
So I exist.

391
0:12:34,55 --> 0:12:35,71
So I have strength.

392
0:12:35,71 --> 0:12:38,18
Such a highly damp positive feedback

393
0:12:38,18 --> 0:12:39,6
I think there's quite a bit.

394
0:12:39,6 --> 0:12:40,46
Sure.

395
0:12:40,46 --> 0:12:43,3
You can interpret the above as my analysis of the situation.

396
0:12:43,3 --> 0:12:44,8
Or a causal logic.

397
0:12:44,8 --> 0:12:47,2
I admit it's a form of criticism

398
0:12:47,2 --> 0:12:50,18
but if you happen to be the type mentioned

399
0:12:50,18 --> 0:12:52,569
someone who compensates for a sense of value with a sense of power

400
0:12:52,569 --> 0:12:54,409
how can I provide you with a solution?

401
0:12:54,409 --> 0:12:55,749
offering a solution isn't easy

402
0:12:55,749 --> 0:12:58,37
because the approach to avoid abstracting your motivation

403
0:12:58,37 --> 0:12:59,65
seems pretty straightforward, right?

404
0:12:59,65 --> 0:13:0,41
it's just a matter of saying it

405
0:13:0,41 --> 0:13:2,4
it's about making yourself and your life more concrete

406
0:13:2,4 --> 0:13:4,16
But it's not about having a certain attitude

407
0:13:4,16 --> 0:13:5,1
It's about having a certain ability

408
0:13:5,1 --> 0:13:7,79
You need to have something concrete

409
0:13:7,79 --> 0:13:9,63
You need to have something tangible

410
0:13:9,63 --> 0:13:10,89
You need to be sensitive enough

411
0:13:10,89 --> 0:13:12,97
You need to have experienced truly great things

412
0:13:12,97 --> 0:13:14,61
You need to see yourself and others

413
0:13:14,61 --> 0:13:15,97
Only then can you become specific

414
0:13:15,97 --> 0:13:16,93
And it's crucial

415
0:13:16,93 --> 0:13:18,49
You need to have enough mental space

416
0:13:18,49 --> 0:13:19,77
You need to have a kind of psychological energy

417
0:13:19,77 --> 0:13:20,98
Only then can you live well

418
0:13:20,98 --> 0:13:23,1
You can't be someone who is completely drained

419
0:13:23,1 --> 0:13:24,46
Depleted and exhausted

420
0:13:24,46 --> 0:13:27,1
Then, as mentioned in the video Bilibili released for Youth Day this year,

421
0:13:27,1 --> 0:13:28,22
A very terrifying term

422
0:13:28,22 --> 0:13:29,57
It refers to someone who has been erased

423
0:13:29,57 --> 0:13:31,89
In such a state, you cannot be specific

424
0:13:31,89 --> 0:13:32,89
So what should we do?

425
0:13:32,89 --> 0:13:35,309
The solution I came up with might not be right.

426
0:13:35,309 --> 0:13:38,589
Just try to be an unrefined egoist.

427
0:13:38,589 --> 0:13:39,909
Or to put it more bluntly,

428
0:13:39,909 --> 0:13:41,46
don't be too selfless.

429
0:13:41,46 --> 0:13:43,96
Don't keep trying to meet others' expectations.

430
0:13:43,96 --> 0:13:46,38
Don't keep trying to meet society's expectations.

431
0:13:46,38 --> 0:13:47,68
Don't keep trying to meet your parents' expectations.

432
0:13:47,68 --> 0:13:51,2
Don't keep condemning things in the name of justice.

433
0:13:51,2 --> 0:13:52,7
To speak up for the weak

434
0:13:52,7 --> 0:13:55,1
and constantly fight against what you perceive as

435
0:13:55,1 --> 0:13:56,9
ugly social phenomena

436
0:13:56,9 --> 0:13:58,58
I think what's more important is

437
0:13:58,58 --> 0:14:1,39
you seem to be caught in this emotional storm

438
0:14:1,39 --> 0:14:3,5
this storm of righteousness

439
0:14:3,5 --> 0:14:4,69
when you have this urge to fight

440
0:14:4,69 --> 0:14:5,81
then you're browsing Bilibili

441
0:14:5,81 --> 0:14:6,47
or Douyin

442
0:14:6,47 --> 0:14:7,35
While browsing Zhihu,

443
0:14:7,35 --> 0:14:8,25
think about it,

444
0:14:8,25 --> 0:14:11,53
what exactly have I gained from this process?

445
0:14:11,53 --> 0:14:13,41
Don't just focus on the positive energy in society.

446
0:14:13,41 --> 0:14:15,26
You focus on your positive energy

447
0:14:15,26 --> 0:14:18,46
I believe in the face of such a historical cycle,

448
0:14:18,46 --> 0:14:21,26
we should be more sparing with our emotions and how we expend them,

449
0:14:21,26 --> 0:14:23,95
don’t force yourself to do things for others,

450
0:14:23,95 --> 0:14:26,31
or to fight against so-called evil forces.

451
0:14:26,31 --> 0:14:28,59
Stop suppressing what makes you unhappy

452
0:14:28,59 --> 0:14:29,55
what angers you

453
0:14:29,55 --> 0:14:30,75
what makes you feel helpless

454
0:14:30,75 --> 0:14:32,81
the pain and confusion

455
0:14:32,81 --> 0:14:34,22
but instead, stay away from them

456
0:14:34,22 --> 0:14:35,36
stay away from these issues

457
0:14:35,36 --> 0:14:37,62
think about what you really need

458
0:14:37,62 --> 0:14:40,15
how to make yourself happier and more relaxed

459
0:14:40,15 --> 0:14:41,83
at this level

460
0:14:41,83 --> 0:14:42,91
meaningless entertainment

461
0:14:42,91 --> 0:14:44,59
going overboard with absurdity

462
0:14:44,59 --> 0:14:47,1
meaningless consumption are not issues

463
0:14:47,1 --> 0:14:48,43
as long as they replenish you

464
0:14:48,43 --> 0:14:48,91
nourish you

465
0:14:48,91 --> 0:14:50,25
rather than drain you

466
0:14:50,25 --> 0:14:54,3
I don't think it's really that hard to judge

467
0:14:54,3 --> 0:14:55,68
after you do these things

468
0:14:55,68 --> 0:14:57,32
are you more exhausted

469
0:14:57,32 --> 0:14:58,24
more empty

470
0:14:58,24 --> 0:14:59,22
more sleepless

471
0:14:59,22 --> 0:15:0,2
unable to sleep

472
0:15:0,2 --> 0:15:0,97
more numb

473
0:15:0,97 --> 0:15:3,73
or do you feel some satisfaction

474
0:15:3,73 --> 0:15:5,89
more energized

475
0:15:5,89 --> 0:15:6,429
you sleep better

476
0:15:6,429 --> 0:15:8,29
your mind is more active

477
0:15:8,29 --> 0:15:10,47
and you are more perceptive of yourself and others

478
0:15:10,47 --> 0:15:12,57
I think we can actually feel it

479
0:15:12,57 --> 0:15:14,9
if you really want to feel it

480
0:15:14,9 --> 0:15:16,92
So my answer is that this world might not be all that great.

481
0:15:16,92 --> 0:15:19,46
but we should be kinder to ourselves

482
0:15:19,46 --> 0:15:20,56
be kinder to yourself

483
0:15:20,56 --> 0:15:22,0
so you can be kinder to society

484
0:15:22,0 --> 0:15:23,6
so you can create a positive feedback loop

485
0:15:23,6 --> 0:15:24,56
take better care of yourself

486
0:15:24,56 --> 0:15:25,79
worry less about trivial matters

487
0:15:25,79 --> 0:15:28,589
because humans are very limited beings

488
0:15:28,589 --> 0:15:29,669
our emotions

489
0:15:29,669 --> 0:15:30,349
our attention

490
0:15:30,349 --> 0:15:32,469
our goodwill are all very limited

491
0:15:32,469 --> 0:15:34,949
Then, make sure to leave more space for your mental world.

492
0:15:34,949 --> 0:15:36,789
so you can accommodate real people

493
0:15:36,789 --> 0:15:38,5
and the real world

494
0:15:38,5 --> 0:15:41,27
otherwise, everything becomes abstract concern

495
0:15:41,27 --> 0:15:43,77
otherwise, your motivation system will become abstract

496
0:15:43,77 --> 0:15:45,97
and your concern will become abstract

497
0:15:45,97 --> 0:15:47,29
the road to hell

498
0:15:47,29 --> 0:15:49,96
is paved with such abstract goodwill

499
0:15:49,96 --> 0:15:52,8
I quite like a phrase that has been often repeated in recent years

500
0:15:52,8 --> 0:15:53,68
it's called respecting others' destinies

501
0:15:53,68 --> 0:15:55,3
letting go of the savior complex

502
0:15:55,3 --> 0:15:56,53
So, at the end of this video

503
0:15:56,53 --> 0:16:0,53
I wish all the young people could truly see their concrete selves

504
0:16:0,53 --> 0:16:2,22
thanks a lot, everyone

505
0:16:2,22 --> 0:16:3,28
wish you a happy holiday

506
0:16:3,28 --> 0:16:4,36
friends

507
0:16:4,36 --> 0:16:8,709
we believe that the hardships of 100 years ago have not been erased

508
0:16:8,709 --> 0:16:9,829
Chinese youth

509
0:16:9,829 --> 0:16:13,9
Chinese youth will never be erased by anxiety
