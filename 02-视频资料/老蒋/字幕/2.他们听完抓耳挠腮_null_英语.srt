1
0:0:3,56 --> 0:0:5,4
Hey there, buddy.

2
0:0:7,52 --> 0:0:9,93
You said that nowadays people only have companions.

3
0:0:9,93 --> 0:0:11,55
No friends, no colleagues.

4
0:0:11,55 --> 0:0:12,61
Those are work companions.

5
0:0:12,61 --> 0:0:14,46
We spend a considerable amount of time together each week.

6
0:0:14,46 --> 0:0:16,16
About 40 hours in total.

7
0:0:16,16 --> 0:0:17,82
But after work, though,

8
0:0:17,82 --> 0:0:19,28
if we pass each other on the street,

9
0:0:19,28 --> 0:0:20,82
we might not even say hello to each other.

10
0:0:20,82 --> 0:0:21,54
Chatting

11
0:0:21,54 --> 0:0:22,54
with someone to vent to

12
0:0:22,54 --> 0:0:24,48
and a gossip buddy, right?

13
0:0:24,48 --> 0:0:25,96
we can complain together about

14
0:0:25,96 --> 0:0:27,74
the weirdos we've met recently

15
0:0:27,74 --> 0:0:29,7
and talk a lot in the group chat every day

16
0:0:29,7 --> 0:0:32,14
but we might not see each other in person more than once a year

17
0:0:32,14 --> 0:0:33,32
there's also a dining partner

18
0:0:33,32 --> 0:0:33,94
and a drinking buddy

19
0:0:33,94 --> 0:0:34,93
Party buddies

20
0:0:34,93 --> 0:0:37,39
We might gather for dinner every Friday

21
0:0:37,39 --> 0:0:39,15
have drinks and hang out

22
0:0:39,15 --> 0:0:40,69
sing and have a great time

23
0:0:40,69 --> 0:0:41,74
get cozy and close

24
0:0:41,74 --> 0:0:42,9
seen each other a bit tipsy

25
0:0:42,9 --> 0:0:43,84
even puke in front of each other

26
0:0:43,84 --> 0:0:45,18
but if you really dig deeper

27
0:0:45,18 --> 0:0:46,74
we haven't had any heart-to-heart talks

28
0:0:46,74 --> 0:0:48,82
Most likely, they don't even know what the other person does for a living.

29
0:0:48,82 --> 0:0:49,66
Lunch buddy

30
0:0:49,66 --> 0:0:50,4
Drinking buddy

31
0:0:50,4 --> 0:0:51,38
Photo-taking buddy

32
0:0:51,38 --> 0:0:52,38
Travel buddy

33
0:0:52,38 --> 0:0:53,38
Group chat buddy

34
0:0:53,38 --> 0:0:54,76
We're all buddies

35
0:0:54,76 --> 0:0:57,6
We serve as containers and tools for each other

36
0:0:57,6 --> 0:0:57,94
Clean and simple

37
0:0:57,94 --> 0:0:59,58
One encounter, one relationship

38
0:0:59,58 --> 0:1:0,86
We don't need that anymore

39
0:1:0,86 --> 0:1:2,36
After all, we can have a bed buddy

40
0:1:2,36 --> 0:1:3,46
We can have a dating partner

41
0:1:3,46 --> 0:1:4,22
We can have a male best friend

42
0:1:4,22 --> 0:1:5,62
We can have a female bro, right?

43
0:1:5,62 --> 0:1:7,58
What if bed buddies fall for each other?

44
0:1:7,58 --> 0:1:8,58
And accidentally say something like

45
0:1:8,58 --> 0:1:9,58
I like you

46
0:1:9,58 --> 0:1:11,38
It was enough to make you break out in a cold sweat right there.

47
0:1:11,38 --> 0:1:13,92
The next day, you’d be kicking yourself and scrambling for solutions.

48
0:1:13,92 --> 0:1:16,0
She deliberately let on that she had other male contestants in mind.

49
0:1:16,0 --> 0:1:16,52
female contestants,

50
0:1:16,52 --> 0:1:17,54
just to avoid any misunderstandings.

51
0:1:17,54 --> 0:1:18,88
Even if they occasionally dated someone,

52
0:1:18,88 --> 0:1:19,94
it was more like a trial run,

53
0:1:19,94 --> 0:1:21,36
not thinking of committing to a long-term relationship.

54
0:1:21,36 --> 0:1:22,99
staying true to one person all the way through.

55
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:25,52
That's a bit too old school.

56
0:1:32,82 --> 0:1:33,68
Hey, dog.

57
0:1:33,68 --> 0:1:35,88
I was thinking it wasn't like this before.

58
0:1:35,88 --> 0:1:39,9
Back then, people were only nodding acquaintances.

59
0:1:39,9 --> 0:1:40,99
Then casual friends.

60
0:1:40,99 --> 0:1:41,81
Good Friends

61
0:1:41,81 --> 0:1:43,33
And really close friends.

62
0:1:43,33 --> 0:1:45,0
We were all complete individuals.

63
0:1:45,0 --> 0:1:47,48
There was a huge gray area between us.

64
0:1:47,48 --> 0:1:49,2
When you hit it off and mutually recognize each other

65
0:1:49,2 --> 0:1:50,7
the relationship can deepen

66
0:1:50,7 --> 0:1:53,64
Indeed, some relationships are about providing value to each other

67
0:1:53,64 --> 0:1:56,88
But there isn’t a clear-cut boundary in between

68
0:1:56,88 --> 0:1:58,22
that neither party should cross

69
0:1:58,22 --> 0:2:0,4
Of course, colleagues can be friends

70
0:2:0,4 --> 0:2:1,83
Pen pals can meet in person too

71
0:2:1,83 --> 0:2:3,89
But later, I came to realize

72
0:2:3,89 --> 0:2:6,3
This is actually quite normal

73
0:2:6,3 --> 0:2:8,48
When you really think about it, friends can be quite scary.

74
0:2:8,48 --> 0:2:10,46
What if a friend and their significant other have a fight?

75
0:2:10,46 --> 0:2:11,0
They get emo.

76
0:2:11,0 --> 0:2:12,0
And they call to say

77
0:2:12,0 --> 0:2:13,32
they want to come over to vent and talk it out.

78
0:2:13,32 --> 0:2:14,2
Then maybe stay over for the night.

79
0:2:14,2 --> 0:2:15,2
You know, that’s what friends are for.

80
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:16,38
I can’t just turn them away, can I?

81
0:2:16,38 --> 0:2:17,76
Or what if a friend has surgery?

82
0:2:17,76 --> 0:2:19,72
I have to go check on you in the hospital, right?

83
0:2:19,72 --> 0:2:21,8
You and your friend both got pretty tipsy.

84
0:2:21,8 --> 0:2:22,98
You talked about everything.

85
0:2:22,98 --> 0:2:24,88
Then you mentioned another mutual friend.

86
0:2:24,88 --> 0:2:26,34
He really can't stand that person.

87
0:2:26,34 --> 0:2:27,87
I actually really like that person.

88
0:2:27,87 --> 0:2:29,97
Before we knew it, we started to clash.

89
0:2:29,97 --> 0:2:31,45
It ended up ruining the evening.

90
0:2:31,45 --> 0:2:32,83
Things have been awkward ever since.

91
0:2:32,83 --> 0:2:34,4
We should still find a chance to reconcile, right?

92
0:2:34,4 --> 0:2:36,46
So once friends get close enough,

93
0:2:36,46 --> 0:2:38,94
those social boundaries will eventually break down.

94
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:41,3
And real life is full of surprises.

95
0:2:41,3 --> 0:2:41,79
As friends,

96
0:2:41,79 --> 0:2:42,95
you need to be there for each other,

97
0:2:42,95 --> 0:2:44,71
to handle the uncertainties that might come up.

98
0:2:44,71 --> 0:2:46,5
But what's the issue?

99
0:2:46,5 --> 0:2:48,7
It's about friends from the pre-Internet era.

100
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:49,49
We all know each other inside out

101
0:2:49,49 --> 0:2:51,58
Either we're colleagues

102
0:2:51,58 --> 0:2:52,94
Or people who work together

103
0:2:52,94 --> 0:2:54,82
Or our parents know each other

104
0:2:54,82 --> 0:2:55,82
Or we're neighbors

105
0:2:55,82 --> 0:2:57,64
But where can you find such an environment nowadays?

106
0:2:57,64 --> 0:2:59,98
New people you meet are like dark boxes

107
0:2:59,98 --> 0:3:2,8
It's hard to say what's really inside

108
0:3:2,8 --> 0:3:4,66
So, from another perspective

109
0:3:4,66 --> 0:3:5,92
You go out to make friends

110
0:3:5,92 --> 0:3:6,82
You go out to fall in love

111
0:3:6,82 --> 0:3:10,25
It's like giving someone else the chance and the right to hurt you

112
0:3:10,25 --> 0:3:11,95
We're all human, after all

113
0:3:11,95 --> 0:3:14,51
How many times can a person be hurt, really?

114
0:3:14,51 --> 0:3:15,51
More importantly

115
0:3:15,51 --> 0:3:16,79
We're not just cold towards others

116
0:3:16,79 --> 0:3:18,87
We're also just as indifferent to ourselves

117
0:3:18,87 --> 0:3:19,63
Just as distant

118
0:3:19,63 --> 0:3:22,65
You said that when studying from a young age, you shouldn't consider your interests and hobbies.

119
0:3:22,65 --> 0:3:25,71
When working, you shouldn't think about whether it's comfortable or not.

120
0:3:25,71 --> 0:3:27,47
When talking to your boss,

121
0:3:27,47 --> 0:3:30,15
you can't really care about things like dignity.

122
0:3:30,15 --> 0:3:31,84
Even with the closest relationships,

123
0:3:31,84 --> 0:3:33,72
if couples argue,

124
0:3:33,72 --> 0:3:35,54
sometimes you can't just stick to the facts.

125
0:3:35,54 --> 0:3:37,88
When we treat others as partners,

126
0:3:37,88 --> 0:3:40,83
we've already turned ourselves into strangers.

127
0:3:40,83 --> 0:3:43,5
You can only barely survive like this.

128
0:3:43,5 --> 0:3:46,24
We can't even call ourselves complete, natural beings anymore.

129
0:3:46,24 --> 0:3:48,4
So, we can only look for partners outside, right?

130
0:3:48,4 --> 0:3:49,48
I don't even know myself.

131
0:3:49,48 --> 0:3:52,28
What's inside this black box of mine?

132
0:3:52,28 --> 0:3:54,31
I don't want to know what others are like either.

133
0:3:54,31 --> 0:3:55,67
To avoid being shocked,

134
0:3:55,67 --> 0:3:55,99
I

135
0:3:55,99 --> 0:3:59,17
would rather give up those surprises and warmth as well.

136
0:3:59,17 --> 0:4:2,539
We show each other the side we've designed to present.

137
0:4:2,539 --> 0:4:5,459
We exchange a limited amount of value within our control.

138
0:4:5,459 --> 0:4:6,279
Happily.

139
0:4:6,279 --> 0:4:7,239
Casually.

140
0:4:7,239 --> 0:4:8,45
Without owing anything to each other.

141
0:4:8,45 --> 0:4:9,71
It's all good this way.

142
0:4:9,71 --> 0:4:11,35
I think I understand it now.

143
0:4:11,35 --> 0:4:14,75
But seeing you guys being completely open and honest with each other,

144
0:4:14,75 --> 0:4:16,4
Treating each other with sincerity,

145
0:4:16,4 --> 0:4:17,529
Spending every day together,

146
0:4:17,529 --> 0:4:18,909
Fighting when it's time to fight,

147
0:4:18,909 --> 0:4:20,349
Hugging when it's time to hug,

148
0:4:20,349 --> 0:4:22,169
There's not so much complexity between us,

149
0:4:22,169 --> 0:4:24,689
It's like treating each other as just another dog.

150
0:4:24,689 --> 0:4:26,43
So I can't help but wonder,

151
0:4:26,43 --> 0:4:27,35
From outside the cage,

152
0:4:27,35 --> 0:4:29,19
We see inside the cage,

153
0:4:29,19 --> 0:4:32,35
Do you ever have a moment where you're not sure,

154
0:4:32,35 --> 0:4:34,85
Who's really in the cage?

155
0:4:35,21 --> 0:4:36,76
What do you think, dog?
