1
0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:0,36
Hello everyone

2
0:0:0,36 --> 0:0:1,26
I'm Old Jiang

3
0:0:1,26 --> 0:0:3,96
Let's start breaking down the BILIBILI UP100 with three sentences.

4
0:0:5,64 --> 0:0:8,46
The first keyword in Xiao Qiao's speech is relational

5
0:0:8,46 --> 0:0:10,0
or what we might call family

6
0:0:10,0 --> 0:0:12,4
There are countless humorous media creators

7
0:0:12,4 --> 0:0:13,6
but Dean Xiao Chao stands out

8
0:0:13,6 --> 0:0:15,88
If you analyze it from an academic perspective

9
0:0:15,88 --> 0:0:17,36
Xiao Chao doesn't keep a diary

10
0:0:17,36 --> 0:0:19,84
The content is almost devoid of information.

11
0:0:19,84 --> 0:0:21,78
The jokes are often outdated.

12
0:0:21,78 --> 0:0:25,42
The production quality and editing also seem quite average.

13
0:0:25,42 --> 0:0:26,38
The pacing is just okay.

14
0:0:26,38 --> 0:0:27,68
But these things aren't crucial.

15
0:0:27,68 --> 0:0:31,24
Audiences watch Xiao Chao and Mai Gou for the same reason.

16
0:0:31,24 --> 0:0:34,249
Music is just the excuse for everyone to gather.

17
0:0:34,249 --> 0:0:36,409
It's fine even if our DER sings off-key.

18
0:0:36,409 --> 0:0:37,42
What truly matters is...

19
0:0:37,42 --> 0:0:40,8
It's the bond and shared experiences among band members

20
0:0:40,8 --> 0:0:42,52
It's this relational aspect that's truly crucial

21
0:0:42,52 --> 0:0:44,7
The benefits of this relational aspect are immense

22
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:47,12
The stickiness of Xiaoyuan's account is remarkably high

23
0:0:47,12 --> 0:0:49,68
His average view count is approaching the number of his followers.

24
0:0:49,68 --> 0:0:51,84
I counted the 20 episodes of videos that Dean Xiao Chen borrowed.

25
0:0:51,84 --> 0:0:53,84
Totaling 245 million views

26
0:0:53,84 --> 0:0:55,42
With an average of over 12 million views per episode

27
0:0:55,42 --> 0:0:57,76
In comparison to Film Storm, which has a similar scale

28
0:0:57,76 --> 0:1:0,86
Film Storm has only 21.3 million views on average over the last 20 episodes.

29
0:1:0,86 --> 0:1:3,8
This comparison is not to say that Film Storm has poor traffic.

30
0:1:3,8 --> 0:1:5,52
It's just that President Xiao Chao's numbers are unrealistically high.

31
0:1:5,52 --> 0:1:5,92
So, moving on,

32
0:1:5,92 --> 0:1:7,56
I also checked my own view counts,

33
0:1:7,56 --> 0:1:10,22
The total views for my last two videos are 9.8 million.

34
0:1:10,22 --> 0:1:13,93
The total views for 20 episodes don't match up to President Xiao Chao's single episode.

35
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:15,13
Additionally, regarding the relationship,

36
0:1:15,13 --> 0:1:15,97
there's also the matter of revenue.

37
0:1:15,97 --> 0:1:16,89
Dean Xiao Chen's team

38
0:1:16,89 --> 0:1:19,62
has an astonishing ability to incubate new channel matrices

39
0:1:19,62 --> 0:1:22,42
every member of Captain Xiao's team has high IP stickiness

40
0:1:22,42 --> 0:1:22,82
abstract

41
0:1:22,82 --> 0:1:25,24
Most of them are creators with an average view count higher than their follower count.

42
0:1:25,24 --> 0:1:25,88
to be honest

43
0:1:25,88 --> 0:1:28,18
major influencer teams aren't short of IP matrices

44
0:1:28,18 --> 0:1:31,4
but generally, they only incubate one or two subsidiary IPs

45
0:1:31,4 --> 0:1:34,1
and these sub-IPs can't independently form a strong presence

46
0:1:34,1 --> 0:1:36,4
They need to collaborate with the main account of the master.

47
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:37,1
Only then can they achieve significant traffic.

48
0:1:37,1 --> 0:1:39,13
For example, the Film Storm team.

49
0:1:39,13 --> 0:1:40,23
We know Qingqingzi,

50
0:1:40,23 --> 0:1:41,23
and we know Li Siwei.

51
0:1:41,23 --> 0:1:45,5
But this is a manifestation of the main Film Storm account's influence spilling over.

52
0:1:45,5 --> 0:1:48,54
It's quite different from the widespread presence of IP like Dean Xiaochao.

53
0:1:48,54 --> 0:1:49,5
There is a fundamental difference.

54
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:50,26
The Xiaochao team

55
0:1:50,26 --> 0:1:52,48
It's essentially the most impressive IP universe you can find within the Chinese internet.

56
0:1:52,48 --> 0:1:54,44
So, the benefits of these relational ties are an exaggerated level of stickiness and this IP universe.

57
0:1:54,44 --> 0:1:54,98
Alright.

58
0:1:54,98 --> 0:1:58,3
But what's the cost?

59
0:1:58,3 --> 0:1:59,44
The cost is that the audience has particularly high demands for the authenticity of the content from these small team leaders.

60
0:1:59,44 --> 0:2:1,24
I wonder if anyone has noticed,

61
0:2:1,24 --> 0:2:3,86
most of these highly interactive comedy creators.

62
0:2:7,54 --> 0:2:9,6
To have more control over the content

63
0:2:9,6 --> 0:2:10,639
the show's effects are all purely acted

64
0:2:10,639 --> 0:2:11,719
this can really offend people

65
0:2:11,719 --> 0:2:12,999
I won't give specific examples

66
0:2:12,999 --> 0:2:14,59
but it's really obvious

67
0:2:14,59 --> 0:2:15,399
many channels don't even bother to act

68
0:2:15,399 --> 0:2:16,239
it's just pure script

69
0:2:16,239 --> 0:2:17,8
audiences don't really mind

70
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:19,52
as long as you have the show's effect

71
0:2:19,52 --> 0:2:20,64
I don't really care whether it's acted or not

72
0:2:20,64 --> 0:2:22,76
But if the elementary school principal does it, there will be an issue

73
0:2:22,76 --> 0:2:23,86
Because the audience would think

74
0:2:23,86 --> 0:2:25,4
Since you're in the video

75
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:26,98
Your interactions can be staged

76
0:2:26,98 --> 0:2:27,94
What about outside the video?

77
0:2:27,94 --> 0:2:30,2
Could your relationship possibly be staged as well?

78
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:31,82
That would become a significant problem

79
0:2:31,82 --> 0:2:34,0
Enough to shake the audience's fundamental trust in them

80
0:2:34,0 --> 0:2:37,24
So that's the price they pay. The second key point is conflict.

81
0:2:37,24 --> 0:2:38,68
Comedy requires conflict.

82
0:2:38,68 --> 0:2:41,43
What is the most common conflict in Dean Xiao's videos?

83
0:2:41,43 --> 0:2:44,77
The most common is the conflict arising from the unequal relationship between boss and employee.

84
0:2:44,77 --> 0:2:47,51
For example, Xiao Chao uses his boss status to bully employees.

85
0:2:47,51 --> 0:2:49,4
But then gets turned around and pranked by the employees.

86
0:2:49,4 --> 0:2:50,84
Turning the tables on Xiao Chao.

87
0:2:50,84 --> 0:2:53,9
And ultimately gets punished after the game ends.

88
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:55,45
Many of his episodes, when it comes down to it,

89
0:2:55,45 --> 0:2:56,49
That's pretty much it.

90
0:2:56,49 --> 0:2:57,6
The core is just that.

91
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:58,92
Now, between the boss and the employees,

92
0:2:58,92 --> 0:3:1,68
the conflict mechanism of cooperative competition among employees,

93
0:3:1,68 --> 0:3:3,3
is a key element of Xiao Chao comedy.

94
0:3:3,3 --> 0:3:5,52
It creates a very simple suspense.

95
0:3:5,52 --> 0:3:7,58
It's quite similar to Tom and Jerry,

96
0:3:7,58 --> 0:3:8,28
In Tom and Jerry,

97
0:3:8,28 --> 0:3:9,3
this adversarial relationship

98
0:3:9,3 --> 0:3:13,14
It provides suspense, tension, and a source of humor for the comedy.

99
0:3:13,14 --> 0:3:15,17
The underlying friendship between them,

100
0:3:15,17 --> 0:3:18,33
however, can alleviate the discomfort caused by this conflict.

101
0:3:18,33 --> 0:3:21,18
Just like how Tom always tries to catch Jerry and punish him,

102
0:3:21,18 --> 0:3:22,24
but doesn’t want to kill him.

103
0:3:22,24 --> 0:3:23,22
The audience understands that

104
0:3:23,22 --> 0:3:26,2
Neptune and Xiao Yang won’t really be fired or fined,

105
0:3:26,2 --> 0:3:28,34
which aligns with the fundamental principle of comedy,

106
0:3:28,34 --> 0:3:32,14
allowing the audience to release aggression within a safe boundary.

107
0:3:32,14 --> 0:3:33,26
and making others look foolish

108
0:3:33,26 --> 0:3:34,18
Xiaochao's account

109
0:3:34,18 --> 0:3:36,6
the third keyword is expectation fulfillment

110
0:3:36,6 --> 0:3:39,42
many online opinions suggest that Xiaochao has run out of new ideas

111
0:3:39,42 --> 0:3:40,78
but let's consider this

112
0:3:40,78 --> 0:3:43,16
if a team can achieve great results

113
0:3:43,16 --> 0:3:44,8
results widely recognized as excellent

114
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:46,54
and they also have well-known issues

115
0:3:46,54 --> 0:3:48,98
and these issues have persisted for a long time

116
0:3:48,98 --> 0:3:50,14
That's quite peculiar.

117
0:3:50,14 --> 0:3:52,46
It's likely that the issue isn't central.

118
0:3:52,46 --> 0:3:53,1
or rather,

119
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:54,26
the problem itself

120
0:3:54,26 --> 0:3:56,52
is the solution to a more significant question.

121
0:3:56,52 --> 0:3:57,26
In my view,

122
0:3:57,26 --> 0:3:59,2
Dean Chen doesn't lack for work,

123
0:3:59,2 --> 0:4:1,22
and this might just be their channel's unique way of operating.

124
0:4:1,22 --> 0:4:2,78
But why are the viewers tuning in for Xiao Chao?

125
0:4:2,78 --> 0:4:5,32
I think this principle is very similar to the show 'A Chinese Odyssey',

126
0:4:5,32 --> 0:4:6,22
'The Big Bang Theory',

127
0:4:6,22 --> 0:4:7,0
'2 Broke Girls',

128
0:4:7,0 --> 0:4:8,48
and even 'How I Met Your Mother',

129
0:4:8,48 --> 0:4:11,94
as well as the value that Guo Degang and Yu Qian's crosstalk can bring to the audience.

130
0:4:11,94 --> 0:4:14,98
It's all about the relationships between the characters that the audience watches,

131
0:4:14,98 --> 0:4:16,82
which brings a sense of warmth,

132
0:4:16,82 --> 0:4:18,519
and a feeling of closeness,

133
0:4:18,519 --> 0:4:20,159
along with that unique sense of companionship.

134
0:4:20,159 --> 0:4:21,439
For instance, I have a friend in my life

135
0:4:21,439 --> 0:4:23,79
who has watched 'A Love of Dashing Scholars' dozens of times

136
0:4:23,79 --> 0:4:24,639
and still watches it every day

137
0:4:24,639 --> 0:4:26,62
watching an episode of 'A Love of Dashing Scholars' after work

138
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:29,44
helps him relax and feel at ease

139
0:4:29,44 --> 0:4:31,48
Dean Xiao Qiao also has this ability

140
0:4:31,48 --> 0:4:34,0
no matter how fantastical the outside world gets

141
0:4:34,0 --> 0:4:36,74
these few people remain carefree and lighthearted

142
0:4:36,74 --> 0:4:37,52
full of laughter and joy

143
0:4:37,52 --> 0:4:38,78
The relationship is still as strong.

144
0:4:38,78 --> 0:4:39,92
Then that’s enough.

145
0:4:39,92 --> 0:4:42,1
This is the very unique model of President Xiao Qiao.

146
0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:46,2
It’s the immense emotional value derived from consistently meeting expectations.

147
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:48,22
That’s the real secret behind President Xiao Chao’s account.

148
0:4:48,22 --> 0:4:48,82
Good summary.

149
0:4:48,82 --> 0:4:49,58
One last point.

150
0:4:49,58 --> 0:4:51,46
President Xiao Chao is truly unique.

151
0:4:51,46 --> 0:4:53,6
You won’t find a second like this across the entire Chinese internet.

152
0:4:53,6 --> 0:4:54,34
However, in my view

153
0:4:54,34 --> 0:4:56,14
their account does have two underlying concerns

154
0:4:56,14 --> 0:4:56,98
What's the first one?

155
0:4:56,98 --> 0:4:58,94
The first is the overly stable expectations of their audience

156
0:4:58,94 --> 0:5:0,34
which might become a shackle for them

157
0:5:0,34 --> 0:5:2,1
making it hard for their content to evolve rapidly

158
0:5:2,1 --> 0:5:2,86
the burden is heavy

159
0:5:2,86 --> 0:5:4,77
although even if they don't evolve

160
0:5:4,77 --> 0:5:6,55
their loyal fans will still find satisfaction

161
0:5:6,55 --> 0:5:9,7
But after a content cycle has passed,

162
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:10,47
their IP might become outdated,

163
0:5:10,47 --> 0:5:12,21
making it hard for new audiences to relate and resonate,

164
0:5:12,21 --> 0:5:14,1
and the entire IP portfolio will enter a decline phase.

165
0:5:14,1 --> 0:5:16,1
This places very high demands on them,

166
0:5:16,1 --> 0:5:18,48
requiring them to constantly strive for change in the struggle.

167
0:5:18,48 --> 0:5:18,98
The second point is,

168
0:5:18,98 --> 0:5:20,0
their model,

169
0:5:20,0 --> 0:5:23,26
the management costs will be significantly higher than those of other self-media teams.

170
0:5:23,26 --> 0:5:25,9
You want your employees to feel like brothers

171
0:5:25,9 --> 0:5:27,12
and family members, right?

172
0:5:27,12 --> 0:5:28,96
Firstly, the distribution of benefits has to be different, doesn't it?

173
0:5:28,96 --> 0:5:31,1
In short, you have to share more of the profits.

174
0:5:31,1 --> 0:5:32,58
When they're all brothers,

175
0:5:32,58 --> 0:5:33,38
all family,

176
0:5:33,38 --> 0:5:36,14
can you still be fair in rewarding and punishing?

177
0:5:36,14 --> 0:5:37,58
Can you still ensure efficient execution?

178
0:5:37,58 --> 0:5:38,82
Can you still be impartial?

179
0:5:38,82 --> 0:5:40,66
You and the employees are starting to become friends.

180
0:5:40,66 --> 0:5:44,12
Can Ma Haoning still maintain his authority as the boss?

181
0:5:44,12 --> 0:5:46,42
Finally, if anyone has an issue,

182
0:5:46,42 --> 0:5:48,68
and there's a conflict with this employee,

183
0:5:48,68 --> 0:5:50,4
Xiao Qiao will also face,

184
0:5:50,4 --> 0:5:52,14
a much larger public opinion problem than other self-media teams.

185
0:5:52,14 --> 0:5:54,36
Other teams can simply fire the person,

186
0:5:54,36 --> 0:5:55,92
and the team will continue to function as usual.

187
0:5:55,92 --> 0:5:58,37
But for Xiao Qiao, that's not an option.

188
0:5:58,37 --> 0:6:1,84
This is a significant test of Mahaining's management skills

189
0:6:1,84 --> 0:6:3,6
and the mental fortitude of a few key team members

190
0:6:3,6 --> 0:6:4,3
So far

191
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:5,38
despite various issues

192
0:6:5,38 --> 0:6:6,48
overall

193
0:6:6,48 --> 0:6:7,52
the Xiaochengxuzhang account

194
0:6:7,52 --> 0:6:10,2
has maintained its core value and the trust of its audience

195
0:6:10,2 --> 0:6:12,12
In my view, Mahaining is a very thoughtful

196
0:6:12,12 --> 0:6:15,65
and highly capable content creator and team leader

197
0:6:16,86 --> 0:6:17,74
The wacky Nestlé

198
0:6:17,74 --> 0:6:19,68
The first keyword is expectation violation

199
0:6:19,68 --> 0:6:21,58
If Dean Xiao Chen represents expectation fulfillment

200
0:6:21,58 --> 0:6:23,84
then Nestlé is the epitome of expectation violation

201
0:6:23,84 --> 0:6:27,1
Almost every joke from Nestlé tries to break away from the audience's expectations

202
0:6:27,1 --> 0:6:29,82
Nestlé's expectation violation has a few additional characteristics

203
0:6:29,82 --> 0:6:32,85
The first is that the expectation itself is not very mainstream

204
0:6:32,85 --> 0:6:34,69
The expectation is either a joke

205
0:6:34,69 --> 0:6:37,33
or it comes from otaku culture or other cultural products

206
0:6:37,33 --> 0:6:39,45
Even the expectation he defies

207
0:6:39,45 --> 0:6:42,1
is itself a joke that defies some expectation

208
0:6:42,1 --> 0:6:44,81
So at times it creates a double-reversal of expectations

209
0:6:44,81 --> 0:6:45,99
This is a double-edged sword

210
0:6:45,99 --> 0:6:47,43
Audiences who are too immersed in reality

211
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:49,13
If they miss his original expectation

212
0:6:49,13 --> 0:6:51,27
They won’t get the comedic effect of the reversed expectation

213
0:6:51,27 --> 0:6:52,4
And they will find it confusing

214
0:6:52,4 --> 0:6:54,8
But those who like it will feel a sense of kinship

215
0:6:54,8 --> 0:6:55,68
Finding the feeling of home

216
0:6:55,68 --> 0:6:56,72
Finding the sense of belonging

217
0:6:56,72 --> 0:6:57,8
So the second feature is

218
0:6:57,8 --> 0:7:1,28
He uses almost every conceivable form to achieve this

219
0:7:1,28 --> 0:7:1,88
Rather than go against it

220
0:7:1,88 --> 0:7:4,0
It’s a kaleidoscope of technical innovations

221
0:7:4,0 --> 0:7:6,28
For instance, he clearly draws inspiration from manzai, right

222
0:7:6,28 --> 0:7:9,28
Using a character or a voice-over to serve as the tsukkomi

223
0:7:9,28 --> 0:7:10,56
Yes, it’s a very common approach

224
0:7:10,56 --> 0:7:11,8
We can see in his videos

225
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:15,63
As we just saw, scenes from a Japanese comedy duo performance and a talk show

226
0:7:15,63 --> 0:7:16,89
comedy, even short skits

227
0:7:16,89 --> 0:7:18,11
a variety of expressive styles

228
0:7:18,11 --> 0:7:18,91
and creative ideas

229
0:7:18,91 --> 0:7:19,99
What's the third characteristic?

230
0:7:19,99 --> 0:7:21,86
It's the incredibly fast pace of Nestlé's content

231
0:7:21,86 --> 0:7:22,68
so fast it's almost shocking

232
0:7:22,68 --> 0:7:24,24
This speed has two aspects

233
0:7:24,24 --> 0:7:25,48
On one hand, the density of jokes is high.

234
0:7:25,48 --> 0:7:28,32
I counted the number of videos Nestlé has released in the last 11 periods.

235
0:7:28,32 --> 0:7:31,16
His total video duration is 3,532 seconds.

236
0:7:31,16 --> 0:7:32,68
with a total of 235 jokes.

237
0:7:32,68 --> 0:7:33,96
That's an average of one joke every 15 seconds.

238
0:7:33,96 --> 0:7:35,28
This is a remarkably high frequency.

239
0:7:35,28 --> 0:7:36,3
On the other hand, the pace is fast.

240
0:7:36,3 --> 0:7:37,52
The efficiency of the jokes is high.

241
0:7:37,52 --> 0:7:40,73
From setting up expectations or laying the groundwork to the punchline.

242
0:7:40,73 --> 0:7:42,24
Or this expectation is violated

243
0:7:42,24 --> 0:7:43,68
Generally around five seconds

244
0:7:43,68 --> 0:7:44,38
Within five seconds

245
0:7:44,38 --> 0:7:45,82
Rarely exceeds eight seconds

246
0:7:45,82 --> 0:7:48,48
Nestlé also uses an extremely fast speaking rate and tone

247
0:7:48,48 --> 0:7:49,56
A different editing approach

248
0:7:49,56 --> 0:7:50,8
So it uses a very fast pace

249
0:7:50,8 --> 0:7:52,52
Creating a brainstorming effect

250
0:7:52,52 --> 0:7:54,52
Almost putting the audience into a state of flow

251
0:7:54,52 --> 0:7:56,16
Enjoy an overwhelming viewing experience

252
0:7:56,16 --> 0:7:58,4
Audiences who fall for this will get an extra thrill

253
0:7:58,4 --> 0:7:59,52
What's the fourth feature?

254
0:7:59,52 --> 0:8:1,56
Nestlé often employs some sophisticated tactics

255
0:8:1,56 --> 0:8:2,44
For instance, running gags

256
0:8:2,44 --> 0:8:3,6
Or breaking the fourth wall

257
0:8:3,6 --> 0:8:4,2
Running gags

258
0:8:4,2 --> 0:8:6,2
For example, the genuine emotion displayed at the old funeral

259
0:8:6,2 --> 0:8:9,4
In this episode, the thought of Jingwei not being able to reach the keepsakes on the top shelf

260
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:9,7
He just wanted to laugh

261
0:8:9,7 --> 0:8:12,3
Then he thought about Jingwei roasting in the fire

262
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:12,69
He wanted to laugh again

263
0:8:12,69 --> 0:8:14,35
Then he imagined Jingwei hitting the dog

264
0:8:14,35 --> 0:8:14,99
He felt like laughing once more

265
0:8:14,99 --> 0:8:15,75
In just 20 seconds

266
0:8:15,75 --> 0:8:17,11
These three jokes were linked together

267
0:8:17,11 --> 0:8:17,94
Forming a chain of jokes

268
0:8:17,94 --> 0:8:19,9
Breaking the fourth wall was also used quite frequently

269
0:8:19,9 --> 0:8:20,66
I need to jump more

270
0:8:20,66 --> 0:8:21,54
What are you talking about?

271
0:8:21,54 --> 0:8:22,61
How can we vote if this doesn't change?

272
0:8:22,61 --> 0:8:23,85
I won 5 million in the lottery

273
0:8:23,85 --> 0:8:24,61
What are you saying?

274
0:8:24,61 --> 0:8:25,89
The girl you like confessed to me

275
0:8:25,89 --> 0:8:27,21
What's the point of this certificate?

276
0:8:27,21 --> 0:8:28,62
Stop

277
0:8:30,4 --> 0:8:31,4
Many people caught us

278
0:8:31,4 --> 0:8:31,86
Who's there?

279
0:8:31,86 --> 0:8:33,4
Have the audience send danmu to catch him

280
0:8:33,4 --> 0:8:36,44
This advanced approach will keep the audience coming back for more.

281
0:8:36,44 --> 0:8:38,92
What was mentioned above are the technical features of Nestlé.

282
0:8:38,92 --> 0:8:41,0
And in the past couple of years, Nestlé has evolved even further.

283
0:8:41,0 --> 0:8:44,74
It has started to play bigger games in strategic planning.

284
0:8:44,74 --> 0:8:46,18
Creating more comprehensive surprises.

285
0:8:46,18 --> 0:8:47,92
Or simply put in a comedic way,

286
0:8:47,92 --> 0:8:50,4
He has started to double down more frequently.

287
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:52,36
This is also evident in the data statistics.

288
0:8:52,36 --> 0:8:55,9
The first half of each video in Nestlé's nearly 11 episodes combined

289
0:8:55,9 --> 0:8:57,14
there are a total of 150 jokes.

290
0:8:57,14 --> 0:8:58,3
On average, every 11.7 seconds.

291
0:8:58,3 --> 0:9:0,32
In the second half, there are a total of 94 jokes,

292
0:9:0,32 --> 0:9:1,5
on average every 18.8 seconds.

293
0:9:1,5 --> 0:9:3,8
The stark difference in these figures

294
0:9:3,8 --> 0:9:7,4
It's because many of Nestlé's videos are not properly presented in the second half.

295
0:9:7,4 --> 0:9:8,4
not just aiming for laughs.

296
0:9:8,4 --> 0:9:9,74
Instead, it’s about adding value and emotional depth

297
0:9:9,74 --> 0:9:11,8
This requires additional space to handle

298
0:9:11,8 --> 0:9:13,2
As a result, the density of jokes decreases

299
0:9:13,2 --> 0:9:15,54
For example, when trying to hit the audience's funny bone

300
0:9:15,54 --> 0:9:17,52
The revelation of the true culprit in this episode

301
0:9:17,52 --> 0:9:18,22
In the second half

302
0:9:18,22 --> 0:9:20,98
Including the lingering traces of kindness in the true culprit’s heart

303
0:9:20,98 --> 0:9:22,98
Creates two consecutive plot twists

304
0:9:22,98 --> 0:9:24,2
He must touch the audience

305
0:9:24,2 --> 0:9:26,48
The final shot by the police chief in this episode

306
0:9:26,48 --> 0:9:29,1
along with all the preceding flashbacks

307
0:9:29,1 --> 0:9:29,97
reveals to the audience

308
0:9:29,97 --> 0:9:32,15
that every joke earlier was actually a setup

309
0:9:32,15 --> 0:9:34,29
This major structural twist

310
0:9:34,29 --> 0:9:36,53
combined with a series of earlier surprises

311
0:9:36,53 --> 0:9:38,89
and the connections within smaller structures

312
0:9:38,89 --> 0:9:40,169
creates a whirlwind viewing experience

313
0:9:40,169 --> 0:9:41,489
with a lightning-fast pace at the beginning

314
0:9:41,489 --> 0:9:42,969
Dense jokes, man

315
0:9:42,969 --> 0:9:44,369
keep the audience from catching their breath

316
0:9:44,369 --> 0:9:46,52
then switch the background music to suspenseful

317
0:9:46,52 --> 0:9:47,88
triggering goosebumps

318
0:9:47,88 --> 0:9:49,72
this nested expectation subversion

319
0:9:49,72 --> 0:9:51,52
It also formed the Nestlé video.

320
0:9:51,52 --> 0:9:54,2
Compared to other funny videos, the competitive barrier

321
0:9:54,2 --> 0:9:56,8
of course, does this come at a cost?

322
0:9:56,8 --> 0:9:56,98
it certainly does

323
0:9:56,98 --> 0:10:0,2
Quqiao is a creator whose comments tend to be quite polarized.

324
0:10:0,2 --> 0:10:2,94
People you like, you'll eagerly look forward to watching their every share.

325
0:10:2,94 --> 0:10:5,12
But many people would say, 'What is this nonsense?'

326
0:10:5,12 --> 0:10:5,58
They can’t understand it

327
0:10:5,58 --> 0:10:6,72
Or find it bizarre

328
0:10:6,72 --> 0:10:8,92
Or they might be put off by some of Quqiao’s lowbrow jokes

329
0:10:8,92 --> 0:10:11,74
I’ve always thought Quqiao’s content is the best generational gap reducer

330
0:10:11,74 --> 0:10:13,9
Meaning if your internet savvy is a bit lacking

331
0:10:13,9 --> 0:10:16,5
And you’re not familiar with some of the memes and online lingo

332
0:10:16,5 --> 0:10:19,66
Those not used to the ultra-fast pace find it hard to adapt to the videos on QuChao.

333
0:10:19,66 --> 0:10:22,419
So, Nestlé is naturally a channel that is quite niche.

334
0:10:22,419 --> 0:10:24,179
Its audience is quite limited.

335
0:10:24,179 --> 0:10:25,19
He has so many followers

336
0:10:25,19 --> 0:10:26,179
it's only because he's so strong.

337
0:10:26,179 --> 0:10:29,22
This won't change unless he alters his core creative approach.

338
0:10:29,22 --> 0:10:31,2
The second keyword for Nestlé is shame.

339
0:10:31,2 --> 0:10:31,66
As we mentioned earlier,

340
0:10:31,66 --> 0:10:34,1
the later Nestlé videos aren't entirely absurdly funny, right?

341
0:10:34,1 --> 0:10:36,44
He often has deep emotional expressions in some of his videos.

342
0:10:36,44 --> 0:10:39,68
But Qu Qiao seems to have a sense of shame about this kind of emotional expression

343
0:10:39,68 --> 0:10:40,92
I think the whole team shares this feeling

344
0:10:40,92 --> 0:10:42,32
He is reluctant to directly acknowledge it

345
0:10:42,32 --> 0:10:44,82
The emotional connection between himself and the team

346
0:10:44,82 --> 0:10:47,38
He is hesitant to directly open up to the audience about his inner thoughts

347
0:10:47,38 --> 0:10:49,4
This is not an obstacle to comedy

348
0:10:49,4 --> 0:10:51,29
I think it’s actually a driving force for comedy to some extent

349
0:10:51,29 --> 0:10:54,33
And even fundamentally, the driving force behind many artistic expressions

350
0:10:54,33 --> 0:10:57,19
It's because creators can't directly use everyday language

351
0:10:57,19 --> 0:11:0,91
to express their emotions and thoughts in a conventional way

352
0:11:0,91 --> 0:11:2,99
Additionally, we can see from some public figures

353
0:11:2,99 --> 0:11:6,52
that the proportion of people in marginal situations within the Nestlé team is relatively high

354
0:11:6,52 --> 0:11:8,3
I'm not making any malicious speculations here

355
0:11:8,3 --> 0:11:10,2
but I believe their sense of shame in expressing themselves

356
0:11:10,2 --> 0:11:12,24
might originate from their developmental stages

357
0:11:12,24 --> 0:11:13,52
when they found it hard to fit into the mainstream culture

358
0:11:13,52 --> 0:11:14,12
or at school

359
0:11:14,12 --> 0:11:15,12
Being accepted by the family

360
0:11:15,12 --> 0:11:18,3
is not encouraged to express their true feelings and thoughts

361
0:11:18,3 --> 0:11:20,82
which is why they have developed this roundabout way

362
0:11:20,82 --> 0:11:23,86
of speaking the truth in a seemingly playful manner

363
0:11:23,86 --> 0:11:25,18
I want to emphasize this again

364
0:11:25,18 --> 0:11:26,4
is not a weakness of the Magpie Bridge

365
0:11:26,4 --> 0:11:29,46
On the contrary, I think this aligns perfectly with The Spirit of the Age and generational characteristics.

366
0:11:29,46 --> 0:11:32,24
Because the new generation, to some extent, shares these expressive traits

367
0:11:32,24 --> 0:11:32,96
in the postmodern era

368
0:11:32,96 --> 0:11:35,2
The most basic expressions of human emotion and values

369
0:11:35,2 --> 0:11:36,72
have been deconstructed to the point of being unrecognizable

370
0:11:36,72 --> 0:11:38,32
Some people may no longer be able to

371
0:11:38,32 --> 0:11:40,96
communicate their care for another person in a normal and smooth way

372
0:11:40,96 --> 0:11:42,56
let alone affection and reliance

373
0:11:42,56 --> 0:11:43,94
expressing such simple emotions

374
0:11:43,94 --> 0:11:45,94
can leave both themselves and the other person at a loss

375
0:11:45,94 --> 0:11:48,64
However, our human genes haven't completely changed yet

376
0:11:48,64 --> 0:11:50,26
we are still social animals

377
0:11:50,26 --> 0:11:52,18
We are actually almost the same as ancient humans.

378
0:11:52,18 --> 0:11:55,6
We still have a need for simple and beautiful connections between people.

379
0:11:55,6 --> 0:11:58,24
So defensive expression becomes a safe choice.

380
0:11:58,24 --> 0:12:0,5
This defensive expression manifests in several ways.

381
0:12:0,5 --> 0:12:2,14
For example, pulling away your own chair.

382
0:12:2,14 --> 0:12:4,62
Saying 'I was just kidding' after a serious statement.

383
0:12:4,62 --> 0:12:5,74
Or asking 'You don’t really believe that, do you?',

384
0:12:5,74 --> 0:12:7,28
to deconstruct the seriousness.

385
0:12:7,28 --> 0:12:10,2
Or using extremely exaggerated expressions.

386
0:12:10,2 --> 0:12:12,72
an exaggerated way to amplify one's emotional expression

387
0:12:12,72 --> 0:12:14,54
thus making the expression more playful

388
0:12:14,54 --> 0:12:15,92
in fact, Stephen Chow also uses this technique

389
0:12:15,92 --> 0:12:19,22
or another approach is to use aggressive language to undermine the warmth

390
0:12:19,22 --> 0:12:21,64
for example, you actually care a lot about your sick roommate

391
0:12:21,64 --> 0:12:22,58
but you might say to him

392
0:12:22,58 --> 0:12:24,36
hey, dad is here to check on his son's health

393
0:12:24,36 --> 0:12:25,62
this is a similar approach

394
0:12:25,62 --> 0:12:28,98
these three methods are frequently mixed and used by Nestlé

395
0:12:28,98 --> 0:12:30,48
I think this is also a potential reason why Gen Z feels comfortable with Nestlé.

396
0:12:30,48 --> 0:12:32,64
Even when it comes to serious emotional expressions,

397
0:12:32,64 --> 0:12:35,1
it never makes anyone feel awkward.

398
0:12:35,1 --> 0:12:37,2
There’s no sense of preaching,

399
0:12:37,2 --> 0:12:38,34
nor any emotional manipulation.

400
0:12:38,34 --> 0:12:39,28
Instead, it leaves a lingering taste that touches people’s hearts.

401
0:12:39,28 --> 0:12:41,84
Like the episode where an employee who had been with me for 10 years left.

402
0:12:41,84 --> 0:12:44,56
It’s works like this that resonate with us.

403
0:12:45,78 --> 0:12:48,8
This sense of shame is also a significant characteristic of the Nestlé account.

404
0:12:48,8 --> 0:12:51,12
The third keyword for Nestlé is continuous improvement.

405
0:12:51,12 --> 0:12:52,56
This is what I admire most about Nestlé.

406
0:12:52,56 --> 0:12:54,0
They are very ambitious in their content.

407
0:12:54,0 --> 0:12:55,109
They are incredibly courageous.

408
0:12:55,109 --> 0:12:57,689
Let's look at the Nestlé account arranged chronologically.

409
0:12:57,689 --> 0:13:0,26
You can clearly see an evolutionary curve.

410
0:13:0,26 --> 0:13:3,62
From the earliest comedic game commentary to the courtroom series.

411
0:13:3,62 --> 0:13:4,26
The Holmes series

412
0:13:4,26 --> 0:13:7,27
And then there was the Doraemon series, which later took off in popularity.

413
0:13:7,27 --> 0:13:9,49
This period is basically a collection of jokes.

414
0:13:9,49 --> 0:13:11,55
And then it transitioned into live-action series

415
0:13:11,55 --> 0:13:13,39
Starting from simple live-action skits

416
0:13:13,39 --> 0:13:15,55
Evolving all the way to the current very mature

417
0:13:15,55 --> 0:13:16,99
Very complex plot-driven films

418
0:13:16,99 --> 0:13:19,59
Nestlé can be said to innovate every year

419
0:13:19,59 --> 0:13:21,93
This is incredibly challenging

420
0:13:21,93 --> 0:13:23,59
Because when you haven't achieved success

421
0:13:23,59 --> 0:13:24,72
Persistence is the hardest part.

422
0:13:24,72 --> 0:13:26,54
But after you achieve success,

423
0:13:26,54 --> 0:13:29,32
persistence turns into the courage to change inertia,

424
0:13:29,32 --> 0:13:30,86
becoming the rarest commodity.

425
0:13:30,86 --> 0:13:32,46
Out of 100 creators,

426
0:13:32,46 --> 0:13:35,4
After Doraemon (2005) received seven million views

427
0:13:35,4 --> 0:13:38,94
at least 80 will stick to their proven formula,

428
0:13:38,94 --> 0:13:40,5
making minor adjustments here and there,

429
0:13:40,5 --> 0:13:43,68
and then launch similar new series to replicate that success.

430
0:13:43,68 --> 0:13:45,75
Rather than taking drastic risks like Nestlé

431
0:13:45,75 --> 0:13:48,62
to overhaul the foundation

432
0:13:48,62 --> 0:13:50,6
and attempt something entirely different

433
0:13:50,6 --> 0:13:52,12
80 people would likely not be able to do it

434
0:13:52,12 --> 0:13:54,42
So, this reveals a few characteristics of Nestlé

435
0:13:54,42 --> 0:13:55,38
What is the first one?

436
0:13:55,38 --> 0:13:57,5
The first is that Nestlé and its team

437
0:13:57,5 --> 0:13:59,49
possess strong learning and integration capabilities

438
0:13:59,49 --> 0:14:1,78
There have always been people questioning Nestlé's approach

439
0:14:1,78 --> 0:14:2,82
As for the imitation of Magpie Bridge

440
0:14:2,82 --> 0:14:3,58
I personally think

441
0:14:3,58 --> 0:14:5,88
if a content team can stitch together something to the level of Nestlé

442
0:14:5,88 --> 0:14:7,56
it’s not about being lazy and copying specific content

443
0:14:7,56 --> 0:14:8,72
but rather about mastering a certain format

444
0:14:8,72 --> 0:14:9,88
or a particular style

445
0:14:9,88 --> 0:14:11,92
and seamlessly integrate it into your own video

446
0:14:11,92 --> 0:14:14,79
and creating something that is highly recognizable

447
0:14:14,79 --> 0:14:16,8
a unique style of their own

448
0:14:16,8 --> 0:14:18,14
So, what's the issue with this so-called imitation?

449
0:14:18,14 --> 0:14:20,84
Or how much content can people approach with this attitude?

450
0:14:20,84 --> 0:14:22,48
Regarding the content they produce?

451
0:14:22,48 --> 0:14:25,68
Secondly, Nestlé has a strong belief in its content capabilities and differentiation.

452
0:14:25,68 --> 0:14:27,4
They must have a robust confidence.

453
0:14:27,4 --> 0:14:29,5
They can trust that even when changing formats,

454
0:14:29,5 --> 0:14:31,24
they can still come up with interesting ideas,

455
0:14:31,24 --> 0:14:32,44
and create engaging content.

456
0:14:32,44 --> 0:14:35,54
They also have confidence in the connection between themselves and their audience.

457
0:14:35,54 --> 0:14:38,6
What Qiao grasps is not a specific creative formula

458
0:14:38,6 --> 0:14:41,42
but an understanding of the core and essence of comedy

459
0:14:41,42 --> 0:14:43,34
This allows him to switch formats

460
0:14:43,34 --> 0:14:47,0
Moreover, he has a strong ambition and passion for creation

461
0:14:47,0 --> 0:14:48,6
Don't think this is just a common occurrence

462
0:14:48,6 --> 0:14:51,4
Creating content can be extremely tiring

463
0:14:51,4 --> 0:14:53,28
After creators make money

464
0:14:53,28 --> 0:14:55,52
it's not common for them to remain focused on the content

465
0:14:55,52 --> 0:14:56,2
You could say

466
0:14:56,2 --> 0:14:58,8
Nestle is the most fitting for the cinematic style

467
0:14:58,8 --> 0:15:0,38
a Bilibili creator with the slogan 'endless progress'

468
0:15:0,38 --> 0:15:3,96
I hope he can continue to maintain such abundant creative energy

469
0:15:5,24 --> 0:15:7,32
What's the first keyword for Lux?

470
0:15:7,32 --> 0:15:8,16
It's information intermediary

471
0:15:8,16 --> 0:15:10,8
They all say Lux is an UPloader from the Varied Zone.

472
0:15:10,8 --> 0:15:12,14
Have you ever thought about why he can achieve this?

473
0:15:12,14 --> 0:15:13,44
Let's take a look at Lux's topic selection

474
0:15:13,44 --> 0:15:14,12
and it will become clear

475
0:15:14,12 --> 0:15:16,2
90% of the topics can be categorized into three types.

476
0:15:16,2 --> 0:15:17,62
The first type is cross-domain experiences.

477
0:15:17,62 --> 0:15:19,1
It involves

478
0:15:19,1 --> 0:15:21,6
personally exploring a new field, a cross-domain experience.

479
0:15:21,6 --> 0:15:22,1
For example, auctions, right?

480
0:15:22,1 --> 0:15:23,54
There are also instances where he brings others into a new domain,

481
0:15:23,54 --> 0:15:25,9
like frequently organizing various gatherings,

482
0:15:25,9 --> 0:15:26,91
getting two people from completely different backgrounds to chat,

483
0:15:26,91 --> 0:15:29,21
or having an esports commentator guess prices, and so on.

484
0:15:29,21 --> 0:15:30,3
These all fall under the category of crossover.

485
0:15:30,3 --> 0:15:32,34
The second category is product reviews and recommendations

486
0:15:32,34 --> 0:15:33,32
I won't elaborate on this further.

487
0:15:33,32 --> 0:15:33,92
Everyone understands this.

488
0:15:33,92 --> 0:15:35,38
The third category is crowdfunding.

489
0:15:35,38 --> 0:15:39,4
The content involves Lux soliciting certain opinions from the audience.

490
0:15:39,4 --> 0:15:40,2
Or certain works.

491
0:15:40,2 --> 0:15:43,16
The camera drift project from a while back was a form of crowdfunding.

492
0:15:43,16 --> 0:15:44,88
What do these three categories have in common?

493
0:15:44,88 --> 0:15:47,76
Laks actually plays the role of an intermediary.

494
0:15:47,76 --> 0:15:50,64
He serves as a middleman for the audience to explore a larger world.

495
0:15:50,64 --> 0:15:51,84
Let's not talk about cross-border and crowdfunding.

496
0:15:51,84 --> 0:15:53,96
The intermediary aspect is quite prominent, right?

497
0:15:53,96 --> 0:15:55,84
It's purely about broadening the audience's horizons.

498
0:15:55,84 --> 0:15:58,32
To understand another side of a different world.

499
0:15:58,32 --> 0:15:59,95
Even when it comes to reviews,

500
0:15:59,95 --> 0:16:1,99
Laks's reviews are quite different from traditional tech

501
0:16:1,99 --> 0:16:3,3
and digital channels.

502
0:16:3,3 --> 0:16:4,52
In its product review video,

503
0:16:4,52 --> 0:16:7,42
the segment showcasing product features can take up to seventy to eighty percent

504
0:16:7,42 --> 0:16:9,4
while the traditional review method

505
0:16:9,4 --> 0:16:11,8
spends relatively less time on explanations and opinions

506
0:16:11,8 --> 0:16:13,64
Lux, who willingly acts as an information intermediary

507
0:16:13,64 --> 0:16:14,8
What are the advantages of this?

508
0:16:14,8 --> 0:16:16,1
Lux rarely makes mistakes

509
0:16:16,1 --> 0:16:17,96
he is someone who, in private, is known for his sharp judgment

510
0:16:17,96 --> 0:16:18,76
which is quite incisive

511
0:16:18,76 --> 0:16:20,6
I personally think his judgment is very sharp.

512
0:16:20,6 --> 0:16:21,98
His opinions and inclinations are very clear.

513
0:16:21,98 --> 0:16:23,52
He is a person with a strong sense of independence.

514
0:16:23,52 --> 0:16:25,5
So, it's not that he lacks ideas.

515
0:16:25,5 --> 0:16:26,2
Or has no opinions.

516
0:16:26,2 --> 0:16:27,38
But rather, he actively suppresses them.

517
0:16:27,38 --> 0:16:29,12
He gives up a lot of personal expression.

518
0:16:29,12 --> 0:16:30,22
What does he gain from this?

519
0:16:30,22 --> 0:16:31,62
He gains the audience's trust in him.

520
0:16:31,62 --> 0:16:33,78
Lower professional standards and expectations

521
0:16:33,78 --> 0:16:35,64
also grant greater freedom in topic selection

522
0:16:35,64 --> 0:16:38,72
in the current harsh environment of the Chinese internet

523
0:16:38,72 --> 0:16:41,6
it manages to span across numerous fields in content creation

524
0:16:41,6 --> 0:16:43,62
due to its role as an information intermediary

525
0:16:43,62 --> 0:16:45,98
significantly expanding Lux's range of topics

526
0:16:45,98 --> 0:16:47,46
So, what is the cost of this approach?

527
0:16:47,46 --> 0:16:48,42
There are at least two costs

528
0:16:48,42 --> 0:16:51,22
The first cost is that the functional aspect of the Lux channel is relatively weak

529
0:16:51,22 --> 0:16:52,28
The sense of gain is somewhat vague

530
0:16:52,28 --> 0:16:54,28
This will to some extent limit his fan growth rate

531
0:16:54,28 --> 0:16:56,4
Another cost is reduced personal expression

532
0:16:56,4 --> 0:16:57,94
which can make the IP less distinctive

533
0:16:57,94 --> 0:16:58,96
If it wasn't Lux

534
0:16:58,96 --> 0:16:59,74
It's other UPloaders

535
0:16:59,74 --> 0:17:1,38
they might fall into the trap of frequent hits

536
0:17:1,38 --> 0:17:3,4
but people wouldn't remember who the creator is

537
0:17:3,4 --> 0:17:4,54
but Lux is incredibly talented

538
0:17:4,54 --> 0:17:6,68
He solved the problem in various other ways.

539
0:17:6,68 --> 0:17:7,46
We'll talk about that later.

540
0:17:7,46 --> 0:17:7,88
Lux

541
0:17:7,88 --> 0:17:10,8
The second keyword is project management guru.

542
0:17:10,8 --> 0:17:11,52
Lux is a top-notch professional.

543
0:17:11,52 --> 0:17:13,5
He's one of the strongest project executors I've ever seen.

544
0:17:13,5 --> 0:17:15,8
And Lux isn't the kind of project manager who comes from an academic background.

545
0:17:15,8 --> 0:17:18,16
He doesn't turn processes into rigid SOPs.

546
0:17:18,16 --> 0:17:20,44
He doesn't write detailed contingency plans for every possible scenario.

547
0:17:20,44 --> 0:17:21,0
He doesn't do it that way.

548
0:17:21,0 --> 0:17:23,42
Lux will be very pragmatic in project execution

549
0:17:23,42 --> 0:17:24,48
Even a bit unconventional.

550
0:17:24,48 --> 0:17:26,38
He excels at simplifying complex matters.

551
0:17:26,38 --> 0:17:27,82
He sets the framework.

552
0:17:27,82 --> 0:17:28,86
Figures out the core issues.

553
0:17:28,86 --> 0:17:29,66
Once he's confident.

554
0:17:29,66 --> 0:17:30,7
He moves forward decisively.

555
0:17:30,7 --> 0:17:33,14
Relying on experience and intuition to make adjustments.

556
0:17:33,14 --> 0:17:33,9
It's incredibly flexible

557
0:17:33,9 --> 0:17:34,6
It's highly efficient

558
0:17:34,6 --> 0:17:35,0
Additionally

559
0:17:35,0 --> 0:17:36,96
Lux is also a creator with a very well-rounded skill set

560
0:17:36,96 --> 0:17:38,24
Don't think this is common

561
0:17:38,24 --> 0:17:39,38
I'm here to tell you responsibly

562
0:17:39,38 --> 0:17:40,76
Most content creators

563
0:17:40,76 --> 0:17:42,6
often have significant strengths in certain areas but not others

564
0:17:42,6 --> 0:17:46,1
People usually find complementary partners through group conversations

565
0:17:46,1 --> 0:17:47,4
to address one's own skill gaps

566
0:17:47,4 --> 0:17:49,72
Lux can almost single-handedly

567
0:17:49,72 --> 0:17:51,66
handle very complex projects

568
0:17:51,66 --> 0:17:52,9
Nailing the entire video process

569
0:17:52,9 --> 0:17:53,66
which is really impressive

570
0:17:53,66 --> 0:17:55,5
In his video project

571
0:17:55,5 --> 0:17:57,18
he not only needs to plan and write content

572
0:17:57,18 --> 0:17:58,38
but also has the skills for editing and post-production

573
0:17:58,38 --> 0:17:59,78
and he also needs to excel in interpersonal communication

574
0:17:59,78 --> 0:18:1,18
Multithreaded time management

575
0:18:1,18 --> 0:18:1,88
Outsourcing management

576
0:18:1,88 --> 0:18:2,56
Monitoring progress

577
0:18:2,56 --> 0:18:3,5
Adaptive decision-making

578
0:18:3,5 --> 0:18:4,7
Including resource allocation

579
0:18:4,7 --> 0:18:7,7
And even managing one's own emotions, all require strong skills

580
0:18:7,7 --> 0:18:9,1
To handle all those tasks

581
0:18:9,1 --> 0:18:11,34
I think the camera drift project is a great example

582
0:18:11,34 --> 0:18:13,38
Of project management and advancement capabilities

583
0:18:13,38 --> 0:18:14,42
It's a significant achievement

584
0:18:14,42 --> 0:18:16,32
This doesn't seem as complicated as it might look

585
0:18:16,32 --> 0:18:17,8
That means the camera travels around the world, right?

586
0:18:17,8 --> 0:18:19,2
But in reality, it's incredibly challenging

587
0:18:19,2 --> 0:18:19,88
Just imagine

588
0:18:19,88 --> 0:18:21,72
You need to contact the candidates

589
0:18:21,72 --> 0:18:22,64
You need to screen them

590
0:18:22,64 --> 0:18:24,24
You need to keep track of the progress over a year

591
0:18:24,24 --> 0:18:25,68
constantly diverting your attention to monitor it

592
0:18:25,68 --> 0:18:27,88
Conditions and policies vary from country to country.

593
0:18:27,88 --> 0:18:29,76
He often has to handle emergencies as well.

594
0:18:29,76 --> 0:18:31,4
For instance, logistics-related issues.

595
0:18:31,4 --> 0:18:33,9
And in the end, he managed to land the video smoothly.

596
0:18:33,9 --> 0:18:35,6
Creating a hit.

597
0:18:35,6 --> 0:18:37,36
Moreover, he can also organize

598
0:18:37,36 --> 0:18:38,88
a medium-sized offline exhibition.

599
0:18:38,88 --> 0:18:40,26
And it receives a positive response.

600
0:18:40,26 --> 0:18:42,56
This demonstrates his exceptional overall capabilities.

601
0:18:42,56 --> 0:18:45,56
I can only say that these talents bring such powerful project management and execution.

602
0:18:45,56 --> 0:18:47,68
They also bring an implicit additional benefit.

603
0:18:47,68 --> 0:18:49,98
I mentioned the issues with the IPG points, right?

604
0:18:49,98 --> 0:18:52,52
Its topic selection covers such a wide range.

605
0:18:52,52 --> 0:18:55,36
Generally speaking, IPD memory points tend to decline.

606
0:18:55,36 --> 0:18:57,78
But Lux can make everyone remember her firmly.

607
0:18:57,78 --> 0:18:58,6
What does she rely on?

608
0:18:58,6 --> 0:19:1,62
On the surface, it's the sunglasses and that lazy, laid-back tone, right?

609
0:19:1,62 --> 0:19:2,46
This contribution is significant.

610
0:19:2,46 --> 0:19:3,3
It's his icon

611
0:19:3,3 --> 0:19:5,38
But I think the more fundamental reason is

612
0:19:5,38 --> 0:19:7,44
His exceptional project management skills

613
0:19:7,44 --> 0:19:10,66
Maintaining consistency across Lax's various video projects is excellent.

614
0:19:10,66 --> 0:19:12,5
He creates such a variety of different videos

615
0:19:12,5 --> 0:19:14,42
You can randomly open Lux's third or fourth video.

616
0:19:14,42 --> 0:19:15,7
Even if the topics seem scattered

617
0:19:15,7 --> 0:19:16,26
All over the place

618
0:19:16,26 --> 0:19:16,74
Covering everything

619
0:19:16,74 --> 0:19:19,38
But you can see a very distinct

620
0:19:19,38 --> 0:19:20,74
The vibe in Lux's video

621
0:19:20,74 --> 0:19:22,6
in the way he speaks

622
0:19:22,6 --> 0:19:23,7
He believes in the editing style of the video.

623
0:19:23,7 --> 0:19:25,54
and his distinctive aesthetic

624
0:19:25,54 --> 0:19:26,51
In my view

625
0:19:26,51 --> 0:19:29,75
The consistency in videos brought about by this robust project management capability

626
0:19:29,75 --> 0:19:32,9
is the true source of his IP's memorable points

627
0:19:32,9 --> 0:19:34,31
The third keyword for Lux is audience filtering

628
0:19:34,31 --> 0:19:36,3
Lux's channel covers a wide range of topics

629
0:19:36,3 --> 0:19:37,5
and has a great aesthetic tone

630
0:19:37,5 --> 0:19:40,8
which brings him a significant added value in terms of audience

631
0:19:40,8 --> 0:19:44,2
attracting a group of highly potential middle-class audience

632
0:19:44,2 --> 0:19:45,22
with strong inclusiveness and curiosity

633
0:19:45,22 --> 0:19:46,98
which is very, very hard to achieve

634
0:19:46,98 --> 0:19:48,97
It's difficult for Lux to pull this off

635
0:19:48,97 --> 0:19:51,87
In fact, we could say it's almost a miracle that Lux has managed to do this

636
0:19:51,87 --> 0:19:53,65
This is the true wealth of Lux's account

637
0:19:53,65 --> 0:19:55,74
and an important part of his commercial value

638
0:19:55,74 --> 0:19:57,42
And the reason he can achieve this

639
0:19:57,42 --> 0:19:58,5
is not some mysticism

640
0:19:58,5 --> 0:19:59,36
nor is it just luck

641
0:19:59,36 --> 0:20:0,2
Think about it

642
0:20:0,2 --> 0:20:1,6
It makes perfect sense

643
0:20:1,6 --> 0:20:3,94
Lux himself is very open to new things, right?

644
0:20:3,94 --> 0:20:6,69
He approaches various things with an open attitude

645
0:20:6,69 --> 0:20:8,45
and it's clear that his consumption level is quite high

646
0:20:8,45 --> 0:20:11,72
So, those who are always critical of everything

647
0:20:11,72 --> 0:20:13,88
extremely conservative and critical of high premiums

648
0:20:13,88 --> 0:20:15,22
It's unlikely that you would pay much attention to him

649
0:20:15,22 --> 0:20:17,98
Instead, he attracts people with good purchasing power

650
0:20:17,98 --> 0:20:18,54
curiosity

651
0:20:18,54 --> 0:20:19,38
and young adults

652
0:20:19,38 --> 0:20:19,9
This

653
0:20:19,9 --> 0:20:22,14
is a natural outcome of his content production methods and channel positioning

654
0:20:22,14 --> 0:20:23,46
which helps him filter out a high-potential audience

655
0:20:23,46 --> 0:20:26,42
Alright, three people per episode

656
0:20:27,12 --> 0:20:29,24
three sentences each

657
0:20:29,24 --> 0:20:29,92
You might have picked up on the point of my video

658
0:20:29,92 --> 0:20:32,4
You might have figured out the point of my video by now.

659
0:20:32,4 --> 0:20:34,36
I'm not trying to praise or criticize any UPloader

660
0:20:34,36 --> 0:20:36,84
Every successful self-media person isn't just lucky

661
0:20:36,84 --> 0:20:39,1
I think by 2025, the video industry

662
0:20:39,1 --> 0:20:41,96
Actually, I think the video industry will continue to thrive until 2025.

663
0:20:41,96 --> 0:20:43,38
Accounts that might seem ordinary to you

664
0:20:43,38 --> 0:20:45,7
are actually quite strategic in the industry

665
0:20:45,7 --> 0:20:47,58
Successful self-media people must have some talent

666
0:20:47,58 --> 0:20:50,88
and personality traits

667
0:20:50,88 --> 0:20:51,2
that suit this industry

668
0:20:51,2 --> 0:20:52,62
and they must have made some right moves

669
0:20:52,62 --> 0:20:54,66
There were some key decisions

670
0:20:54,66 --> 0:20:55,7
that they got right

671
0:20:55,7 --> 0:20:56,22
These characteristics and decisions form their competitive edge

672
0:20:56,22 --> 0:20:59,14
and the core identity of their accounts

673
0:20:59,14 --> 0:21:1,94
But they also come at a cost

674
0:21:1,94 --> 0:21:4,4
and can become constraints

675
0:21:4,4 --> 0:21:5,18
The self-media business is so complex with so many variables

676
0:21:5,18 --> 0:21:7,62
that there are indeed some objectively wrong choices

677
0:21:7,62 --> 0:21:9,98
but there's rarely a single best solution

678
0:21:9,98 --> 0:21:13,38
Everyone is figuring it out as they go

679
0:21:13,38 --> 0:21:15,3
after much deliberation

680
0:21:15,3 --> 0:21:16,56
So for this series

681
0:21:16,56 --> 0:21:17,4
if you want to see which accounts I'll analyze next

682
0:21:17,4 --> 0:21:20,24
feel free to leave me a comment

683
0:21:20,24 --> 0:21:21,4
and suggest the next account to be analyzed

684
0:21:21,4 --> 0:21:24,28
Then select the BILIBILI UP100 breakdown that follows.

685
0:21:24,28 --> 0:21:25,72
Of course, there's also the possibility that it might not be part of the BILIBILI UP100.

686
0:21:25,72 --> 0:21:27,24
and my own interests to decide

687
0:21:27,24 --> 0:21:28,94
which accounts to analyze next

688
0:21:28,94 --> 0:21:31,38
Finally, a quick shoutout using basic slow motion

689
0:21:31,38 --> 0:21:34,94
Alright

690
0:21:46,22 --> 0:21:46,7
That's it for this episode

691
0:21:46,7 --> 0:21:47,74
I'm Lao Jiang

692
0:21:47,74 --> 0:21:48,24
an UP main who likes to think deeply about things

693
0:21:48,24 --> 0:21:49,22
and share my thoughts

694
0:21:49,22 --> 0:21:50,5
UPloaders who enjoy sharing their thoughts

695
0:21:50,5 --> 0:21:52,38
and make sense

696
0:21:52,38 --> 0:21:52,94
please give me a follow

697
0:21:52,94 --> 0:21:54,18
Welcome to follow me

698
0:21:54,18 --> 0:21:56,8
And let's triple-combo if we're fated to meet.

699
0:21:56,8 --> 0:21:56,82
See you next time
