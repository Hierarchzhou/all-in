1
0:0:18,6 --> 0:0:19,0
Friends,

2
0:0:19,0 --> 0:0:20,86
I'm currently in Zhengzhou, Henan Province.

3
0:0:20,86 --> 0:0:23,45
This is a place called Only Henan Fantasy City.

4
0:0:23,45 --> 0:0:26,5
It's said to be a well-designed scenic area.

5
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:28,25
There are several well-organized performances inside.

6
0:0:28,25 --> 0:0:29,17
I'm here to participate in

7
0:0:29,17 --> 0:0:30,61
an event called Travel Transformation over the next few days.

8
0:0:30,61 --> 0:0:33,57
During the day, we'll be experiencing what the park has to offer.

9
0:0:33,57 --> 0:0:34,89
All sorts of attractions within the scenic area.

10
0:0:34,89 --> 0:0:36,43
It's said that tonight

11
0:0:36,43 --> 0:0:39,59
there will be a debate related to the daytime activities

12
0:0:39,59 --> 0:0:40,79
but I have no idea what it’s about

13
0:0:40,79 --> 0:0:43,1
I find this format quite novel

14
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:44,88
so I’ll check in first

15
0:0:44,88 --> 0:0:47,0
and then start this journey

16
0:0:53,58 --> 0:0:55,82
today we’ll tour all the attractions

17
0:0:55,82 --> 0:0:58,5
we’ve arrived at the Only Henan Fantasy City Theater

18
0:0:58,5 --> 0:1:3,33
and the staff just told me that this area is 100 acres

19
0:1:3,33 --> 0:1:4,49
They really grow grain

20
0:1:4,49 --> 0:1:7,13
Because Henan is one of the cradles of civilization

21
0:1:7,13 --> 0:1:10,61
It's this wheat and sorghum that have nurtured our Chinese civilization

22
0:1:10,61 --> 0:1:13,36
So now, this season should be for wheat

23
0:1:13,36 --> 0:1:16,4
And today, we'll be at this grand venue

24
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:17,28
To watch all kinds of performances

25
0:1:17,28 --> 0:1:19,2
Let's go and see today

26
0:1:23,38 --> 0:1:30,28
Great, awesome

27
0:1:31,48 --> 0:1:33,12
His hand

28
0:1:34,56 --> 0:1:36,56
Bling bling

29
0:1:36,56 --> 0:1:37,6
Spring

30
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:41,669
That feels so good

31
0:1:42,889 --> 0:1:47,42
So, it's recommended that people don't sit in the first row

32
0:1:47,42 --> 0:1:50,6
Then, sitting further back can help you avoid these issues

33
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:51,66
It happens

34
0:1:53,0 --> 0:1:54,84
That's the self-blaming guy

35
0:1:54,84 --> 0:1:56,56
I have a great older brother

36
0:1:56,56 --> 0:1:58,36
You're messing with me on this

37
0:1:58,36 --> 0:1:59,28
Did you get it working?

38
0:1:59,28 --> 0:2:0,6
Let's do it this way.

39
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:1,1
Point to this like this.

40
0:2:1,1 --> 0:2:2,98
Point to this while facing the camera.

41
0:2:2,98 --> 0:2:3,48
And then?

42
0:2:3,48 --> 0:2:5,74
Then smile at the camera.

43
0:2:8,74 --> 0:2:10,62
The scene this afternoon seems quite complicated.

44
0:2:11,86 --> 0:2:15,5
He said the three major scenes are packed with information.

45
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:20,85
The crew said let the wind blow.

46
0:2:21,33 --> 0:2:22,71
This is not quite what I expected.

47
0:2:22,71 --> 0:2:25,65
It's like a planetarium, with a surround view.

48
0:2:25,65 --> 0:2:32,33
Our story should start with this person.

49
0:2:33,5 --> 0:2:34,45
My name is Li 18.

50
0:2:35,73 --> 0:2:38,51
I lived in 1942.

51
0:2:38,51 --> 0:2:41,25
I was the station master at the railway station.

52
0:2:42,47 --> 0:2:48,29
I have 47 minutes and 38 seconds left to live.

53
0:2:48,29 --> 0:2:49,59
This is the first scene.

54
0:2:49,59 --> 0:2:50,99
The play at the railway station theater.

55
0:2:50,99 --> 0:2:52,51
He talked about a tragic story between brothers

56
0:2:52,51 --> 0:2:55,41
Li Eleven and Li Eighteen

57
0:2:55,41 --> 0:2:57,89
during the great famine in Henan in 1942

58
0:2:57,89 --> 0:3:0,69
where the younger brother, Li Eighteen, was a guard at the grain warehouse

59
0:3:0,69 --> 0:3:3,3
while the older brother, Li Eleven, was at a dead end

60
0:3:3,3 --> 0:3:5,7
acting on behalf of the starving villagers to ask for seeds

61
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:8,4
Due to their different roles

62
0:3:8,4 --> 0:3:11,42
the older brother essentially caused his younger brother's death

63
0:3:11,42 --> 0:3:13,8
The plot of this scene is profound

64
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:15,98
And it possesses a strong dramatic conflict

65
0:3:15,98 --> 0:3:19,2
At the same time, there are some thoughtful designs in the expression

66
0:3:19,2 --> 0:3:21,28
For instance, it features a 360-degree circular theater

67
0:3:21,28 --> 0:3:23,579
It employs a unique montage technique

68
0:3:23,579 --> 0:3:25,139
In the train station scene

69
0:3:25,139 --> 0:3:28,88
A net is used to convey the oppressive feeling brought by the starving people

70
0:3:28,88 --> 0:3:31,78
It allows me to emotionally experience what hunger truly means

71
0:3:31,78 --> 0:3:34,28
The horror of turning humans into ghosts

72
0:3:36,16 --> 0:3:40,76
Dude, what can you do?

73
0:3:42,94 --> 0:3:44,14
What are you doing?

74
0:3:45,78 --> 0:3:47,88
What am I doing?

75
0:3:48,72 --> 0:3:53,93
If you want the seeds, you'll have to trade my brother's life for them.

76
0:3:54,25 --> 0:3:56,49
But without the seeds,

77
0:3:56,49 --> 0:4:0,25
these people won't survive.

78
0:4:0,81 --> 0:4:3,89
What am I doing?

79
0:4:4,81 --> 0:4:6,47
Heaven above,

80
0:4:6,47 --> 0:4:9,69
how could you be so cruel?

81
0:4:15,86 --> 0:4:18,48
How are you doing? Are you okay?

82
0:4:27,4 --> 0:4:29,8
Li, come out.

83
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:32,71
Come out quickly.

84
0:4:33,11 --> 0:4:34,27
Li Shi Yin

85
0:4:34,27 --> 0:4:35,91
Come out quickly.

86
0:4:35,91 --> 0:4:38,87
Everyone's here.

87
0:4:39,27 --> 0:4:40,39
Li

88
0:4:40,39 --> 0:4:43,19
We know there's food in the house.

89
0:4:43,19 --> 0:4:46,11
Come out, we're hungry.

90
0:4:46,11 --> 0:4:47,97
Everyone's here.

91
0:4:47,97 --> 0:4:49,23
Sure.

92
0:4:50,83 --> 0:4:53,51
The second scene takes place in Lijiacun village.

93
0:4:53,51 --> 0:4:56,23
It actually follows the story at the train station.

94
0:4:56,23 --> 0:4:59,7
This scene is incredibly emotionally charged.

95
0:4:59,7 --> 0:5:1,27
Many people were moved to tears on set.

96
0:5:1,27 --> 0:5:3,35
It’s even a bit suffocating.

97
0:5:3,35 --> 0:5:6,51
In this scene, the older brother Li brings back

98
0:5:6,51 --> 0:5:8,3
the grain he obtained by trading his younger brother’s life.

99
0:5:8,3 --> 0:5:8,7
After that,

100
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:10,48
He couldn’t let the villagers eat it

101
0:5:10,48 --> 0:5:13,2
because it had to be used as seeds for planting

102
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:15,68
so that the whole village could survive next year

103
0:5:15,68 --> 0:5:18,82
So the older generation of villagers in Li Family Village

104
0:5:18,82 --> 0:5:21,58
collectively went to the nearby mountain and froze to death

105
0:5:21,58 --> 0:5:23,82
leaving the chance to live for the next generation

106
0:5:23,82 --> 0:5:25,66
This story is a bit too heavy

107
0:5:25,66 --> 0:5:27,299
it’s making me feel a bit suffocated

108
0:5:27,299 --> 0:5:28,519
What about this play?

109
0:5:28,519 --> 0:5:32,539
Ultimately, it reinforced and elevated the Henan people's obsession with Empress Liu

110
0:5:32,539 --> 0:5:36,99
It's not just about continuing the lineage for a small family

111
0:5:36,99 --> 0:5:38,239
but also on a larger scale

112
0:5:38,239 --> 0:5:41,819
a sacrifice made for the continuation of the Chinese nation

113
0:5:43,62 --> 0:5:44,9
Oh heavens

114
0:5:45,98 --> 0:5:47,92
have mercy

115
0:5:47,92 --> 0:5:50,39
send a heavy snowfall

116
0:5:50,39 --> 0:5:54,55
to poison us all

117
0:6:29,76 --> 0:6:32,8
Actually, I think the background music is really well done

118
0:6:32,8 --> 0:6:34,42
I feel like throwing up every time that suona starts playing.

119
0:6:34,42 --> 0:6:35,5
As soon as the suona sounds,

120
0:6:35,5 --> 0:6:36,46
my tears start to flow.

121
0:6:36,46 --> 0:6:38,42
The old man's tears start to fall right away.

122
0:6:38,42 --> 0:6:39,76
The second act is great.

123
0:6:39,76 --> 0:6:41,22
Both the first and second acts are excellent.

124
0:6:41,22 --> 0:6:42,78
He has already formed a complete story structure.

125
0:6:42,78 --> 0:6:44,8
Actually, it can be said that

126
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:47,2
this part actually feels more like a story than the previous one.

127
0:6:47,2 --> 0:6:48,18
Because it's simpler

128
0:6:48,18 --> 0:6:49,26
He explained it more thoroughly

129
0:6:49,26 --> 0:6:50,48
There are far fewer flaws

130
0:6:50,48 --> 0:6:51,9
Yes, yes, yes

131
0:6:56,5 --> 0:7:1,65
Who's looking for me? I'm Kǒng Qiū

132
0:7:1,65 --> 0:7:5,86
What do you want with me?

133
0:7:6,54 --> 0:7:8,34
It's not that I have something

134
0:7:9,62 --> 0:7:15,57
It's these later generations talking about Confucius and Lǎozi

135
0:7:15,57 --> 0:7:23,14
That is, you and I met in Luoyi, Henan

136
0:7:23,14 --> 0:7:28,659
They said I should discuss some issues with you.

137
0:7:28,659 --> 0:7:31,179
The third scene has a very different atmosphere.

138
0:7:31,179 --> 0:7:34,87
It's a grand visual spectacle.

139
0:7:34,87 --> 0:7:37,19
This scene actually answers a question.

140
0:7:37,19 --> 0:7:39,31
If Henan was once known for its grain production,

141
0:7:39,31 --> 0:7:40,62
grain production was what Henan was known for,

142
0:7:40,62 --> 0:7:43,7
now our grain supply is no longer scarce.

143
0:7:43,7 --> 0:7:47,79
What else can Henan represent beyond its grain production?

144
0:7:47,79 --> 0:7:49,43
He uses a time-travel story to explore this.

145
0:7:49,43 --> 0:7:50,31
Throughout history,

146
0:7:50,31 --> 0:7:53,35
Henan's cultural luminaries have been gathered in the same time and space,

147
0:7:53,35 --> 0:7:55,15
I think it's a bit showy,

148
0:7:55,15 --> 0:7:56,89
like reciting a list of dishes,

149
0:7:56,89 --> 0:8:0,8
but Henan's ancestors were indeed quite affluent,

150
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:1,52
poets, philosophers,

151
0:8:1,52 --> 0:8:2,14
painters,

152
0:8:2,14 --> 0:8:2,82
statesmen,

153
0:8:2,82 --> 0:8:5,62
there are dozens of famous figures known throughout China.

154
0:8:5,62 --> 0:8:9,12
It's still a feast for the eyes with substance.

155
0:8:12,18 --> 0:8:13,86
It's done.

156
0:8:17,42 --> 0:8:20,89
It turned into a sigh.

157
0:8:20,89 --> 0:8:23,889
The battle scene was painted into this picture.

158
0:8:23,889 --> 0:8:27,45
It's the Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival.

159
0:8:27,89 --> 0:8:30,69
The Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival.

160
0:8:30,69 --> 0:8:36,9
I hope you're satisfied with how you look in the painting.

161
0:8:40,4 --> 0:8:42,16
It's alright.

162
0:8:47,1 --> 0:8:50,4
The three scenes together gave me the strongest impression of professionalism.

163
0:8:50,4 --> 0:8:53,95
Especially the first two scenes, which are so heavy and emotionally challenging.

164
0:8:53,95 --> 0:8:56,39
They can easily put too much pressure on the audience.

165
0:8:56,39 --> 0:8:57,37
Making it hard to watch.

166
0:8:57,37 --> 0:8:58,67
And not very appealing,

167
0:8:58,67 --> 0:9:0,61
But only in Henan, this place,

168
0:9:0,61 --> 0:9:2,97
I feel that the creative principles are more respected.

169
0:9:2,97 --> 0:9:4,67
The dramatic arrangement is excellent.

170
0:9:4,67 --> 0:9:7,99
It’s highly complete and also includes some clever designs and ideas.

171
0:9:7,99 --> 0:9:11,29
At the same time, it uses a constantly changing scene to create an immersive experience.

172
0:9:11,29 --> 0:9:13,339
to enhance the sense of immersion

173
0:9:13,339 --> 0:9:15,899
I think we need this high-level

174
0:9:15,899 --> 0:9:19,339
comprehensive content product for historical education

175
0:9:33,0 --> 0:9:37,14
we spent a day together in the Theater of Only Henan today

176
0:9:37,14 --> 0:9:39,1
we watched several performances together

177
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:41,5
and learned about the disasters that occurred in the past

178
0:9:41,5 --> 0:9:43,12
we watched three performances during the day

179
0:9:43,12 --> 0:9:46,86
next, we'll debate topics related to the performances we saw during the day

180
0:9:46,86 --> 0:9:50,57
specifically, the debate topic related to the Henan famine of 1942

181
0:9:50,57 --> 0:9:54,69
One of the debate topics we drew is whether, when reflecting on hardships, one should be immersed in them or stand outside of them.

182
0:9:54,69 --> 0:9:57,81
The question is whether one should be involved in the suffering or remain detached from it.

183
0:9:57,81 --> 0:9:59,15
We are the affirmative side.

184
0:9:59,15 --> 0:10:1,37
I will be the fourth speaker for the affirmative side.

185
0:10:1,37 --> 0:10:2,49
You need to pay attention to me too.

186
0:10:2,49 --> 0:10:3,1
I can do it.

187
0:10:3,1 --> 0:10:5,3
I need to guard against you accusing me of agreeing.

188
0:10:5,3 --> 0:10:6,93
But it is precisely because of social norms,

189
0:10:6,93 --> 0:10:9,12
that the overall trust cost in society is reduced.

190
0:10:9,12 --> 0:10:11,32
Everyone tends to think more about themselves

191
0:10:11,32 --> 0:10:13,14
I'll still go over that initial point

192
0:10:13,14 --> 0:10:15,22
We only set the rules

193
0:10:15,22 --> 0:10:17,82
Dare you explain why this question is valid

194
0:10:17,82 --> 0:10:19,18
Why it has become a debate topic

195
0:10:20,22 --> 0:10:21,94
It highlights the emergence of this social phenomenon

196
0:10:21,94 --> 0:10:24,66
We need to reflect on past hardships

197
0:10:24,66 --> 0:10:25,82
Because of moral

198
0:10:25,82 --> 0:10:28,2
We have entered a phase similar to a past hardship

199
0:10:28,2 --> 0:10:29,72
In similar social contexts

200
0:10:29,72 --> 0:10:30,92
or there's a risk

201
0:10:30,92 --> 0:10:34,2
that something like this could draw us into the scenario

202
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:35,64
then I proceed to construct

203
0:10:35,64 --> 0:10:36,64
why

204
0:10:36,64 --> 0:10:38,28
because the first three have already

205
0:10:38,28 --> 0:10:39,76
been established

206
0:10:39,76 --> 0:10:41,88
to explain what value we can derive from it

207
0:10:41,88 --> 0:10:42,76
I'll extend it further

208
0:10:42,76 --> 0:10:44,47
I think we can approach it this way.

209
0:10:44,47 --> 0:10:46,9
I've come to terms with the hardships of the past.

210
0:10:46,9 --> 0:10:47,7
I've let them all go.

211
0:10:47,7 --> 0:10:48,3
I stand outside the situation.

212
0:10:48,3 --> 0:10:50,15
But that doesn't mean I don't act in the present.

213
0:10:50,15 --> 0:10:52,88
It doesn't mean I'm indifferent to the suffering I see.

214
0:10:52,88 --> 0:10:55,28
Or the hardships others might face in the future.

215
0:10:55,28 --> 0:10:56,48
I won't hesitate to lend a helping hand.

216
0:10:56,48 --> 0:10:57,52
These are two different things.

217
0:10:57,52 --> 0:10:59,5
But what you're doing at this point is definitely wrong.

218
0:10:59,5 --> 0:11:1,18
For example, I can give specific instances.

219
0:11:1,18 --> 0:11:3,66
Like many people who haven't interacted with food delivery riders,

220
0:11:3,66 --> 0:11:6,46
assume that helping them means buying insurance for them.

221
0:11:6,46 --> 0:11:7,9
But if you have interacted with them,

222
0:11:7,9 --> 0:11:9,82
you'd realize that none of them want to buy a phone.

223
0:11:9,82 --> 0:11:11,9
If they don't want to spend money on it every day,

224
0:11:12,18 --> 0:11:12,78
I know, I get it.

225
0:11:12,78 --> 0:11:13,9
But his intention is good.

226
0:11:13,9 --> 0:11:16,66
To put it bluntly, if you really want to help others,

227
0:11:16,66 --> 0:11:17,98
you need to be understood by them.

228
0:11:17,98 --> 0:11:19,3
Then, all the roles you play,

229
0:11:19,3 --> 0:11:20,62
all the people you need to experience firsthand,

230
0:11:20,62 --> 0:11:23,54
in order to help this rider,

231
0:11:23,54 --> 0:11:24,18
what triggers it,

232
0:11:24,18 --> 0:11:25,55
but what exactly is it?

233
0:11:25,55 --> 0:11:27,67
I get it, I understand.

234
0:11:27,67 --> 0:11:31,37
It means a person has so many things to do in their lifetime.

235
0:11:31,37 --> 0:11:33,61
This family is writing down their memories

236
0:11:33,61 --> 0:11:36,98
This article tells me whether I should lose the child or save the bear

237
0:11:36,98 --> 0:11:38,6
He is perfect

238
0:11:38,6 --> 0:11:38,34
Just

239
0:11:38,34 --> 0:11:40,3
At that time, shouldn't we have had one

240
0:11:40,3 --> 0:11:42,16
We should have a complete understanding of the world

241
0:11:42,16 --> 0:11:43,95
There's also a preface that says

242
0:11:43,95 --> 0:11:45,15
Suppose I have 100 dollars

243
0:11:45,15 --> 0:11:45,93
Who should I save

244
0:11:45,93 --> 0:11:47,41
It's just about helping the disaster area.

245
0:11:47,41 --> 0:11:51,19
Or should we save the endangered animals, or the six gods?

246
0:11:51,19 --> 0:11:53,46
Who is he referring to?

247
0:11:53,46 --> 0:11:56,5
So it only affects your career and life.

248
0:11:58,2 --> 0:11:58,94
That's having emotions, isn't it?

249
0:11:58,94 --> 0:12:0,22
There must be current feelings.

250
0:12:0,22 --> 0:12:2,14
Otherwise, it just means you have no issues.

251
0:12:2,14 --> 0:12:3,6
You can manage to do things.

252
0:12:3,6 --> 0:12:4,54
You might face it with joy.

253
0:12:4,54 --> 0:12:6,34
I think you can tell the difference.

254
0:12:6,34 --> 0:12:7,4
Let's rank them by value.

255
0:12:7,4 --> 0:12:9,96
Let's say he is a 100, someone who should be rescued.

256
0:12:9,96 --> 0:12:11,34
You are a 99, or an 18.

257
0:12:12,42 --> 0:12:14,7
Here, I'll explain the rules for those who are not familiar with debates.

258
0:12:14,7 --> 0:12:15,73
Let me explain the rules.

259
0:12:15,73 --> 0:12:18,31
This postal debate format is relatively simplified.

260
0:12:18,31 --> 0:12:19,59
There's no cross-examination.

261
0:12:19,59 --> 0:12:22,47
No team free debate or other such rounds.

262
0:12:22,47 --> 0:12:24,41
So, the actual competition format is

263
0:12:24,41 --> 0:12:26,89
the first, second, and third debaters from both sides take turns to present their arguments

264
0:12:26,89 --> 0:12:31,51
interspersed with rebuttal rounds where the first, second, and third debaters face off against each other

265
0:12:31,51 --> 0:12:34,8
followed by the fourth debater concluding the debate

266
0:12:34,8 --> 0:12:37,92
finally, the judges vote to decide the winner and provide comments

267
0:12:40,5 --> 0:12:40,61
Hello everyone

268
0:12:40,61 --> 0:12:42,3
I am the first debater for the affirmative side, Xiao Hong

269
0:12:42,3 --> 0:12:43,35
my English name is Little Red

270
0:12:43,35 --> 0:12:44,65
it’s great to meet all of you

271
0:12:44,65 --> 0:12:46,9
Thanks for the benefits, everyone.

272
0:12:46,9 --> 0:12:48,6
Little r

273
0:12:48,58 --> 0:12:49,18
Hello everyone.

274
0:12:49,18 --> 0:12:51,18
I am the second debater for the affirmative side, Grape.

275
0:12:51,18 --> 0:12:52,72
My English name is Grape.

276
0:12:55,28 --> 0:12:55,84
Hello everyone.

277
0:12:55,84 --> 0:12:57,72
I am the third debater for the affirmative side, Yang Zijiang.

278
0:12:57,72 --> 0:12:58,62
My English name is River.

279
0:12:58,62 --> 0:13:1,87
I've seen everyone here.

280
0:13:1,87 --> 0:13:2,81
I'm Old Jiang.

281
0:13:2,81 --> 0:13:4,23
My English name is Reliable.

282
0:13:4,23 --> 0:13:10,95
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

283
0:13:10,95 --> 0:13:11,93
I'd like to ask you a question.

284
0:13:11,93 --> 0:13:14,49
Were you just projecting your dislike of Huang Shengyi onto that man?

285
0:13:15,13 --> 0:13:16,69
But I analyze this issue as

286
0:13:16,69 --> 0:13:18,819
Because I have moved past the pain from my original family

287
0:13:18,819 --> 0:13:20,139
You've moved beyond your own pain.

288
0:13:20,139 --> 0:13:21,899
But you haven't moved on from the pain of Huang Shengyi.

289
0:13:21,899 --> 0:13:24,499
Why should I care about his pain?

290
0:13:25,539 --> 0:13:27,89
Because you look like Yang Zi.

291
0:13:27,89 --> 0:13:28,79
Let me ask you another question.

292
0:13:28,79 --> 0:13:32,69
Have you ever heard of sanitary pads that cost ten yuan for thirty pieces?

293
0:13:32,69 --> 0:13:32,949
I have.

294
0:13:32,949 --> 0:13:34,209
Then someone asked, ‘Hey’,

295
0:13:34,209 --> 0:13:36,29
‘Why do you buy such cheap sanitary pads? They can't be good.’

296
0:13:36,29 --> 0:13:37,76
Guess what the comments below say?

297
0:13:38,8 --> 0:13:40,96
You'd think everyone would say, ‘Oh, these sanitary pads really aren't good.’

298
0:13:40,96 --> 0:13:41,66
Why did you buy it?

299
0:13:41,66 --> 0:13:42,76
You should explain to them.

300
0:13:42,76 --> 0:13:44,829
The woman said she has difficulties.

301
0:13:44,829 --> 0:13:46,349
Because you don’t know her difficulties.

302
0:13:46,349 --> 0:13:48,869
So you would say why you have difficulties using this sanitary pad.

303
0:13:48,869 --> 0:13:49,889
I should know better, right?

304
0:13:49,889 --> 0:13:53,84
The difficulty he mentioned is financial.

305
0:13:53,84 --> 0:13:55,92
It’s not about the usage.

306
0:13:57,72 --> 0:13:59,8
Alright, let’s move on to the summary.

307
0:13:59,8 --> 0:14:0,64
Zheng Tao three hundred

308
0:14:0,64 --> 0:14:2,27
Everyone, pay attention to the timing

309
0:14:2,27 --> 0:14:4,81
I think both sides have wasted a lot of time talking about

310
0:14:4,81 --> 0:14:6,27
Whose suffering this is

311
0:14:6,27 --> 0:14:7,95
You keep talking about your own suffering

312
0:14:7,95 --> 0:14:9,87
This question isn't about your own suffering

313
0:14:9,87 --> 0:14:12,83
We can't stand outside and reflect on our own suffering

314
0:14:12,83 --> 0:14:14,63
This question is about someone else's suffering

315
0:14:14,63 --> 0:14:15,39
And why

316
0:14:15,39 --> 0:14:16,27
It's because it has value.

317
0:14:16,27 --> 0:14:17,23
Two aspects of value.

318
0:14:17,23 --> 0:14:18,87
The first one I also see in Jianren Si.

319
0:14:18,87 --> 0:14:20,4
What I watch the most is the foreign community.

320
0:14:20,4 --> 0:14:22,74
What exactly is the issue with prostitution?

321
0:14:22,74 --> 0:14:23,56
I don't care if he's bad.

322
0:14:23,56 --> 0:14:26,659
But how is his moral framework constructed?

323
0:14:26,659 --> 0:14:27,659
How is morality constructed?

324
0:14:27,659 --> 0:14:31,4
It's about how we navigate two dilemmas in a difficult environment.

325
0:14:31,4 --> 0:14:32,42
We put this person in

326
0:14:32,42 --> 0:14:34,24
and also that person on a scale

327
0:14:34,24 --> 0:14:35,66
you go and measure

328
0:14:35,66 --> 0:14:38,48
we go through the trouble of pondering and weighing

329
0:14:38,48 --> 0:14:40,98
only then do we build our inner value system

330
0:14:40,98 --> 0:14:43,78
Mailing doesn't have the ability to measure this

331
0:14:43,78 --> 0:14:44,78
First, second

332
0:14:44,78 --> 0:14:46,62
he doesn't have the ability to place another on the scale

333
0:14:46,62 --> 0:14:48,28
he can only place himself on the scale

334
0:14:48,28 --> 0:14:49,64
He doesn't have that capability.

335
0:14:49,64 --> 0:14:52,51
So he can't be a fully moral being.

336
0:14:52,51 --> 0:14:54,839
So he is bad and he is foolish.

337
0:14:54,839 --> 0:14:57,799
If we could have such an ability,

338
0:14:57,799 --> 0:15:0,39
to watch a lot of film and television from a young age,

339
0:15:0,39 --> 0:15:1,339
what is its value?

340
0:15:1,339 --> 0:15:3,82
It immerses you in such a scenario,

341
0:15:3,82 --> 0:15:5,84
allowing you to safely empathize,

342
0:15:5,84 --> 0:15:8,42
with someone else's dilemma.

343
0:15:8,42 --> 0:15:9,82
Empathize with others' suffering

344
0:15:9,82 --> 0:15:11,56
Empathize with others' past suffering

345
0:15:11,56 --> 0:15:13,64
This cultivates your moral capacity

346
0:15:13,64 --> 0:15:15,39
That's one aspect

347
0:15:15,39 --> 0:15:18,19
The other is that I want to dismantle their trap

348
0:15:18,19 --> 0:15:19,22
They keep saying

349
0:15:19,22 --> 0:15:21,32
It's like empathizing with suffering

350
0:15:21,32 --> 0:15:23,14
It's as if you have to empathize emotionally

351
0:15:23,14 --> 0:15:24,1
That's completely wrong

352
0:15:24,1 --> 0:15:25,18
I choose not to bring in emotions

353
0:15:25,18 --> 0:15:26,44
What I care about is the situation

354
0:15:26,44 --> 0:15:27,67
What I bring in is the situation

355
0:15:27,67 --> 0:15:29,39
What was mentioned earlier is personal values

356
0:15:29,39 --> 0:15:31,5
Now, I'm talking about public values

357
0:15:31,5 --> 0:15:33,75
So why should our society encourage people

358
0:15:33,75 --> 0:15:35,63
to consider others' situations more

359
0:15:35,63 --> 0:15:36,43
Why

360
0:15:36,43 --> 0:15:38,63
is it because if you don't empathize

361
0:15:38,63 --> 0:15:41,78
You won't be able to make any correct decisions.

362
0:15:41,78 --> 0:15:43,6
So, a while back,

363
0:15:43,6 --> 0:15:44,86
I read a book called 'Why They Kill',

364
0:15:44,86 --> 0:15:47,82
it's about an American sociologist,

365
0:15:47,82 --> 0:15:48,78
named Ronni,

366
0:15:48,78 --> 0:15:50,55
the specifics of the name aren't important,

367
0:15:50,55 --> 0:15:51,27
anyway,

368
0:15:51,27 --> 0:15:54,93
his research focuses on why there are so many violent criminals,

369
0:15:54,93 --> 0:15:56,63
why they go around killing people.

370
0:15:56,63 --> 0:15:57,71
People form gangs

371
0:15:57,71 --> 0:16:0,49
Why was it him who achieved revolutionary results in the end

372
0:16:0,49 --> 0:16:2,83
He grew up in a community filled with violence

373
0:16:2,83 --> 0:16:3,99
His father was a violent man

374
0:16:3,99 --> 0:16:5,67
He has already made a revolutionary achievement

375
0:16:5,67 --> 0:16:8,68
It means that violent criminals are not inherently twisted from a young age

376
0:16:8,68 --> 0:16:11,4
But rather, they make rational choices

377
0:16:11,4 --> 0:16:13,87
Violence is his rational choice

378
0:16:13,87 --> 0:16:15,19
Why is it a rational choice

379
0:16:15,19 --> 0:16:17,73
Because he was subjected to various forms of violence from a young age

380
0:16:17,73 --> 0:16:19,51
he felt a sense of powerlessness inside

381
0:16:19,51 --> 0:16:20,79
his sense of order was shattered

382
0:16:20,79 --> 0:16:23,14
he needs to rebuild the order just as he established it

383
0:16:23,14 --> 0:16:25,28
the only power and order he knows is brute force

384
0:16:25,28 --> 0:16:29,28
so we can use this process to help alleviate the situation

385
0:16:29,28 --> 0:16:30,84
to prevent this from happening

386
0:16:30,84 --> 0:16:32,48
why is this possible

387
0:16:32,48 --> 0:16:34,8
because we can only achieve it by immersing ourselves in it

388
0:16:34,8 --> 0:16:35,12
We need to understand his situation.

389
0:16:35,12 --> 0:16:36,44
We need to see the solution.

390
0:16:36,44 --> 0:16:39,4
And the one who was just mentioned, Teacher Yao, right?

391
0:16:39,4 --> 0:16:39,78
Teacher Yao.

392
0:16:39,78 --> 0:16:42,14
He just made a mistake by not joining the flag team.

393
0:16:42,14 --> 0:16:44,26
He proposed a very incorrect statement.

394
0:16:44,26 --> 0:16:45,1
Regarding this issue.

395
0:16:45,1 --> 0:16:46,52
It's because there was no dry ice.

396
0:16:46,52 --> 0:16:49,25
It's because dry ice wasn't available in that era.

397
0:16:49,25 --> 0:16:51,77
So it seems that social resources are limited

398
0:16:51,77 --> 0:16:53,65
But the issue of limited social resources

399
0:16:53,65 --> 0:16:56,13
Exists in every era

400
0:16:56,13 --> 0:16:57,27
What really needs to be addressed is

401
0:16:57,27 --> 0:16:59,81
In situations where social resources are extremely scarce

402
0:16:59,81 --> 0:17:2,79
How to prevent political issues from exacerbating disasters

403
0:17:2,79 --> 0:17:4,77
It's because he hasn't put himself in the context

404
0:17:4,77 --> 0:17:6,75
He takes a highly technical and rational perspective

405
0:17:6,75 --> 0:17:8,7
He speaks from a very detached position

406
0:17:8,7 --> 0:17:9,7
You have dry ice, don't you?

407
0:17:9,7 --> 0:17:11,579
But the person involved isn't here.

408
0:17:11,579 --> 0:17:13,61
So, what problem are we trying to solve?

409
0:17:13,61 --> 0:17:15,73
I mean, how did the current famine come about?

410
0:17:15,73 --> 0:17:17,91
There's enough food to feed the entire world.

411
0:17:17,91 --> 0:17:19,52
It's due to political and distribution issues.

412
0:17:19,52 --> 0:17:22,8
This was precisely the issue faced in 1942.

413
0:17:22,8 --> 0:17:24,5
It's possible for the world's population to survive.

414
0:17:24,5 --> 0:17:25,76
You need to get involved.

415
0:17:25,76 --> 0:17:27,88
This is what drives social progress.

416
0:17:27,96 --> 0:17:29,8
Do I still have time?

417
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:32,24
321 hahaha

418
0:17:32,24 --> 0:17:36,84
Big brother, you stepped right on it!

419
0:17:40,88 --> 0:17:44,4
So, combining the audience votes, nine votes go to the affirmative side.

420
0:17:44,4 --> 0:17:45,4
Five votes to the negative side.

421
0:17:45,4 --> 0:17:45,82
Congratulations to the affirmative side.

422
0:17:45,82 --> 0:17:50,77
Then, the two panel judges also voted for the fourth speaker of the affirmative side.

423
0:17:50,77 --> 0:17:53,93
Old Jia, congratulations, well done.

424
0:17:53,93 --> 0:17:55,61
Everyone, let's stand for now.

425
0:17:55,61 --> 0:17:57,77
We'll announce the rules for tomorrow's game shortly.

426
0:17:57,77 --> 0:17:58,93
I've just finished the debate.

427
0:17:58,93 --> 0:18:1,39
Today has been a very fulfilling day.

428
0:18:1,39 --> 0:18:2,43
It's quite late now.

429
0:18:2,43 --> 0:18:5,47
We visited Only Henan Fantasy City.

430
0:18:5,47 --> 0:18:9,6
We watched three grand performances.

431
0:18:9,6 --> 0:18:10,34
The shows were incredibly rich and diverse.

432
0:18:10,34 --> 0:18:12,92
And in the evening, we had a debate related to this.

433
0:18:12,92 --> 0:18:15,1
I think the last one is quite simple.

434
0:18:15,1 --> 0:18:16,98
It's about everyone recommending that people buy tickets to watch.

435
0:18:16,98 --> 0:18:19,67
With this money, you can see three high-quality performances.

436
0:18:19,67 --> 0:18:20,95
Highly original ones,

437
0:18:20,95 --> 0:18:21,87
even with techniques,

438
0:18:21,87 --> 0:18:23,0
like innovative plays.

439
0:18:23,0 --> 0:18:25,88
And they are closely related to us Chinese.

440
0:18:25,88 --> 0:18:27,28
We inherit these skills and techniques.

441
0:18:27,28 --> 0:18:28,42
Only then do we know who we are.

442
0:18:28,42 --> 0:18:31,9
Anyway, if you have the chance, go and see it.

443
0:18:31,9 --> 0:18:34,18
And then there's the debate.

444
0:18:34,18 --> 0:18:35,49
Debating is something I really enjoy.

445
0:18:35,49 --> 0:18:38,7
This is actually my

446
0:18:38,7 --> 0:18:41,66
fourth or fifth debate experience, strictly speaking.

447
0:18:41,66 --> 0:18:43,94
I've been thinking about why I enjoy debating so much.

448
0:18:43,94 --> 0:18:45,18
While debating today,

449
0:18:45,18 --> 0:18:47,86
I was thinking about why I'm willing to invest time and effort

450
0:18:47,86 --> 0:18:49,0
and keep coming back.

451
0:18:49,0 --> 0:18:51,23
There isn't much financial incentive, you know.

452
0:18:51,23 --> 0:18:52,53
Debating is something

453
0:18:52,53 --> 0:18:54,82
that gives me a sense of the charm of offline expression.

454
0:18:54,82 --> 0:18:57,2
I might have tens of thousands of views on my online videos,

455
0:18:57,2 --> 0:18:59,0
and there are comments and feedback in the comment section,

456
0:18:59,0 --> 0:19:1,179
but it's still just a number.

457
0:19:1,179 --> 0:19:4,319
But with offline expression, I'm actually a lover of it.

458
0:19:4,319 --> 0:19:6,179
I'm not very used to

459
0:19:6,179 --> 0:19:8,78
talking confidently in front of a large group of people.

460
0:19:8,78 --> 0:19:10,68
I prefer more intimate conversations.

461
0:19:10,68 --> 0:19:13,58
But these moments make me feel very stimulated

462
0:19:13,58 --> 0:19:14,28
and excited.

463
0:19:14,28 --> 0:19:17,67
There's a kind of excitement that you don't get from online expression.

464
0:19:17,67 --> 0:19:19,57
Also, when you're forced to express yourself in front of so many people,

465
0:19:19,57 --> 0:19:21,91
the feedback you get when you enter that flow state is overwhelming.

466
0:19:21,91 --> 0:19:24,52
You get very clear and direct feedback,

467
0:19:25,17 --> 0:19:27,89
even from just thirty or forty audience members.

468
0:19:27,89 --> 0:19:30,77
You know for sure

469
0:19:30,77 --> 0:19:33,87
that they are captivated by my arguments,

470
0:19:33,87 --> 0:19:35,71
convinced by my points,

471
0:19:35,71 --> 0:19:36,91
and listening to me attentively.

472
0:19:36,91 --> 0:19:38,81
What I say influences their thoughts and feelings.

473
0:19:38,81 --> 0:19:42,13
This is a great sense of value and achievement.

474
0:19:42,13 --> 0:19:44,66
This is one of the unique charms of debating.

475
0:19:44,66 --> 0:19:47,1
This is why I love debating.

476
0:19:47,1 --> 0:19:48,82
So, that's it. I think this event is very valuable.

477
0:19:48,82 --> 0:19:52,3
And I really enjoyed it.

478
0:19:52,3 --> 0:19:53,83
If there are friends out there

479
0:19:53,83 --> 0:19:56,739
who like to watch me debate

480
0:19:56,739 --> 0:20:0,119
or are interested in following this event,

481
0:20:0,119 --> 0:20:2,59
you can follow me on January 11th

482
0:20:2,59 --> 0:20:4,39
as I participate in this novice debate competition, hehe,

483
0:20:4,39 --> 0:20:8,699
the New National Debate Masters Tournament.

484
0:20:8,699 --> 0:20:10,0
I'm Liang Qiuyang.

485
0:20:10,0 --> 0:20:11,12
Our team will be debating two very interesting topics.

486
0:20:11,12 --> 0:20:13,36
And on January 19th,

487
0:20:13,36 --> 0:20:14,68
I will continue to participate

488
0:20:14,68 --> 0:20:15,96
in the UPloader performance match of the New National Debate for the third consecutive year.

489
0:20:15,96 --> 0:20:19,49
Alright, let's wrap it up and celebrate!

490
0:20:19,49 --> 0:20:23,65
You saw how that criticism just cooled down the atmosphere I had heated up.

491
0:20:24,66 --> 0:20:29,84
I came down and froze it.

492
0:20:29,84 --> 0:20:31,8
But there's nothing I can do about it.

493
0:20:31,8 --> 0:20:32,1
I just know how to move.

494
0:20:32,1 --> 0:20:34,29
That's it.

495
0:20:34,31 --> 0:20:36,3
This is the exterior
