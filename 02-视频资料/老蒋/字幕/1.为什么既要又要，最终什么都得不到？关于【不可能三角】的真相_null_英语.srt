0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:0,52
Hello everyone.

2
0:0:0,52 --> 0:0:2,98
Many of you might have heard of the term 'impossible triangle'.

3
0:0:2,98 --> 0:0:6,6
It refers to three metrics in a system.

4
0:0:6,6 --> 0:0:8,38
It's impossible for all three to reach their maximum values simultaneously.

5
0:0:8,38 --> 0:0:9,7
This might sound a bit abstract.

6
0:0:9,7 --> 0:0:11,66
Let's take a smartphone as an example.

7
0:0:11,66 --> 0:0:13,8
A phone cannot achieve all of the following at the same time:

8
0:0:13,8 --> 0:0:15,45
Exceptional performance,

9
0:0:15,45 --> 0:0:16,85
and outstanding battery life.

10
0:0:16,85 --> 0:0:18,99
It's also very portable

11
0:0:18,99 --> 0:0:19,59
How to put it

12
0:0:19,59 --> 0:0:21,79
When a phone's performance is pushed to the max

13
0:0:21,79 --> 0:0:23,38
while still maintaining great battery life

14
0:0:23,38 --> 0:0:24,6
it means you can use it for a lot

15
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:26,509
like playing games for 20 hours straight

16
0:0:26,509 --> 0:0:29,149
it's inevitable that the phone won't be compact

17
0:0:29,149 --> 0:0:31,269
because the battery takes up a lot of space

18
0:0:31,269 --> 0:0:34,7
if a phone has excellent performance

19
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:35,7
It's also very portable

20
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:36,64
The phone is quite compact

21
0:0:36,64 --> 0:0:39,46
Then its battery life would inevitably be a bit of an issue

22
0:0:39,46 --> 0:0:41,3
Because it just can't last for a long time

23
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:43,74
Now, if a phone has great battery life

24
0:0:43,74 --> 0:0:44,64
It's also very portable

25
0:0:44,64 --> 0:0:47,5
It would have to sacrifice some performance

26
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:50,26
For instance, even if its SOC doesn't have a significant impact

27
0:0:50,26 --> 0:0:52,2
But its camera module couldn't be that large

28
0:0:52,2 --> 0:0:54,29
This is the impossible triangle on a smartphone

29
0:0:54,29 --> 0:0:56,29
In fact, there are many other impossible triangles

30
0:0:56,29 --> 0:0:57,75
For instance, in the municipal transportation sector

31
0:0:57,75 --> 0:0:59,5
In a transportation system

32
0:0:59,5 --> 0:1:2,81
It's impossible to have a very high average speed for vehicles

33
0:1:2,81 --> 0:1:5,25
while also having a high road utilization rate

34
0:1:5,25 --> 0:1:8,55
with a lot of cars packed into the same lanes

35
0:1:8,55 --> 0:1:11,34
extremely congested and with a low accident rate

36
0:1:11,34 --> 0:1:12,18
You can't achieve that

37
0:1:12,18 --> 0:1:15,33
When everyone drives fast in a city's traffic system,

38
0:1:15,33 --> 0:1:17,27
and the roads are also very congested,

39
0:1:17,27 --> 0:1:19,17
the accident rate can't possibly be low.

40
0:1:19,17 --> 0:1:19,85
Let me give another example.

41
0:1:19,85 --> 0:1:21,71
Take our profession, for instance,

42
0:1:21,71 --> 0:1:23,19
UPloaders or video bloggers,

43
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:26,61
it's impossible to simultaneously maintain a very high update frequency,

44
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:27,79
very high content quality,

45
0:1:27,79 --> 0:1:29,42
and a very strong originality.

46
0:1:29,42 --> 0:1:31,1
Assuming you can update daily

47
0:1:31,1 --> 0:1:32,58
and your content quality is exceptionally high

48
0:1:32,58 --> 0:1:34,6
then it's highly likely

49
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:36,64
that your content heavily draws from many peers

50
0:1:36,64 --> 0:1:37,98
and is compiled and summarized

51
0:1:37,98 --> 0:1:40,6
or when your update frequency

52
0:1:40,6 --> 0:1:41,54
can quickly reach a daily update

53
0:1:41,54 --> 0:1:42,62
with strong originality

54
0:1:42,62 --> 0:1:43,54
all written by yourself

55
0:1:43,54 --> 0:1:46,52
Then the quality of your content won't be as good as it could be

56
0:1:46,52 --> 0:1:49,88
For instance, you apply the same methodology to different trending topics

57
0:1:49,88 --> 0:1:52,0
Just repeating the same old clichÃ©s

58
0:1:52,0 --> 0:1:54,5
This is a very common and normal phenomenon

59
0:1:54,5 --> 0:1:57,6
So this video starts with the concept of the impossible triangle

60
0:1:57,6 --> 0:1:59,339
We'll delve deeper layer by layer

61
0:1:59,339 --> 0:2:1,559
Let's play a thought experiment or a mind game

62
0:2:1,559 --> 0:2:4,199
And keep pushing to uncover the essence

63
0:2:4,199 --> 0:2:5,199
To see what it really is

64
0:2:5,199 --> 0:2:6,87
What kind of insights can it bring us?

65
0:2:6,87 --> 0:2:10,99
This is likely the most in-depth one you can find online.

66
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:13,47
Some breakdowns of the impossible triangle.

67
0:2:13,47 --> 0:2:15,2
And reflections.

68
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:17,4
First, let's look at the essence of the impossible triangle.

69
0:2:17,4 --> 0:2:18,12
The first level.

70
0:2:18,12 --> 0:2:20,28
At the first level, we can see a multitude of impossibilities.

71
0:2:20,28 --> 0:2:22,64
The triangle can be abstracted into three elements.

72
0:2:22,64 --> 0:2:24,1
The first element is efficiency.

73
0:2:24,1 --> 0:2:26,41
The second factor is Space

74
0:2:26,41 --> 0:2:28,1
The third factor is Time

75
0:2:28,1 --> 0:2:31,15
These three factors often conflict with each other

76
0:2:31,15 --> 0:2:32,35
The first efficiency

77
0:2:32,35 --> 0:2:36,44
can often be represented as performance or benefit

78
0:2:36,44 --> 0:2:38,54
or efficiency or score

79
0:2:38,54 --> 0:2:41,82
Space can also be abstracted as scale

80
0:2:41,82 --> 0:2:44,16
including the scope of application of something

81
0:2:44,16 --> 0:2:46,49
or the coverage of a feature

82
0:2:46,49 --> 0:2:47,69
The target audience

83
0:2:47,69 --> 0:2:49,53
Or we can flip it around

84
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:52,67
It can also be abstracted as the necessary expenditure

85
0:2:52,67 --> 0:2:55,95
Because cost and scale are actually interrelated factors

86
0:2:55,95 --> 0:2:59,27
Time, for instance, can be the physical duration

87
0:2:59,27 --> 0:3:0,83
Or it can be the risk involved

88
0:3:0,83 --> 0:3:1,959
Or the success rate

89
0:3:1,959 --> 0:3:3,559
Because as the risk increases

90
0:3:3,559 --> 0:3:5,75
The duration inevitably cannot be very long

91
0:3:5,75 --> 0:3:8,47
So, after abstracting from numerous impossible triangles,

92
0:3:8,47 --> 0:3:9,29
it comes down to efficiency,

93
0:3:9,29 --> 0:3:12,37
the contradiction between Space, and time.

94
0:3:12,37 --> 0:3:13,73
Let's move on to the next level.

95
0:3:13,73 --> 0:3:14,55
The second level.

96
0:3:14,55 --> 0:3:15,99
The second level is about the impossibility,

97
0:3:15,99 --> 0:3:17,15
the essence of the triangle.

98
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:18,83
We can view it as,

99
0:3:18,83 --> 0:3:23,61
when a system has three elements that are pairwise negatively correlated.

100
0:3:23,61 --> 0:3:26,59
These elements will compete for weight with each other

101
0:3:26,59 --> 0:3:29,25
As a result, they can't all be maximized at the same time

102
0:3:29,25 --> 0:3:30,85
Or let me put it another way

103
0:3:30,85 --> 0:3:34,9
When there are three elements in the system that are pairwise negatively correlated

104
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:36,86
Each element can essentially

105
0:3:36,86 --> 0:3:39,44
Be transformed through the other two

106
0:3:44,24 --> 0:3:45,94
One always has to consider

107
0:3:45,94 --> 0:3:48,78
What sacrifices I need to make to boost one or two metrics

108
0:3:48,78 --> 0:3:50,66
What cost I need to pay

109
0:3:50,66 --> 0:3:53,44
I hope to enhance a particular benefit at the cost of one or two factors.

110
0:3:53,44 --> 0:3:55,46
This is essentially the kind of decision-making process people engage in.

111
0:3:55,46 --> 0:3:57,88
Let's delve a bit deeper.

112
0:3:57,88 --> 0:3:59,2
Let's go even further down.

113
0:3:59,2 --> 0:3:59,94
Why is the impossible triangle so frustrating?

114
0:3:59,94 --> 0:4:2,84
Why can't we have everything we want?

115
0:4:2,84 --> 0:4:5,6
Because the physical world is subject to increasing entropy.

116
0:4:5,6 --> 0:4:6,66
Because the second law of thermodynamics governs this world.

117
0:4:6,66 --> 0:4:8,94
Because the second law of thermodynamics exists in this world.

118
0:4:8,94 --> 0:4:11,45
So what does the Second Law of Thermodynamics tell us?

119
0:4:11,45 --> 0:4:13,51
It tells us that over time,

120
0:4:13,51 --> 0:4:18,1
a closed or isolated system will inevitably experience an increase in entropy.

121
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:19,93
This increase in entropy has two manifestations.

122
0:4:19,93 --> 0:4:21,69
The first manifestation is that

123
0:4:21,69 --> 0:4:24,659
the disorder within the system will continually rise.

124
0:4:24,659 --> 0:4:26,799
The accumulated risks will continue to expand.

125
0:4:26,799 --> 0:4:28,259
Eventually, the system will collapse.

126
0:4:28,259 --> 0:4:29,439
It cannot sustain itself indefinitely.

127
0:4:29,439 --> 0:4:33,13
The second manifestation is the different elements within this system

128
0:4:33,13 --> 0:4:36,36
They rapidly transform and flow between each other

129
0:4:36,36 --> 0:4:38,14
Ultimately leading to a decrease in free energy

130
0:4:38,14 --> 0:4:40,6
Which means the system's vitality diminishes

131
0:4:40,6 --> 0:4:42,2
And it becomes a state of lifelessness

132
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:43,48
A state of rigidity

133
0:4:43,48 --> 0:4:46,6
This also means the system cannot be sustained

134
0:4:46,6 --> 0:4:47,76
This might sound a bit too abstract

135
0:4:47,76 --> 0:4:48,7
Let me give you some examples

136
0:4:48,7 --> 0:4:51,86
What is the increase in disorder leading to entropy?

137
0:4:51,86 --> 0:4:53,66
Then what about the situation where the system can no longer continue?

138
0:4:53,66 --> 0:4:56,329
For example, let's look at NBA players.

139
0:4:56,329 --> 0:5:1,46
Their playing time, their contribution on the court, and their health cannot be guaranteed simultaneously.

140
0:5:1,46 --> 0:5:2,9
You can't ensure all of these aspects at the same time.

141
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:6,44
It means you can't play over 40 minutes every game.

142
0:5:6,44 --> 0:5:9,9
You can't push your body to the limit without regard for the consequences.

143
0:5:9,9 --> 0:5:12,4
That means making contributions on both offense and defense.

144
0:5:12,4 --> 0:5:12,98
Being fully committed

145
0:5:12,98 --> 0:5:14,8
No slacking off

146
0:5:14,8 --> 0:5:15,76
and on the court

147
0:5:15,76 --> 0:5:18,54
blocking, rebounding, and scoring with all my might

148
0:5:18,54 --> 0:5:20,64
the intensity on the court is maxed out

149
0:5:20,64 --> 0:5:21,789
speed is also at its peak

150
0:5:21,789 --> 0:5:24,549
this way, your injuries will inevitably accumulate

151
0:5:24,549 --> 0:5:26,589
the accumulation of injuries is essentially the buildup of disorder

152
0:5:26,589 --> 0:5:28,0
eventually leading to system failure

153
0:5:28,0 --> 0:5:28,96
what kind of system failure?

154
0:5:28,96 --> 0:5:30,42
It's your body system that's breaking down

155
0:5:30,42 --> 0:5:33,24
Now, in the municipal traffic system we mentioned earlier

156
0:5:33,24 --> 0:5:35,72
When everyone is driving very fast on the roads

157
0:5:35,72 --> 0:5:37,62
And the roads are extremely congested

158
0:5:37,62 --> 0:5:40,3
Given that the world is subject to increasing entropy

159
0:5:40,3 --> 0:5:42,88
Drivers are bound to make mistakes

160
0:5:42,88 --> 0:5:44,809
The system is bound to experience disturbances

161
0:5:44,809 --> 0:5:46,549
Which in turn increases the risk

162
0:5:46,549 --> 0:5:48,69
Thus, accidents will occur on the roads

163
0:5:48,69 --> 0:5:50,25
After accidents pile up

164
0:5:50,25 --> 0:5:51,91
it simply can't function properly anymore

165
0:5:51,91 --> 0:5:53,99
In the case of municipal traffic

166
0:5:53,99 --> 0:5:56,34
if everyone is moving at high speeds

167
0:5:56,34 --> 0:5:57,98
and the roads are congested

168
0:5:57,98 --> 0:5:59,26
the margin for error is very low

169
0:5:59,26 --> 0:6:0,48
and people can't afford to make mistakes

170
0:6:0,48 --> 0:6:2,5
but no matter how careful you are

171
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:3,58
mistakes will inevitably happen

172
0:6:3,58 --> 0:6:5,32
Whether it's due to mechanical failure

173
0:6:5,32 --> 0:6:7,0
or due to the driver's carelessness

174
0:6:7,0 --> 0:6:8,84
the accident rate is bound to rise

175
0:6:8,84 --> 0:6:11,24
This is due to the risk accumulated within the system

176
0:6:11,24 --> 0:6:13,94
The second form of entropy increase is the decline in free energy, right?

177
0:6:13,94 --> 0:6:14,87
What does that mean?

178
0:6:14,87 --> 0:6:16,97
In reality, it means within this system

179
0:6:16,97 --> 0:6:19,62
through the natural flow between its various components

180
0:6:19,62 --> 0:6:22,76
more competitors are entering to do the same thing

181
0:6:22,76 --> 0:6:25,62
This leads to a continuous reduction in the space where you can act.

182
0:6:25,62 --> 0:6:27,11
Eventually, you won't be able to get things done.

183
0:6:27,11 --> 0:6:29,13
For example, let's take a smartphone.

184
0:6:29,13 --> 0:6:30,7
A smartphone can't do this.

185
0:6:30,7 --> 0:6:32,2
The triangle is actually a classic example of a decrease in free energy.

186
0:6:32,2 --> 0:6:35,12
That is, when performance is pushed to an extreme level.

187
0:6:35,12 --> 0:6:36,539
At the same time, the battery is very small.

188
0:6:36,539 --> 0:6:39,39
So as you use it, the chemical energy gets depleted.

189
0:6:39,39 --> 0:6:41,239
Then the potential difference inside is leveled out.

190
0:6:41,239 --> 0:6:42,979
Then the phone can't discharge anymore

191
0:6:42,979 --> 0:6:44,56
As a result, the system collapses

192
0:6:44,56 --> 0:6:47,84
For example, in the business world

193
0:6:47,84 --> 0:6:48,8
When we start a business

194
0:6:48,8 --> 0:6:51,62
You'll find it hard to find one

195
0:6:51,62 --> 0:6:53,4
With a high profit margin

196
0:6:53,4 --> 0:6:55,2
And the business has a large scale

197
0:6:55,2 --> 0:6:57,77
For instance, it's not just a daily income of 1,000

198
0:6:57,77 --> 0:6:59,93
Its maximum annual revenue

199
0:6:59,93 --> 0:7:1,21
If done well, it can reach hundreds of millions.

200
0:7:1,21 --> 0:7:2,41
The market size is substantial.

201
0:7:2,41 --> 0:7:4,82
Moreover, its certainty is also high.

202
0:7:4,82 --> 0:7:6,64
You won't find such an opportunity elsewhere.

203
0:7:6,64 --> 0:7:8,46
Why is there such an impossible triangle?

204
0:7:8,46 --> 0:7:11,42
Because you're not the only one doing business in this market.

205
0:7:11,42 --> 0:7:13,6
The market factors are constantly in flux.

206
0:7:13,6 --> 0:7:15,64
Information is continuously flowing.

207
0:7:15,64 --> 0:7:19,14
Assuming a business has a great scale

208
0:7:19,14 --> 0:7:20,56
The wealthy and the smart

209
0:7:20,56 --> 0:7:21,36
as well as those who are very capable

210
0:7:21,36 --> 0:7:21,98
all see the potential

211
0:7:21,98 --> 0:7:24,21
and recognize the high market certainty

212
0:7:24,21 --> 0:7:26,15
everyone knows that this field can make money

213
0:7:26,15 --> 0:7:27,87
like the current AI sector

214
0:7:27,87 --> 0:7:30,11
which means the competition will be intense

215
0:7:30,11 --> 0:7:30,93
with fierce competition

216
0:7:30,93 --> 0:7:32,39
profit margins will be squeezed

217
0:7:32,39 --> 0:7:34,81
So, there actually exists a window of opportunity within this.

218
0:7:34,81 --> 0:7:38,27
This is a period when the market can simultaneously achieve very high profit margins,

219
0:7:38,27 --> 0:7:38,99
a large scale,

220
0:7:38,99 --> 0:7:41,35
and a high level of certainty, but such a window is fleeting.

221
0:7:41,35 --> 0:7:41,77
Why?

222
0:7:41,77 --> 0:7:44,9
Because the information gap is quickly closed through the flow of resources.

223
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:46,8
As a result, the potential for profit diminishes,

224
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:47,66
and you wonât find such opportunities anymore.

225
0:7:47,66 --> 0:7:49,289
What Iâve described is

226
0:7:49,289 --> 0:7:51,929
Why the impossible triangle can't exist in large numbers

227
0:7:51,929 --> 0:7:53,969
is because the world is in a state of increasing entropy

228
0:7:53,969 --> 0:7:55,169
Let's delve a bit deeper

229
0:7:55,169 --> 0:7:56,76
The fourth layer is the impossibility

230
0:7:56,76 --> 0:7:58,74
Is the impossible triangle truly impossible?

231
0:7:58,74 --> 0:8:0,879
Many people might not fully grasp this

232
0:8:0,879 --> 0:8:1,799
And thus have this impression

233
0:8:1,799 --> 0:8:3,859
Since it's called the impossible triangle

234
0:8:3,859 --> 0:8:5,519
It implies that

235
0:8:5,519 --> 0:8:9,3
We can never pursue these three elements simultaneously.

236
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:11,63
But observing real life reveals that.

237
0:8:11,63 --> 0:8:13,23
For example, the UPloader I mentioned earlier.

238
0:8:13,23 --> 0:8:14,41
This impossible triangle, right?

239
0:8:14,41 --> 0:8:15,17
Update frequency,

240
0:8:15,17 --> 0:8:15,91
Originality,

241
0:8:15,91 --> 0:8:17,51
and content quality.

242
0:8:17,51 --> 0:8:19,72
Compared to me, Luo Xiang

243
0:8:19,72 --> 0:8:21,14
has a faster update frequency.

244
0:8:21,14 --> 0:8:23,169
The content quality is also higher than mine

245
0:8:23,169 --> 0:8:24,409
In terms of originality

246
0:8:24,409 --> 0:8:25,649
His originality is on par with mine

247
0:8:25,649 --> 0:8:26,449
Itâs all in his own words

248
0:8:26,449 --> 0:8:28,229
Heâs got a bigger edge in all three aspects

249
0:8:28,229 --> 0:8:31,28
We talked about the player's playing time

250
0:8:31,28 --> 0:8:32,8
Contribution and injuries

251
0:8:32,8 --> 0:8:34,4
Compared to me, Jordan

252
0:8:34,4 --> 0:8:36,52
If we were to play in the same game

253
0:8:36,52 --> 0:8:38,14
He has more playing time than me

254
0:8:38,14 --> 0:8:40,33
and he also contributes more

255
0:8:40,33 --> 0:8:41,99
and he is healthier

256
0:8:41,99 --> 0:8:43,299
with a lower risk of injury

257
0:8:43,299 --> 0:8:45,479
he excels in all three aspects compared to me

258
0:8:45,479 --> 0:8:46,939
or let's take a look at smartphones

259
0:8:46,939 --> 0:8:49,159
today's phones compared to those from two years ago

260
0:8:49,159 --> 0:8:52,18
could very well have better performance

261
0:8:52,18 --> 0:8:53,4
and better battery life

262
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:54,8
And it's also lighter and thinner.

263
0:8:54,8 --> 0:8:55,96
This is entirely possible.

264
0:8:55,96 --> 0:8:58,329
So why is this the case?

265
0:8:58,329 --> 0:9:0,989
Or perhaps we should approach it from a different angle and think in reverse.

266
0:9:0,989 --> 0:9:3,829
We often find that many capabilities fall short.

267
0:9:3,829 --> 0:9:5,98
Or in systems with limited resources.

268
0:9:5,98 --> 0:9:8,16
You might find yourself in an impossible dilemma.

269
0:9:8,16 --> 0:9:11,36
Or we could call it a false dichotomy.

270
0:9:11,36 --> 0:9:14,16
When a phone company is relatively inexperienced.

271
0:9:14,16 --> 0:9:17,34
Just addressing the conflict between performance and battery life

272
0:9:17,34 --> 0:9:18,44
is already a tough challenge

273
0:9:18,44 --> 0:9:19,62
meaning if the performance is good

274
0:9:19,62 --> 0:9:20,6
the battery life will inevitably be poor

275
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:21,9
and if you want to improve battery life

276
0:9:21,9 --> 0:9:23,1
you have to compromise on performance

277
0:9:23,1 --> 0:9:25,32
like when a player isn't very skilled

278
0:9:25,32 --> 0:9:28,7
for instance, just balancing my playing time and contribution

279
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:29,14
I can't have both

280
0:9:29,14 --> 0:9:29,66
Why

281
0:9:29,66 --> 0:9:32,4
Because my physical condition only allows me to last for a quarter of an hour

282
0:9:32,4 --> 0:9:34,66
If I want to have a higher contribution

283
0:9:34,66 --> 0:9:37,6
I have to reduce my playing time

284
0:9:37,6 --> 0:9:39,8
This is not a false dichotomy

285
0:9:39,8 --> 0:9:41,4
So from the examples above

286
0:9:41,4 --> 0:9:42,22
I believe you can see

287
0:9:42,22 --> 0:9:45,74
The impossible triangle is actually a special case of an impossible N-gon

288
0:9:45,74 --> 0:9:47,5
Impossible triangles do exist in this world

289
0:9:47,5 --> 0:9:48,28
Impossible triangle

290
0:9:48,28 --> 0:9:49,8
Impossible quadrilateral

291
0:9:49,8 --> 0:9:50,2
There's even an impossible pentagon

292
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:52,98
So, to turn an impossible N-sided shape into an impossible N+1-sided shape

293
0:9:52,98 --> 0:9:54,0
What needs to be done?

294
0:9:54,0 --> 0:9:55,2
How can we break the deadlock?

295
0:9:55,2 --> 0:9:56,43
Actually, there are two approaches

296
0:9:56,43 --> 0:9:58,37
One approach is to break the deadlock with force

297
0:9:58,37 --> 0:10:1,65
That is, when you're out of options within the system

298
0:10:1,65 --> 0:10:5,9
You introduce negative energy from outside the system to revitalize it internally.

299
0:10:5,9 --> 0:10:8,68
Sometimes, this approach can achieve a triple win.

300
0:10:8,68 --> 0:10:11,42
Another strategy is to break the deadlock with ingenuity.

301
0:10:11,42 --> 0:10:14,42
This means you donât rely on external forces.

302
0:10:14,42 --> 0:10:17,2
Instead, you enhance the internal systemâs capabilities.

303
0:10:17,2 --> 0:10:19,79
By improving the efficiency of converting different elements within the system,

304
0:10:19,79 --> 0:10:20,219
you can also break the deadlock.

305
0:10:20,219 --> 0:10:21,719
This might sound too abstract,

306
0:10:21,719 --> 0:10:22,499
so let me give you an example.

307
0:10:22,499 --> 0:10:24,659
Like the UPloader I mentioned just now, right?

308
0:10:24,659 --> 0:10:26,719
Even UPloaders can't manage to do all of these at the same time.

309
0:10:26,719 --> 0:10:27,849
Maintain high content quality,

310
0:10:27,849 --> 0:10:29,9
update frequently,

311
0:10:29,9 --> 0:10:29,989
and be highly original.

312
0:10:29,989 --> 0:10:31,429
So, how can we break this deadlock?

313
0:10:31,429 --> 0:10:33,349
For a thinking system like mine,

314
0:10:33,349 --> 0:10:34,86
I might have reached my limits.

315
0:10:34,86 --> 0:10:36,64
But I can build a team.

316
0:10:36,64 --> 0:10:37,54
Building a team

317
0:10:37,54 --> 0:10:40,7
is actually about getting other teammates to contribute to this creation system

318
0:10:40,7 --> 0:10:41,38
for comfort

319
0:10:41,38 --> 0:10:43,62
so I can ensure the quality of the content

320
0:10:43,62 --> 0:10:45,8
while maintaining originality

321
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:47,58
and then increase my update frequency, right?

322
0:10:47,58 --> 0:10:49,69
This impossible triangle is thus broken

323
0:10:49,69 --> 0:10:50,729
What I mentioned earlier was breaking the deadlock with resources

324
0:10:50,729 --> 0:10:52,109
So what does breaking the deadlock with ingenuity mean?

325
0:10:52,109 --> 0:10:54,629
I might have learned something new

326
0:10:54,629 --> 0:10:56,71
I might have explored some new fields

327
0:10:56,71 --> 0:10:58,53
As a result, my knowledge has grown

328
0:10:58,53 --> 0:11:0,55
Consequently, my creative methodology has improved

329
0:11:0,55 --> 0:11:2,25
Or I might have discovered a fresh perspective

330
0:11:2,25 --> 0:11:3,55
This situation could also change

331
0:11:3,55 --> 0:11:6,21
For instance, I wouldn't speak in such a boring way

332
0:11:6,21 --> 0:11:8,35
I could incorporate some talk show techniques

333
0:11:8,35 --> 0:11:10,87
This way, I can ensure my show is highly engaging

334
0:11:10,87 --> 0:11:12,39
In a sense, the quality is very high.

335
0:11:12,39 --> 0:11:14,83
At the same time, I can increase my update frequency.

336
0:11:14,83 --> 0:11:16,81
And all of this content is written by me.

337
0:11:16,81 --> 0:11:18,93
This is in the context of the UPloader example.

338
0:11:18,93 --> 0:11:21,18
In the context of the smartphone example, then.

339
0:11:21,18 --> 0:11:22,18
To break the deadlock with force.

340
0:11:22,18 --> 0:11:23,68
It might seem rather mindless.

341
0:11:23,68 --> 0:11:27,17
For instance, cloud computing is a way to break the performance deadlock.

342
0:11:27,17 --> 0:11:29,43
On this point, I introduce an external service provider.

343
0:11:29,43 --> 0:11:31,13
I don't rely on the SOC of the phone

344
0:11:31,13 --> 0:11:32,8
nor do I depend on its processing units for computation

345
0:11:32,8 --> 0:11:34,58
in fact, I rely on the network

346
0:11:34,58 --> 0:11:38,34
to bring external computing power into the phone for my use

347
0:11:38,34 --> 0:11:40,36
thus, I can break through this impossible triangle

348
0:11:40,36 --> 0:11:41,78
I might be able to make the battery very small

349
0:11:41,78 --> 0:11:43,67
but its processing speed doesn't decrease

350
0:11:43,67 --> 0:11:45,35
what other ways can break the deadlock?

351
0:11:45,35 --> 0:11:46,87
for example, I can use this room

352
0:11:46,87 --> 0:11:49,43
I've transformed this space so it can be used anywhere.

353
0:11:49,43 --> 0:11:50,43
You just place your phone on it.

354
0:11:50,43 --> 0:11:53,0
It becomes a room where wireless charging is possible.

355
0:11:53,0 --> 0:11:54,76
So, the phone doesn't need to rely on its internal power all the time.

356
0:11:54,76 --> 0:11:56,76
It doesn't have to use the energy within its system constantly.

357
0:11:56,76 --> 0:11:59,14
The internal energy source won't be the sole provider for its computations.

358
0:11:59,14 --> 0:12:1,42
This way, the impossible triangle issue can be resolved.

359
0:12:1,42 --> 0:12:2,96
This is the brute force approach.

360
0:12:2,96 --> 0:12:6,68
The clever approach is to leverage advancements in technology.

361
0:12:6,68 --> 0:12:8,48
As our manufacturing processes advance

362
0:12:8,48 --> 0:12:9,68
I have a new manufacturing process

363
0:12:9,68 --> 0:12:11,62
new material technologies or batteries

364
0:12:11,62 --> 0:12:13,68
if energy density can take a step up

365
0:12:13,68 --> 0:12:15,7
this impossible triangle can also be broken

366
0:12:15,7 --> 0:12:16,62
Let me give another example

367
0:12:16,62 --> 0:12:17,7
As I mentioned earlier

368
0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:18,86
In an economic system

369
0:12:18,86 --> 0:12:20,2
if you want to start a business

370
0:12:20,2 --> 0:12:22,819
It's hard to find a business with high profit margins,

371
0:12:22,819 --> 0:12:23,699
large scale,

372
0:12:23,699 --> 0:12:25,68
and high certainty, right?

373
0:12:25,68 --> 0:12:27,14
Is it even possible?

374
0:12:27,14 --> 0:12:29,92
It might have been possible during the early stages of Reform and Opening up,

375
0:12:29,92 --> 0:12:31,6
when we could achieve this.

376
0:12:31,6 --> 0:12:31,84
Why is that?

377
0:12:31,84 --> 0:12:33,14
Because in the early stages of Reform and Opening up,

378
0:12:33,14 --> 0:12:36,18
the market was continuously expanding.

379
0:12:36,18 --> 0:12:40,46
In reality, the system has been continuously fueled by substantial investments from wealthy businessmen.

380
0:12:40,46 --> 0:12:42,42
So back then, opportunities were everywhere.

381
0:12:42,42 --> 0:12:43,6
It was a time when gold was lying on the ground, waiting to be picked up.

382
0:12:43,6 --> 0:12:44,92
All you needed was to put in a certain amount of effort.

383
0:12:44,92 --> 0:12:45,88
And as long as you were smart,

384
0:12:45,88 --> 0:12:48,83
you could find opportunities where all three elements were present, right?

385
0:12:48,83 --> 0:12:51,27
That's why so many legendary entrepreneurs emerged during that time.

386
0:12:51,27 --> 0:12:53,23
They essentially benefited from the era's advantages.

387
0:12:53,23 --> 0:12:54,43
The advantages of that era.

388
0:12:54,43 --> 0:12:56,81
The so-called era dividend is a massive tycoon.

389
0:12:56,81 --> 0:12:58,9
Now, let's look at this.

390
0:12:58,9 --> 0:13:0,29
If we enter an era of economic downturn,

391
0:13:0,29 --> 0:13:2,99
if we enter a period of economic downturn,

392
0:13:2,99 --> 0:13:6,17
we'll find that it's not possible to attract tycoons from outside,

393
0:13:6,17 --> 0:13:8,41
and your market keeps shrinking.

394
0:13:8,41 --> 0:13:11,39
So, at this point, it's not even the impossible triangle anymore.

395
0:13:11,39 --> 0:13:15,19
It degenerates into its most dangerous or narrowest form.

396
0:13:15,19 --> 0:13:18,41
It's not about preserving any two of them.

397
0:13:18,41 --> 0:13:20,99
It requires sacrificing something else

398
0:13:20,99 --> 0:13:22,51
rather than keeping one of them

399
0:13:22,51 --> 0:13:24,37
you have to sacrifice the other two

400
0:13:24,37 --> 0:13:27,57
For instance, when my company faces a tough year

401
0:13:27,57 --> 0:13:28,73
in a downturn

402
0:13:28,73 --> 0:13:31,3
I might have to make a very tough decision

403
0:13:31,3 --> 0:13:32,86
If I want to maintain the profit margin

404
0:13:32,86 --> 0:13:34,5
I have to downsize my business

405
0:13:34,5 --> 0:13:35,54
I have to take a risk

406
0:13:35,54 --> 0:13:37,4
If I want to ensure certainty,

407
0:13:37,4 --> 0:13:39,64
I might have to sacrifice my profit margin,

408
0:13:39,64 --> 0:13:42,73
including reducing the size of my company,

409
0:13:42,73 --> 0:13:44,87
or narrowing my business scope.

410
0:13:44,87 --> 0:13:48,15
At this point, it becomes the most unbearable impossible triangle.

411
0:13:48,15 --> 0:13:50,569
This is about whether there are negative impacts outside the system,

412
0:13:50,569 --> 0:13:52,909
including the elements within your system,

413
0:13:52,909 --> 0:13:54,849
and whether the conversion efficiency has improved sufficiently.

414
0:13:54,849 --> 0:13:56,34
What was mentioned earlier is the impossible.

415
0:13:56,34 --> 0:13:58,1
Two scenarios for a triangular breakthrough

416
0:13:58,1 --> 0:13:58,92
Let me repeat that

417
0:13:58,92 --> 0:14:1,56
The first is to introduce forces from outside the system

418
0:14:1,56 --> 0:14:2,66
Resources from outside the system

419
0:14:2,66 --> 0:14:3,86
Wealthy individuals from outside the system

420
0:14:3,86 --> 0:14:6,76
The second is to enhance the conversion efficiency

421
0:14:6,76 --> 0:14:7,96
Between different elements within the system

422
0:14:7,96 --> 0:14:9,64
When your battery has a higher energy density

423
0:14:9,64 --> 0:14:11,72
You can actually use less space

424
0:14:11,72 --> 0:14:13,84
Then, to meet higher performance requirements

425
0:14:13,84 --> 0:14:14,96
Achieve longer battery life

426
0:14:14,96 --> 0:14:16,32
Wouldn't this factor be improved?

427
0:14:16,32 --> 0:14:16,86
Right?

428
0:14:16,86 --> 0:14:18,84
So, if we delve a bit deeper

429
0:14:18,84 --> 0:14:19,76
Go a level deeper

430
0:14:19,76 --> 0:14:21,5
There are two points to note

431
0:14:21,5 --> 0:14:24,78
The first point is that even if you break the impossible triangle

432
0:14:24,78 --> 0:14:26,8
This triangle still exists, in fact

433
0:14:26,8 --> 0:14:27,44
What does that mean?

434
0:14:27,44 --> 0:14:29,16
Compared to two years ago,

435
0:14:29,16 --> 0:14:32,3
it's possible that its performance, battery life, and portability have all improved.

436
0:14:32,3 --> 0:14:34,1
But for the current moment,

437
0:14:34,1 --> 0:14:37,69
for phone engineers and designers in 2025,

438
0:14:37,69 --> 0:14:39,1
with the existing technology,

439
0:14:39,1 --> 0:14:43,47
this phone still can't simultaneously maximize performance and battery life,

440
0:14:43,47 --> 0:14:45,19
as well as portability.

441
0:14:45,19 --> 0:14:47,7
And compared to Jordan and me,

442
0:14:47,7 --> 0:14:49,88
His playing time and contributions

443
0:14:49,88 --> 0:14:52,109
as well as his health, can all be better than mine

444
0:14:52,109 --> 0:14:53,569
but for himself

445
0:14:53,569 --> 0:14:56,889
if he overly focuses on one aspect

446
0:14:56,889 --> 0:14:59,529
for instance, if he wants to minimize his injury risk

447
0:14:59,529 --> 0:15:1,67
and extend his athletic career to the longest possible

448
0:15:1,67 --> 0:15:4,1
to ensure an exceptionally long career

449
0:15:4,1 --> 0:15:6,15
he wouldnât be able to play full minutes every game

450
0:15:6,15 --> 0:15:7,68
and go all out in every match

451
0:15:7,68 --> 0:15:10,26
So the impossible triangle still exists

452
0:15:10,26 --> 0:15:12,84
It's just that the current triangle has surpassed the previous one

453
0:15:12,84 --> 0:15:14,22
Its total area has expanded

454
0:15:14,22 --> 0:15:15,7
This rule still holds true

455
0:15:15,7 --> 0:15:17,28
The second point to note is

456
0:15:17,28 --> 0:15:19,48
If your approach to breaking the deadlock

457
0:15:19,48 --> 0:15:22,43
Is not about improving the conversion efficiency between different elements

458
0:15:22,43 --> 0:15:24,31
But rather you choose to break through with force

459
0:15:24,31 --> 0:15:26,39
That is, by introducing wealthy merchants from outside the system

460
0:15:26,39 --> 0:15:27,95
So let's try a different word

461
0:15:27,95 --> 0:15:29,2
A word that sounds much worse

462
0:15:29,2 --> 0:15:33,95
In fact, you're introducing a new cost that can be sacrificed

463
0:15:33,95 --> 0:15:35,79
What does a new dimension mean?

464
0:15:35,79 --> 0:15:36,67
For example, 996

465
0:15:36,67 --> 0:15:38,42
How can we understand this?

466
0:15:38,42 --> 0:15:40,9
We all know that in project management, there's a famous concept

467
0:15:40,9 --> 0:15:41,3
The impossible triangle

468
0:15:41,3 --> 0:15:42,6
It refers to scope

469
0:15:42,6 --> 0:15:43,42
Time and cost

470
0:15:43,42 --> 0:15:47,37
You can't simultaneously meet the extensive scope of this project

471
0:15:47,37 --> 0:15:49,7
And complete it very quickly

472
0:15:49,7 --> 0:15:50,45
While keeping the cost low

473
0:15:50,45 --> 0:15:53,28
But what does 996 mean

474
0:15:53,28 --> 0:15:55,88
In reality, you're introducing a new cost

475
0:15:55,88 --> 0:15:59,19
If the company doesn't care about the health of its employees

476
0:15:59,19 --> 0:16:1,31
And isn't concerned about legal risks

477
0:16:1,31 --> 0:16:4,63
You're bringing in an external force that can be sacrificed

478
0:16:4,63 --> 0:16:6,37
That is, when the employee is healthy

479
0:16:6,37 --> 0:16:9,15
Then the impossible triangle of project management is achieved

480
0:16:9,15 --> 0:16:11,43
You still give him the same amount of money for a month

481
0:16:11,43 --> 0:16:13,5
But he can do more work

482
0:16:13,5 --> 0:16:14,83
The cost would naturally decrease, right?

483
0:16:14,83 --> 0:16:17,77
Or the time for this project would be shortened, wouldn't it?

484
0:16:17,77 --> 0:16:18,75
The scope would be expanded, wouldn't it?

485
0:16:18,75 --> 0:16:19,89
Of course, you could say

486
0:16:19,89 --> 0:16:20,89
This is not from outside the system

487
0:16:20,89 --> 0:16:21,69
This is within the system.

488
0:16:21,69 --> 0:16:23,88
But the employee health introduced

489
0:16:23,88 --> 0:16:26,66
is actually outside the original company's management scope.

490
0:16:26,66 --> 0:16:29,22
And it actually has health insurance and other aspects

491
0:16:29,22 --> 0:16:30,62
to cover the cost for him.

492
0:16:30,62 --> 0:16:32,23
Or to put it more bluntly,

493
0:16:32,23 --> 0:16:34,13
he fires you at the age of 30,

494
0:16:34,13 --> 0:16:36,9
and you end up outside the system, right?

495
0:16:36,9 --> 0:16:39,85
The cost of your health won't be covered by the elements within this system.

496
0:16:39,85 --> 0:16:41,9
So he can break through

497
0:16:41,9 --> 0:16:44,5
the impossible triangle, or it's just a joke

498
0:16:44,5 --> 0:16:45,53
the impossible triangle isn't very rigorous

499
0:16:45,53 --> 0:16:47,41
If you're looking for a job

500
0:16:47,41 --> 0:16:50,23
you can't find one that pays well, has little work

501
0:16:50,23 --> 0:16:50,81
and is close to home

502
0:16:50,81 --> 0:16:51,33
right?

503
0:16:51,33 --> 0:16:53,11
Actually, some people can find such jobs

504
0:16:53,11 --> 0:16:54,67
but let's assume it's impossible

505
0:16:54,67 --> 0:16:57,83
Triangles are generally valid.

506
0:16:57,83 --> 0:16:58,93
So how do you break through?

507
0:16:58,93 --> 0:17:0,55
You can go to your dad's company.

508
0:17:0,55 --> 0:17:2,9
Your dad runs the company.

509
0:17:2,9 --> 0:17:3,78
Then you join your dad's company.

510
0:17:3,78 --> 0:17:5,38
What is the cost of this sacrifice?

511
0:17:5,38 --> 0:17:7,4
The cost is your dad's interests.

512
0:17:7,4 --> 0:17:8,92
Your dad is paying you.

513
0:17:8,92 --> 0:17:10,98
In reality, an unqualified employee is being brought in.

514
0:17:10,98 --> 0:17:12,88
And the risks for his company have increased.

515
0:17:12,88 --> 0:17:14,56
His other employees might become dissatisfied.

516
0:17:14,56 --> 0:17:16,4
Once you introduce a cost,

517
0:17:16,4 --> 0:17:17,34
the unequal triangle is broken.

518
0:17:17,34 --> 0:17:19,2
Itâs your impossible triangle thatâs broken.

519
0:17:19,2 --> 0:17:21,36
And whatâs sacrificed is the interests of your father and the company.

520
0:17:21,36 --> 0:17:24,56
So, we see the impossible N-sided shape turn into an impossible N+1-sided shape.

521
0:17:24,56 --> 0:17:26,2
To put it bluntly,

522
0:17:26,2 --> 0:17:29,44
itâs when you can introduce a new element.

523
0:17:31,8 --> 0:17:32,55
The impossible triangle can be broken

524
0:17:32,55 --> 0:17:33,95
For example, social development

525
0:17:33,95 --> 0:17:38,27
You might not be able to achieve efficiency, equity, and equality simultaneously

526
0:17:38,27 --> 0:17:38,91
Social development

527
0:17:38,91 --> 0:17:40,94
These three cannot be achieved at the same time

528
0:17:40,94 --> 0:17:44,6
But if you significantly sacrifice the environment

529
0:17:44,6 --> 0:17:45,56
If you completely disregard environmental protection

530
0:17:45,56 --> 0:17:47,82
In reality, you are borrowing from the natural system

531
0:17:47,82 --> 0:17:49,56
Borrowing from nature

532
0:17:49,56 --> 0:17:51,94
So there's a good chance you can do this well

533
0:17:51,94 --> 0:17:55,53
That's my take on the impossible triangle

534
0:17:55,53 --> 0:17:56,61
I wonder if you all got it

535
0:17:56,61 --> 0:17:59,87
I tried to explain it with the lowest possible barrier to understanding

536
0:17:59,87 --> 0:18:1,59
to get this point across

537
0:18:1,59 --> 0:18:2,21
Now that we know

538
0:18:2,21 --> 0:18:4,55
what practical implications does this have for us?

539
0:18:4,55 --> 0:18:5,67
A few things come to mind

540
0:18:5,67 --> 0:18:7,76
First, you now know

541
0:18:7,76 --> 0:18:9,86
After understanding the impossible triangle,

542
0:18:9,86 --> 0:18:11,58
you will certainly be able to grasp

543
0:18:11,58 --> 0:18:13,78
that we need to respect the objective laws

544
0:18:13,78 --> 0:18:15,46
we need to respect the second law of thermodynamics,

545
0:18:15,46 --> 0:18:18,2
we need to respect the physical laws in this physical world,

546
0:18:18,2 --> 0:18:20,8
and we also need to respect the laws of human nature,

547
0:18:20,8 --> 0:18:21,64
respect the objective laws of the industry,

548
0:18:21,64 --> 0:18:24,8
and many things cannot be achieved by brute force alone,

549
0:18:24,8 --> 0:18:25,84
within this system.

550
0:18:25,84 --> 0:18:27,4
If you donât break out of your conventional thinking,

551
0:18:27,4 --> 0:18:30,5
youâll never be able to achieve multiple goals at once.

552
0:18:30,5 --> 0:18:31,94
As for the breakthrough strategy mentioned earlier,

553
0:18:31,94 --> 0:18:32,5
itâs either through leverage,

554
0:18:32,5 --> 0:18:33,14
or through ingenuity.

555
0:18:33,14 --> 0:18:35,3
Neither of these is likely to be accomplished in the short term.

556
0:18:35,3 --> 0:18:36,8
From a short-term perspective,

557
0:18:36,8 --> 0:18:38,68
if you want to achieve something,

558
0:18:38,68 --> 0:18:40,37
you have to be willing to let go.

559
0:18:40,37 --> 0:18:42,5
You'll have to pay a certain price

560
0:18:42,5 --> 0:18:44,69
Otherwise, you might end up wanting everything

561
0:18:44,69 --> 0:18:45,89
And ultimately get nothing

562
0:18:45,89 --> 0:18:46,87
That's the first point

563
0:18:46,87 --> 0:18:49,0
It's akin to a philosophy of life

564
0:18:49,0 --> 0:18:53,19
The second point is that we shouldn't view things in isolation

565
0:18:53,19 --> 0:18:56,5
We shouldn't look at things in a fragmented way

566
0:18:56,5 --> 0:18:58,26
We should try to view things through the lens of system theory

567
0:18:58,26 --> 0:18:59,66
When examining a particular issue

568
0:18:59,66 --> 0:19:1,24
When you can actually do it,

569
0:19:1,24 --> 0:19:2,18
you have truly achieved it.

570
0:19:2,18 --> 0:19:4,58
You have mastered the field comprehensively.

571
0:19:4,58 --> 0:19:6,52
Because in complex systems, many components,

572
0:19:6,52 --> 0:19:8,48
the elements are interconnected,

573
0:19:8,48 --> 0:19:10,36
either positively or negatively.

574
0:19:10,36 --> 0:19:12,76
Each element is widely connected to others.

575
0:19:12,76 --> 0:19:14,16
Pulling one thread moves the entire body.

576
0:19:14,16 --> 0:19:18,7
So if you can adopt a holistic perspective on resource allocation,

577
0:19:18,7 --> 0:19:21,21
Not limited to just one or two costs

578
0:19:21,21 --> 0:19:24,31
But rather approach the complex system with a holistic perspective

579
0:19:24,31 --> 0:19:26,24
Only then can you possibly achieve the optimal solution

580
0:19:26,24 --> 0:19:26,64
So

581
0:19:26,64 --> 0:19:29,12
We should strive to view things through the lens of system theory

582
0:19:29,12 --> 0:19:32,32
This is also a way of thinking that many high-cognition individuals can achieve

583
0:19:32,32 --> 0:19:33,24
A thinking habit

584
0:19:33,24 --> 0:19:35,4
What is the third insight?

585
0:19:35,4 --> 0:19:35,86
Guiding consciousness

586
0:19:35,86 --> 0:19:38,78
When you look at things from a long-term perspective

587
0:19:38,78 --> 0:19:41,76
thinking about potentially dedicating ten years to it

588
0:19:41,76 --> 0:19:44,4
or even spending your entire career on this company

589
0:19:44,4 --> 0:19:46,12
then you shouldnât let your thinking be confined

590
0:19:46,12 --> 0:19:47,88
if you want to break through

591
0:19:47,88 --> 0:19:48,86
the impossible triangle

592
0:19:48,86 --> 0:19:51,38
you need to broaden your horizons to find a way out

593
0:19:51,38 --> 0:19:52,18
to find a way out

594
0:19:52,18 --> 0:19:53,14
which brings us back to what we talked about earlier

595
0:19:53,14 --> 0:19:53,98
Either break through with force

596
0:19:53,98 --> 0:19:55,71
Look for resources outside the system

597
0:19:55,71 --> 0:19:57,97
See if there are ways to get external support

598
0:19:57,97 --> 0:20:0,7
What is actually more encouraged is

599
0:20:0,7 --> 0:20:3,76
To explore the possibility of advancing through technological evolution

600
0:20:3,76 --> 0:20:5,47
Through the iteration of methodologies

601
0:20:5,47 --> 0:20:7,55
By enhancing your management skills

602
0:20:7,55 --> 0:20:9,7
Or improving your management capabilities

603
0:20:9,7 --> 0:20:12,79
And also by boosting the system through institutional innovation

604
0:20:12,79 --> 0:20:14,55
The efficiency of transformation between different elements

605
0:20:14,55 --> 0:20:17,11
And on a longer timescale

606
0:20:17,11 --> 0:20:20,81
While optimizing the interactions between the various components of the system

607
0:20:20,81 --> 0:20:21,71
The final point

608
0:20:21,71 --> 0:20:24,7
Actually, it reminds me of our ancient paintings

609
0:20:24,7 --> 0:20:26,789
Or some ancient wisdom in daily life

610
0:20:26,789 --> 0:20:28,569
Using an ancient perspective to view the world

611
0:20:28,569 --> 0:20:30,3
Promoting the principle of moderation, right?

612
0:20:30,3 --> 0:20:32,6
If you look at it from the perspective of the impossible triangle

613
0:20:32,6 --> 0:20:33,1
It does make some sense.

614
0:20:33,1 --> 0:20:33,8
Why is that?

615
0:20:33,8 --> 0:20:35,7
Because, first of all, when this system exists,

616
0:20:35,7 --> 0:20:36,6
It's impossible,

617
0:20:36,6 --> 0:20:40,19
when a triangle has several mutually negative factors,

618
0:20:40,19 --> 0:20:42,49
if you forcefully increase one of the metrics,

619
0:20:42,49 --> 0:20:44,88
if you insist on pursuing an extreme value in one area,

620
0:20:44,88 --> 0:20:46,34
it could end up being counterproductive.

621
0:20:46,34 --> 0:20:50,3
Because when we look at a triangle and see it can achieve such a state,

622
0:20:50,3 --> 0:20:51,23
It might have the largest area

623
0:20:51,23 --> 0:20:52,96
If the sides are of fixed length

624
0:20:52,96 --> 0:20:55,32
If you forcibly increase one side

625
0:20:55,32 --> 0:20:57,6
It will turn into a narrow triangle with less area

626
0:20:57,6 --> 0:20:58,62
There could be a loss

627
0:20:58,62 --> 0:21:0,88
For example, the more money and less work we talked about earlier

628
0:21:0,88 --> 0:21:1,58
Being close to home

629
0:21:1,58 --> 0:21:3,4
If we look at it from this perspective

630
0:21:3,4 --> 0:21:6,14
When can I achieve the maximum area

631
0:21:6,14 --> 0:21:8,16
That is, your job satisfaction

632
0:21:8,16 --> 0:21:9,82
or the overall benefits of your job

633
0:21:9,82 --> 0:21:11,84
which means finding a job where the pay isn't too low

634
0:21:11,84 --> 0:21:12,98
and it's not too far from home

635
0:21:12,98 --> 0:21:14,82
with a moderate amount of overtime

636
0:21:14,82 --> 0:21:16,1
or working hours

637
0:21:16,1 --> 0:21:18,4
where the level of effort is manageable

638
0:21:18,4 --> 0:21:19,34
This is the first point

639
0:21:19,34 --> 0:21:22,38
which sometimes refers to the total area

640
0:21:22,38 --> 0:21:25,56
From the perspective of overall happiness or total benefits,

641
0:21:25,56 --> 0:21:26,969
the middle way makes sense.

642
0:21:26,969 --> 0:21:30,329
Another point is when you're not using the approach of outsmarting the situation,

643
0:21:30,329 --> 0:21:31,809
but rather the approach of improving efficiency.

644
0:21:31,809 --> 0:21:35,22
If you constantly borrow from outside the system, like from wealthy merchants,

645
0:21:35,22 --> 0:21:38,44
you might actually, on a larger scale,

646
0:21:38,44 --> 0:21:40,72
be increasing the fragility of the entire matter,

647
0:21:40,72 --> 0:21:44,15
or raising the overall risk in your environment.

648
0:21:44,15 --> 0:21:46,3
For example, let's go back to that point I mentioned earlier.

649
0:21:46,3 --> 0:21:46,75
Right?

650
0:21:46,75 --> 0:21:47,63
The 996 work schedule

651
0:21:47,63 --> 0:21:49,99
When a project's scope

652
0:21:49,99 --> 0:21:52,39
time and cost form an impossible triangle

653
0:21:52,39 --> 0:21:53,659
if you want to break through it

654
0:21:53,659 --> 0:21:55,719
you can sacrifice your employees' health, right?

655
0:21:55,719 --> 0:21:57,239
sacrificing employees' health

656
0:21:57,239 --> 0:21:59,839
on the surface it might not seem like a cost you bear

657
0:21:59,839 --> 0:22:3,27
but it also damages the project itself

658
0:22:3,27 --> 0:22:4,63
There's a possible error rate.

659
0:22:4,63 --> 0:22:6,47
Due to a decline in everyone's energy.

660
0:22:6,47 --> 0:22:8,56
If everyone's focus drops,

661
0:22:8,56 --> 0:22:10,78
Long-term 996 work hours might cause your project

662
0:22:10,78 --> 0:22:11,92
To have continuous errors.

663
0:22:11,92 --> 0:22:14,9
Additionally, innovation capabilities might decline.

664
0:22:14,9 --> 0:22:18,1
Moreover, your HR employer brand might suffer.

665
0:22:18,1 --> 0:22:20,31
Meaning, people will know you as a notorious

666
0:22:20,31 --> 0:22:22,77
Company that doesn't care about employee health.

667
0:22:22,77 --> 0:22:25,19
So, as we mentioned earlier, social development, right?

668
0:22:25,19 --> 0:22:26,45
Efficiency, fairness, and equality,

669
0:22:26,45 --> 0:22:28,88
Or something like growth rates,

670
0:22:30,3 --> 0:22:31,98
If you can't achieve them all at the same time,

671
0:22:31,98 --> 0:22:33,8
You might sacrifice environmental protection,

672
0:22:33,8 --> 0:22:36,12
You might do this by damaging the environment,

673
0:22:36,12 --> 0:22:38,24
But in a larger system perspective,

674
0:22:38,24 --> 0:22:40,56
That is, not confining this system to society alone,

675
0:22:40,56 --> 0:22:42,66
But also including nature within it,

676
0:22:42,66 --> 0:22:46,22
Actually, you are overextending your country's development potential.

677
0:22:46,22 --> 0:22:48,6
You are overextending the health of the overall environment.

678
0:22:48,6 --> 0:22:52,25
And you might invite some uncontrollable systemic risks.

679
0:22:52,25 --> 0:22:55,41
So I think the principle of moderation has its merits.

680
0:22:55,41 --> 0:22:57,75
However, moderation is not an absolute truth.

681
0:22:57,75 --> 0:22:58,47
Why is that?

682
0:22:58,47 --> 0:23:0,57
There are also two opposing arguments.

683
0:23:0,57 --> 0:23:2,53
The first argument is about life and society.

684
0:23:2,53 --> 0:23:5,3
Sometimes, you have to make some seemingly unreasonable choices.

685
0:23:5,3 --> 0:23:5,59
Why is that?

686
0:23:5,59 --> 0:23:7,59
Because you're not the only person in this world.

687
0:23:7,59 --> 0:23:10,3
Sometimes you need to work hard for others.

688
0:23:10,3 --> 0:23:12,32
Or sometimes time doesnât wait for anyone.

689
0:23:12,32 --> 0:23:14,66
You have to strive for a specific window of time.

690
0:23:14,66 --> 0:23:16,4
Once that window passes,

691
0:23:16,4 --> 0:23:18,6
the opportunity is gone.

692
0:23:18,6 --> 0:23:20,6
The likelihood of achieving your goal will significantly decrease.

693
0:23:20,6 --> 0:23:23,8
For instance, when it comes to choosing a job.

694
0:23:23,8 --> 0:23:26,75
If we consider a job's salary,

695
0:23:26,75 --> 0:23:30,29
promotion opportunities, and working hours as an impossible

696
0:23:30,29 --> 0:23:30,93
triangle,

697
0:23:30,93 --> 0:23:32,1
it often plays out this way.

698
0:23:32,1 --> 0:23:33,38
As I mentioned earlier,

699
0:23:33,38 --> 0:23:36,16
if you approach it with a more moderate and reasonable method,

700
0:23:36,16 --> 0:23:38,48
by considering the marginal cost,

701
0:23:38,48 --> 0:23:40,64
you should look for promotion opportunities,

702
0:23:40,64 --> 0:23:42,77
where the salary is also decent.

703
0:23:42,77 --> 0:23:44,85
Then, jobs with not too long overtime hours

704
0:23:44,85 --> 0:23:46,41
But often that's not the case

705
0:23:46,41 --> 0:23:48,81
For instance, when you have a mortgage

706
0:23:48,81 --> 0:23:51,96
Or when your small family is striving for something

707
0:23:51,96 --> 0:23:53,62
At such times, the pressure on your cash flow is significant

708
0:23:53,62 --> 0:23:56,3
So you might need to prioritize securing your salary

709
0:23:56,3 --> 0:24:0,7
For which you might end up taking a job with limited promotion prospects

710
0:24:0,7 --> 0:24:1,96
But pays you a decent amount now

711
0:24:1,96 --> 0:24:5,2
And involves a high number of working hours

712
0:24:5,2 --> 0:24:8,0
At this point, you don't need to worry about marginal costs.

713
0:24:8,0 --> 0:24:9,94
Instead, what you need to do is focus on the present moment.

714
0:24:9,94 --> 0:24:13,18
You should meet the needs of this stage of your life.

715
0:24:13,18 --> 0:24:15,16
Another point is, for example,

716
0:24:15,16 --> 0:24:17,56
When you graduate at 22,

717
0:24:17,56 --> 0:24:19,94
you don't have the pressure of a family, right?

718
0:24:19,94 --> 0:24:21,36
And you are young,

719
0:24:21,36 --> 0:24:22,679
your energy is still abundant.

720
0:24:22,679 --> 0:24:24,359
To put it bluntly,

721
0:24:24,359 --> 0:24:26,359
You might have to pay a certain health cost

722
0:24:26,359 --> 0:24:29,73
In that case, your optimal solution might be

723
0:24:29,73 --> 0:24:32,95
I'm aiming for promotion opportunities or a faster promotion track

724
0:24:32,95 --> 0:24:34,889
And I'm willing to sacrifice my salary

725
0:24:34,889 --> 0:24:37,29
And my labor market

726
0:24:37,29 --> 0:24:40,129
I can take a job with a very promising future

727
0:24:40,129 --> 0:24:41,589
Listening to the grand plans my boss paints

728
0:24:41,589 --> 0:24:44,19
And then accept the current situation where

729
0:24:44,19 --> 0:24:45,15
The salary is not very high

730
0:24:45,15 --> 0:24:46,75
And I have to work overtime every day

731
0:24:46,75 --> 0:24:49,8
Life and society are sometimes like this

732
0:24:49,8 --> 0:24:50,96
We need to ignore marginal benefits

733
0:24:50,96 --> 0:24:55,46
And focus on elevating one particular curve at a certain stage

734
0:24:55,46 --> 0:24:57,9
To achieve what I want at this stage

735
0:24:57,9 --> 0:24:59,84
Because opportunities are fleeting

736
0:24:59,84 --> 0:25:0,82
Another point is

737
0:25:0,82 --> 0:25:3,86
Why the middle way is not always right

738
0:25:3,86 --> 0:25:6,22
The middle way suggests that

739
0:25:6,22 --> 0:25:8,69
In ancient times, the pie couldn't be made very big

740
0:25:8,69 --> 0:25:9,53
In an agrarian society

741
0:25:9,53 --> 0:25:11,67
Technology was not the primary productive force

742
0:25:11,67 --> 0:25:13,19
Human labor was the primary productive force

743
0:25:13,19 --> 0:25:14,75
And there was no globalization

744
0:25:14,75 --> 0:25:17,12
At that time, it was hard to find wealthy merchants outside the system

745
0:25:17,12 --> 0:25:19,64
And you couldn't quickly improve

746
0:25:19,64 --> 0:25:21,28
The conversion efficiency between different elements

747
0:25:21,28 --> 0:25:23,45
Scientific development back then might have relied on luck

748
0:25:23,45 --> 0:25:26,85
Rather than a country's regular R&D investment

749
0:25:26,85 --> 0:25:29,6
Steadily producing scientific research results

750
0:25:29,6 --> 0:25:30,8
But things are different now

751
0:25:30,8 --> 0:25:31,22
We live in a modern society

752
0:25:31,22 --> 0:25:32,36
In modern society

753
0:25:32,36 --> 0:25:33,64
Whether you are a country

754
0:25:33,64 --> 0:25:35,41
A company

755
0:25:35,41 --> 0:25:36,49
Or an individual

756
0:25:36,49 --> 0:25:40,9
We can use routine and institutionalized methodologies

757
0:25:40,9 --> 0:25:42,77
To steadily enhance our capabilities

758
0:25:42,77 --> 0:25:44,49
To conduct R&D

759
0:25:44,49 --> 0:25:45,97
To iterate on methodologies

760
0:25:45,97 --> 0:25:48,38
To continuously fill information gaps

761
0:25:48,38 --> 0:25:50,84
And to constantly improve your own abilities

762
0:25:50,84 --> 0:25:52,54
Now we have various methods

763
0:25:52,54 --> 0:25:54,42
Various tools to achieve this

764
0:25:54,42 --> 0:25:56,5
So you don't need to think

765
0:25:56,5 --> 0:25:58,42
I need to hold back

766
0:25:58,42 --> 0:25:59,4
It's good enough

767
0:25:59,4 --> 0:26:1,56
I don't need to pursue the maximum benefit

768
0:26:1,56 --> 0:26:4,54
Actually, people with this mindset often lose out

769
0:26:4,54 --> 0:26:5,86
You need to see that

770
0:26:5,86 --> 0:26:8,54
Modern society provides you with all sorts of tools

771
0:26:8,54 --> 0:26:10,58
Gives you ample ways

772
0:26:10,58 --> 0:26:13,13
To break through the impossible triangle in different fields

773
0:26:13,13 --> 0:26:13,69
So

774
0:26:13,69 --> 0:26:17,169
I think a modern person should not limit themselves to a certain predicament

775
0:26:17,169 --> 0:26:20,269
But should always look beyond the system

776
0:26:20,269 --> 0:26:23,16
Is there any room for improvement

777
0:26:23,16 --> 0:26:24,78
Is there any potential for enhancement

778
0:26:24,78 --> 0:26:26,26
Rather than thinking like the ancients

779
0:26:26,26 --> 0:26:28,74
It's good enough

780
0:26:28,74 --> 0:26:29,95
People shouldn't have too many desires

781
0:26:29,95 --> 0:26:32,49
People shouldn't go against nature

782
0:26:32,49 --> 0:26:35,0
They should respect the way of nature

783
0:26:35,0 --> 0:26:36,7
That time is long gone

784
0:26:36,7 --> 0:26:38,1
We have the potential to make better choices

785
0:26:38,1 --> 0:26:40,44
Alright, I'm Lao Jiang

786
0:26:40,44 --> 0:26:42,23
I'm an UPloader who likes to ponder things

787
0:26:42,23 --> 0:26:43,23
And share my thoughts and ideas

788
0:26:43,23 --> 0:26:46,88
This is actually a rather spontaneous topic

789
0:26:46,88 --> 0:26:50,3
It's been on my mind for some time

790
0:26:50,3 --> 0:26:52,61
Thinking about what the impossible triangle really is

791
0:26:52,61 --> 0:26:54,55
So I decided to share some of my thoughts

792
0:26:54,55 --> 0:26:56,81
Some ideas

793
0:26:56,81 --> 0:26:57,41
And share them with you all

794
0:26:57,41 --> 0:26:58,52
