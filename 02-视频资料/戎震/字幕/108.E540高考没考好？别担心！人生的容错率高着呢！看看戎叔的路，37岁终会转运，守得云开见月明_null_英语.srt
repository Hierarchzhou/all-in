1
0:0:0,54 --> 0:0:2,46
Four updates a day!

2
0:0:2,46 --> 0:0:6,38
Welcome everyone to tonight’s bedtime chat show.

3
0:0:6,38 --> 0:0:8,32
The college entrance exam is just around the corner.

4
0:0:8,32 --> 0:0:10,34
I want to say a word to the kids.

5
0:0:10,34 --> 0:0:14,6
Life has a high tolerance for mistakes.

6
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:15,53
Don’t worry.

7
0:0:15,53 --> 0:0:18,53
Even if you don’t do well on the college entrance exam,

8
0:0:18,53 --> 0:0:20,509
you might end up retaking a year,

9
0:0:20,509 --> 0:0:22,29
or attending a junior college.

10
0:0:22,29 --> 0:0:24,349
It might not have been your first choice.

11
0:0:24,349 --> 0:0:30,73
Later on, you might have joined the military during college.

12
0:0:30,73 --> 0:0:32,659
All of these are great options.

13
0:0:32,659 --> 0:0:35,379
Or you might have chosen not to go to university.

14
0:0:35,379 --> 0:0:37,41
Perhaps you started a small business later on.

15
0:0:37,41 --> 0:0:41,61
Or you might have felt that there weren't many good choices for domestic schools after the college entrance exam.

16
0:0:41,61 --> 0:0:43,3
So you went abroad on your own.

17
0:0:43,3 --> 0:0:47,1
In short, I want to tell you that life has a very high tolerance for mistakes.

18
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:48,75
One thing you should be grateful for now is

19
0:0:48,75 --> 0:0:50,4
You're about to turn 18.

20
0:0:50,4 --> 0:0:52,6
Or maybe you already have.

21
0:0:52,6 --> 0:0:54,76
You're finally going to break free from your parents' control.

22
0:0:54,76 --> 0:0:56,52
This is something I need to teach you.

23
0:0:56,52 --> 0:1:0,66
Even after getting married, many people still haven't escaped their parents' control.

24
0:1:0,66 --> 0:1:3,16
They haven't really broken free from their parents' influence.

25
0:1:3,16 --> 0:1:5,2
If your parents' control over you

26
0:1:5,2 --> 0:1:7,12
continues well past the age of 18,

27
0:1:7,12 --> 0:1:9,44
your life could become quite bleak.

28
0:1:9,44 --> 0:1:12,1
You shouldn't let them control you either.

29
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:13,26
So, to put it this way,

30
0:1:13,26 --> 0:1:15,5
If we're talking about achieving this goal,

31
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:18,47
It might be a good idea to choose a school that's a bit further from home.

32
0:1:18,47 --> 0:1:21,55
But the decision should be based on your actual situation and that of your parents.

33
0:1:21,55 --> 0:1:23,55
How far from home should you be?

34
0:1:23,55 --> 0:1:24,86
The place where you work,

35
0:1:24,86 --> 0:1:26,28
Where you plan to settle down in the future,

36
0:1:26,28 --> 0:1:28,14
And where you're currently studying, all factor into this.

37
0:1:28,14 --> 0:1:29,22
But no matter what

38
0:1:29,22 --> 0:1:33,2
you should know that life is a vast wilderness

39
0:1:33,2 --> 0:1:33,92
a breath of the wild

40
0:1:33,92 --> 0:1:36,14
when it comes to many aspects of life like in The Legend of Zelda

41
0:1:36,14 --> 0:1:39,92
there aren’t as many things to worry about

42
0:1:39,92 --> 0:1:43,36
a lot of what you face now might seem like a matter of life and death

43
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:44,4
some people will pressure you to get married

44
0:1:44,4 --> 0:1:45,66
some will push you to have children

45
0:1:45,66 --> 0:1:46,88
and others will urge you to buy a house

46
0:1:46,88 --> 0:1:47,88
Some people will urge you to buy a car

47
0:1:47,88 --> 0:1:49,52
Some will push you to prepare for the civil service exam or postgraduate studies

48
0:1:49,52 --> 0:1:51,32
Others will pressure you to do all sorts of things

49
0:1:51,32 --> 0:1:52,62
And now, some might tell you

50
0:1:52,62 --> 0:1:55,8
This is the time to make a difference

51
0:1:55,8 --> 0:1:58,23
But back in our days, SAS

52
0:1:58,23 --> 0:1:59,99
During the SARS outbreak

53
0:1:59,99 --> 0:2:2,43
I took the college entrance exam that year

54
0:2:2,43 --> 0:2:4,49
Actually, I scored pretty high on my first mock exam

55
0:2:4,49 --> 0:2:6,9
But by the time of the second mock exam, it was already the holiday season.

56
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:7,86
Once the holiday started,

57
0:2:7,86 --> 0:2:9,3
I just let myself go.

58
0:2:9,3 --> 0:2:10,18
I bought a PS2,

59
0:2:10,18 --> 0:2:12,38
and I played it non-stop for a few months.

60
0:2:12,38 --> 0:2:13,38
Then I suddenly realized,

61
0:2:13,38 --> 0:2:14,5
there was still the college entrance exam to worry about.

62
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:15,92
In the end, I only got into a second-tier university.

63
0:2:15,92 --> 0:2:17,11
I didn’t do as well as I had hoped.

64
0:2:17,11 --> 0:2:18,93
But let's go back to that.

65
0:2:18,93 --> 0:2:20,37
I'm just not cut out for science.

66
0:2:20,37 --> 0:2:22,69
Because my math and physics,

67
0:2:22,69 --> 0:2:24,65
chemistry and biology were really poor.

68
0:2:24,65 --> 0:2:26,94
I should have gone for the humanities.

69
0:2:27,22 --> 0:2:28,76
Ah, that's another story.

70
0:2:28,76 --> 0:2:33,19
But I ended up studying humanities when I was in my late twenties.

71
0:2:33,19 --> 0:2:34,579
I've always wanted to study acting.

72
0:2:34,579 --> 0:2:36,779
I started learning acting when I was in my mid-twenties.

73
0:2:36,779 --> 0:2:38,299
I've always wanted to learn directing.

74
0:2:38,299 --> 0:2:40,68
I started learning when I was in my mid-twenties.

75
0:2:40,68 --> 0:2:42,54
But all of this was after college.

76
0:2:42,54 --> 0:2:44,8
Actually, I attended college four times.

77
0:2:44,8 --> 0:2:44,82
As you all know,

78
0:2:44,82 --> 0:2:48,73
I'm the type who puts a lot of faith in academic credentials.

79
0:2:48,73 --> 0:2:50,79
But what did those credentials ultimately bring me?

80
0:2:50,79 --> 0:2:52,71
Nothing more than a few wasted years of my youth,

81
0:2:52,71 --> 0:2:54,269
and a bit more money spent.

82
0:2:54,269 --> 0:2:56,349
I didn't just spend a little money

83
0:2:56,349 --> 0:2:57,829
I wasted many years of my youth

84
0:2:57,829 --> 0:3:1,11
In my early twenties, I mostly spent time overseas

85
0:3:1,11 --> 0:3:2,83
unlike others who could still focus on their careers

86
0:3:2,83 --> 0:3:3,73
or even get fired

87
0:3:3,73 --> 0:3:6,3
so everyone has their own way of living

88
0:3:6,3 --> 0:3:7,62
everyone has their own path

89
0:3:7,62 --> 0:3:9,9
many people say when you're young

90
0:3:9,9 --> 0:3:12,24
you should aim to make your first fortune by 30

91
0:3:12,24 --> 0:3:13,58
I feel like I've failed in life

92
0:3:13,58 --> 0:3:16,73
So, everyone defines success and failure differently

93
0:3:16,73 --> 0:3:18,45
I have a lot of geniuses around me

94
0:3:19,81 --> 0:3:23,669
Many of these geniuses made over a hundred million by the age of 30

95
0:3:23,669 --> 0:3:25,269
Some even had their companies listed on the stock market before turning 30

96
0:3:25,269 --> 0:3:26,3
There really are people like that

97
0:3:26,3 --> 0:3:27,94
I know a lot of people

98
0:3:27,94 --> 0:3:28,9
They are exactly like that

99
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:30,2
But I'm not

100
0:3:31,6 --> 0:3:32,9
I'm not a genius

101
0:3:33,6 --> 0:3:37,73
I only really turned my luck around at 37

102
0:3:37,73 --> 0:3:39,61
What was my life before 37?

103
0:3:39,61 --> 0:3:40,39
Right?

104
0:3:40,39 --> 0:3:41,41
When I was in my twenties

105
0:3:41,41 --> 0:3:42,93
Wasn't I valuable in my teens?

106
0:3:42,93 --> 0:3:45,96
No, I wasn't born 37 years old

107
0:3:45,96 --> 0:3:47,43
I was definitely something

108
0:3:47,43 --> 0:3:49,23
It was only later that I became successful

109
0:3:49,23 --> 0:3:50,99
Those who become great at the age of 40

110
0:3:50,99 --> 0:3:52,59
Isn't that true for Sōun

111
0:3:52,59 --> 0:3:54,25
Liu Bang was 48

112
0:3:54,25 --> 0:3:56,17
Still watching dogs fight at 47

113
0:3:56,17 --> 0:3:57,23
Only started his rebellion at 48

114
0:3:57,23 --> 0:3:57,69
Right?

115
0:3:57,69 --> 0:3:59,23
Early in the Northern Dynasty, also 48

116
0:3:59,23 --> 0:4:0,89
Many people say 48 is

117
0:4:0,89 --> 0:4:3,795
Actually a magical age, still a time to strive

118
0:4:3,82 --> 0:4:5,72
Everyone has a different lifespan.

119
0:4:5,72 --> 0:4:7,64
Speaking of the future at this point in time,

120
0:4:7,64 --> 0:4:9,62
When you are in your 20s or 30s,

121
0:4:9,62 --> 0:4:13,9
You will witness many of your classmates passing away.

122
0:4:13,9 --> 0:4:14,81
It's also possible that this process could be your own.

123
0:4:14,81 --> 0:4:16,36
But to put it another way,

124
0:4:16,36 --> 0:4:18,1
I hope it won't be you.

125
0:4:18,1 --> 0:4:21,56
I wish everyone watching this video a long life.

126
0:4:21,81 --> 0:4:24,11
You will come to understand life and death.

127
0:4:24,11 --> 0:4:24,69
So many things

128
0:4:24,69 --> 0:4:25,78
you might wonder

129
0:4:25,78 --> 0:4:28,54
what's the point of striving for them in my daily life?

130
0:4:28,54 --> 0:4:29,74
It seems meaningless

131
0:4:29,74 --> 0:4:32,26
The joy in life is defined by oneself

132
0:4:32,26 --> 0:4:36,6
Actually, what your cyber mentor said isn’t very meaningful either

133
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:37,9
He suggested you should save money

134
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:40,44
So you can use that money to start a business

135
0:4:40,44 --> 0:4:42,95
Use that money to eventually quit your job

136
0:4:42,95 --> 0:4:44,63
But when it comes to these things,

137
0:4:44,63 --> 0:4:46,43
if your lifespan isn't that long,

138
0:4:46,43 --> 0:4:48,67
why bother worrying about them?

139
0:4:48,67 --> 0:4:50,55
So, while we're alive,

140
0:4:50,55 --> 0:4:52,35
a lot of things are subjective,

141
0:4:52,35 --> 0:4:55,84
and many things are not clear to you right now,

142
0:4:55,84 --> 0:4:59,13
because all you need to do is live each day to the fullest,

143
0:4:59,13 --> 0:5:0,97
the youth you have now,

144
0:5:0,97 --> 0:5:5,9
you'll dream of or recall many times in the future.

145
0:5:5,9 --> 0:5:8,65
The dreams I have most often now are still about being back in my senior year of high school.

146
0:5:8,65 --> 0:5:11,3
It's not because I did poorly on my college entrance exam.

147
0:5:11,3 --> 0:5:13,49
I didn't keep regretting it for a long time.

148
0:5:13,49 --> 0:5:16,6
Rather, that period was meaningful to me.

149
0:5:16,6 --> 0:5:18,12
The time as a high school student,

150
0:5:18,12 --> 0:5:19,58
the time as a middle school student,

151
0:5:19,58 --> 0:5:22,4
were all important stages in my life.

152
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:24,1
I've been a college student four times.

153
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:27,16
Being a college student four times in three countries has been a lot of fun.

154
0:5:27,16 --> 0:5:29,46
But later, I went back for further studies.

155
0:5:31,0 --> 0:5:32,32
I took additional courses at the Beijing Film Academy.

156
0:5:32,32 --> 0:5:33,3
So, when it comes to that,

157
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:34,4
To be honest,

158
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:38,56
I have six alma maters, so what’s the big deal?

159
0:5:38,56 --> 0:5:39,4
More skills never hurt anyone.

160
0:5:39,4 --> 0:5:40,52
I’m still learning now,

161
0:5:40,52 --> 0:5:41,52
I’m currently studying Japanese,

162
0:5:41,52 --> 0:5:42,22
and Russian.

163
0:5:42,22 --> 0:5:42,93
Is that right?

164
0:5:42,93 --> 0:5:44,55
I'm still improving my French.

165
0:5:44,55 --> 0:5:47,45
I also practice my English almost every day in this process.

166
0:5:47,45 --> 0:5:48,73
So it's never too old to learn.

167
0:5:48,73 --> 0:5:49,5
Why?

168
0:5:49,5 --> 0:5:50,24
Because I don't have to go to work now.

169
0:5:50,24 --> 0:5:52,92
Now I can manage my time and money freely.

170
0:5:52,92 --> 0:5:54,33
That's the kind of state I'm in.

171
0:5:54,33 --> 0:5:58,31
So you might enter this state a bit earlier than me.

172
0:5:58,31 --> 0:5:59,69
Or you might reach this stage after retirement.

173
0:5:59,69 --> 0:6:1,41
So, don’t compare your life with others.

174
0:6:1,41 --> 0:6:4,68
Comparison is the thief of joy.

175
0:6:4,68 --> 0:6:8,2
Comparison steals happiness.

176
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:10,88
Life in this world for Chinese people,

177
0:6:10,88 --> 0:6:13,36
is often made difficult by two things:

178
0:6:13,36 --> 0:6:15,2
One is the pressure of oppressive education.

179
0:6:15,2 --> 0:6:18,26
Actually, the two most difficult things are, uh,

180
0:6:18,26 --> 0:6:20,4
One is the so-called pressure-cooker education.

181
0:6:20,4 --> 0:6:21,88
Parents use a suppressive education style out of fear that you might become arrogant

182
0:6:21,88 --> 0:6:23,16
It's really scary

183
0:6:23,16 --> 0:6:28,32
The second point is about comparison and competition

184
0:6:28,32 --> 0:6:33,18
There's a very strong competitive mindset when comparing with others

185
0:6:33,18 --> 0:6:35,26
But this competitive mindset

186
0:6:35,26 --> 0:6:36,5
After so many years of schooling

187
0:6:36,5 --> 0:6:38,11
They will definitely instill this in you

188
0:6:38,11 --> 0:6:40,35
In reality, others can get into big companies

189
0:6:40,35 --> 0:6:40,87
But you can't

190
0:6:40,87 --> 0:6:41,63
Others can get into Tsinghua University

191
0:6:41,63 --> 0:6:43,7
but you can't. Others can get a master's degree

192
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:44,75
but you can't. Others can go abroad

193
0:6:44,75 --> 0:6:45,65
but you can't.

194
0:6:45,65 --> 0:6:46,79
Others have gotten married

195
0:6:46,79 --> 0:6:47,66
but you can't.

196
0:6:47,66 --> 0:6:49,22
So when it comes to many things

197
0:6:49,22 --> 0:6:52,38
but that doesn't necessarily mean they are truly happy with what they have

198
0:6:52,38 --> 0:6:53,88
I have been married.

199
0:6:53,88 --> 0:6:55,62
I've been abroad.

200
0:6:55,62 --> 0:6:56,38
Right?

201
0:6:56,38 --> 0:6:58,92
Was preparing for the postgraduate exam joyful?

202
0:6:59,16 --> 0:7:2,53
Only the moment of getting admitted and the moment of graduation were joyful.

203
0:7:2,53 --> 0:7:5,41
Only the moment of getting married and the moment of getting divorced were joyful.

204
0:7:6,31 --> 0:7:9,83
Only the moment of leaving and the moment of returning were joyful.

205
0:7:9,83 --> 0:7:12,9
Many things are like thinking the grass is always greener on the other side.

206
0:7:12,9 --> 0:7:13,83
So these things don't really matter.

207
0:7:13,83 --> 0:7:15,49
Life is the breath of the wild.

208
0:7:15,49 --> 0:7:19,55
There are so many choices for free activities and actions.

209
0:7:19,55 --> 0:7:22,79
And every experience you have in this city,

210
0:7:22,79 --> 0:7:25,25
simply can't be had simultaneously in another city.

211
0:7:25,25 --> 0:7:26,73
Every day is new.

212
0:7:26,73 --> 0:7:29,65
Every day, in every city around the world, there are new stories.

213
0:7:29,65 --> 0:7:31,12
New things are happening.

214
0:7:31,12 --> 0:7:33,92
As an important experiencer of life,

215
0:7:33,92 --> 0:7:35,48
you are here to experience it.

216
0:7:35,48 --> 0:7:37,92
You're not here to change the entire world.

217
0:7:37,92 --> 0:7:40,8
You're not here to conquer everything.

218
0:7:40,8 --> 0:7:43,52
Your goal is simply to live here for a while.

219
0:7:43,52 --> 0:7:45,23
And that's it.

220
0:7:45,23 --> 0:7:46,99
It's just that simple.

221
0:7:46,99 --> 0:7:48,73
So don't overcomplicate it.

222
0:7:48,73 --> 0:7:51,46
People have all sorts of reasons.

223
0:7:51,46 --> 0:7:52,94
Society has all sorts of reasons.

224
0:7:52,94 --> 0:7:55,26
They need you to do this or that.

225
0:7:55,26 --> 0:7:57,6
But you don't have to do this or that.

226
0:7:57,6 --> 0:8:0,169
So, there's no established practice for humans, really.

227
0:8:0,169 --> 0:8:1,81
There are things that must be accomplished, though.

228
0:8:1,81 --> 0:8:4,11
Actually, when you think about it, this world itself...

229
0:8:4,11 --> 0:8:6,13
The existence of civilization might be meaningless.

230
0:8:6,13 --> 0:8:8,26
I'm not talking about agnostics.

231
0:8:8,26 --> 0:8:10,1
I'm not talking about nihilists either.

232
0:8:10,1 --> 0:8:11,97
But let me tell you something practical, May.

233
0:8:11,97 --> 0:8:13,91
The practical truth is that it's meaningless.

234
0:8:13,91 --> 0:8:16,43
Names can be given, but true names cannot be named.

235
0:8:16,43 --> 0:8:17,99
People have given it meaning

236
0:8:17,99 --> 0:8:19,65
People defined this function

237
0:8:19,65 --> 0:8:20,83
People defined this event

238
0:8:20,83 --> 0:8:22,15
What it means to live right

239
0:8:22,15 --> 0:8:23,51
What it means to live wrong

240
0:8:23,51 --> 0:8:24,71
The people around you

241
0:8:24,71 --> 0:8:26,83
Your so-called mentors

242
0:8:26,83 --> 0:8:28,15
So-called authorities

243
0:8:28,15 --> 0:8:29,13
So-called experts

244
0:8:29,13 --> 0:8:30,83
They're all just amateur groups, really.

245
0:8:30,83 --> 0:8:31,99
Decades ago, they themselves

246
0:8:31,99 --> 0:8:34,86
were just young people like you.

247
0:8:34,86 --> 0:8:36,62
Look at the young people in their twenties now,

248
0:8:36,62 --> 0:8:37,46
in my eyes,

249
0:8:37,46 --> 0:8:39,14
weren't they crawling around on the ground before they turned twenty?

250
0:8:39,14 --> 0:8:39,42
Right?

251
0:8:39,42 --> 0:8:40,6
They were still kids.

252
0:8:40,6 --> 0:8:40,38
Right?

253
0:8:40,38 --> 0:8:42,78
Now, one by one, they're putting on suits

254
0:8:42,78 --> 0:8:44,98
rushing to catch the subway

255
0:8:44,98 --> 0:8:48,3
are they also joining the painless tide of the crowd

256
0:8:48,3 --> 0:8:50,97
weaving through the office buildings

257
0:8:50,97 --> 0:8:51,71
That's right

258
0:8:51,71 --> 0:8:55,12
So you'll notice that society has a way of guiding you

259
0:8:55,12 --> 0:8:56,4
of setting expectations for you

260
0:8:56,4 --> 0:8:58,52
of molding you through a process

261
0:8:58,52 --> 0:9:0,88
you, as part of the education system

262
0:9:0,88 --> 0:9:2,46
You're also part of the crowd.

263
0:9:2,46 --> 0:9:5,6
So before you fully understand how this system works,

264
0:9:5,6 --> 0:9:6,86
you can't escape from it.

265
0:9:6,86 --> 0:9:9,34
Even when you think you've managed to break free one day,

266
0:9:9,34 --> 0:9:11,76
you might not truly be out of it.

267
0:9:11,76 --> 0:9:13,98
It's just that your mind has been liberated.

268
0:9:13,98 --> 0:9:15,5
Many things are like this.

269
0:9:15,5 --> 0:9:18,78
That's why in society, many people pursue different things,

270
0:9:18,78 --> 0:9:20,14
power, wealth, and fame.

271
0:9:20,14 --> 0:9:21,42
Pursuing the meaning of life

272
0:9:21,42 --> 0:9:22,34
Pursuing the wilderness

273
0:9:22,34 --> 0:9:23,7
Pursuing poetry and distant lands

274
0:9:23,7 --> 0:9:25,11
Pursuing anything is acceptable

275
0:9:25,11 --> 0:9:27,23
But every choice comes with its own price

276
0:9:27,23 --> 0:9:28,7
That's just how it is

277
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:30,59
So if life were to end after the college entrance exam

278
0:9:30,59 --> 0:9:31,71
It would be too simple

279
0:9:31,71 --> 0:9:34,43
School teachers would definitely tell you that

280
0:9:34,43 --> 0:9:36,23
Your parents would definitely say this to you.

281
0:9:36,23 --> 0:9:38,53
But what kind of life do they understand?

282
0:9:38,53 --> 0:9:40,8
Getting admitted to Tsinghua or Peking University, huh?

283
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:42,9
Securing a green card in the U.S., huh?

284
0:9:42,9 --> 0:9:45,19
Or getting a master’s degree, hm?

285
0:9:45,19 --> 0:9:46,67
Or a doctoral degree.

286
0:9:46,67 --> 0:9:48,63
Then making ten million.

287
0:9:48,63 --> 0:9:49,71
Then a hundred million.

288
0:9:49,71 --> 0:9:50,83
Then a billion.

289
0:9:50,83 --> 0:9:53,349
Grow four more kidneys upon re-listing

290
0:9:53,349 --> 0:9:54,36
Is that so?

291
0:9:54,36 --> 0:9:56,16
What exactly is it that life gives us?

292
0:9:56,16 --> 0:9:57,42
True success

293
0:9:57,42 --> 0:9:59,6
What should be the goal of life?

294
0:9:59,6 --> 0:10:0,0
To achieve this goal

295
0:10:0,0 --> 0:10:1,22
And then just die?

296
0:10:1,22 --> 0:10:3,49
What comes after achieving this goal?

297
0:10:3,49 --> 0:10:5,61
Are people who achieve these goals really happy?

298
0:10:5,61 --> 0:10:7,95
What if I set my goals a bit lower?

299
0:10:7,95 --> 0:10:10,35
So what if I achieve those goals?

300
0:10:10,35 --> 0:10:12,64
What if I beat a game?

301
0:10:12,64 --> 0:10:15,82
What if I got 10 million when I cashed out today?

302
0:10:15,82 --> 0:10:17,74
It's just a bunch of numbers.

303
0:10:17,74 --> 0:10:21,27
It's just something meaningless, isn't it?

304
0:10:21,27 --> 0:10:22,57
A person holds a piece of paper.

305
0:10:22,57 --> 0:10:24,17
Holds an electronic circuit board.

306
0:10:24,17 --> 0:10:26,27
Feeling that doing this gives it meaning.

307
0:10:26,27 --> 0:10:28,9
So it's actually quite effective.

308
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:29,45
It's really ineffective.

309
0:10:29,45 --> 0:10:31,65
It's a rather boring idea.

310
0:10:31,65 --> 0:10:32,97
In many cases,

311
0:10:32,97 --> 0:10:35,93
our way of thinking doesn't really make much sense.

312
0:10:35,93 --> 0:10:37,51
So let me tell you,

313
0:10:37,87 --> 0:10:39,38
no matter how well or poorly you perform,

314
0:10:39,38 --> 0:10:40,82
life won't come to an end.

315
0:10:40,82 --> 0:10:43,4
Life will move forward at its own pace.

316
0:10:43,4 --> 0:10:45,22
Whether you like him or not

317
0:10:45,22 --> 0:10:47,38
your days still pass one by one

318
0:10:47,38 --> 0:10:50,44
the only thing that is fair to everyone in this world is time

319
0:10:50,44 --> 0:10:52,28
everything else is unfair

320
0:10:52,28 --> 0:10:54,28
there are only 24 hours in a day

321
0:10:54,28 --> 0:10:55,76
you have 24 hours even if you're swamped

322
0:10:55,76 --> 0:10:56,76
if you spend your day like me

323
0:10:56,76 --> 0:10:58,24
working late into the night still gives you 24 hours

324
0:10:58,24 --> 0:10:59,2
even if you don't sleep at all

325
0:10:59,2 --> 0:11:0,2
He also has 24 hours.

326
0:11:0,2 --> 0:11:1,28
But as long as you don’t sleep,

327
0:11:1,28 --> 0:11:3,14
your body will definitely be worn out.

328
0:11:3,14 --> 0:11:4,6
You will be extremely tired.

329
0:11:4,6 --> 0:11:7,57
So, this is the time for you to enjoy life to the fullest.

330
0:11:7,57 --> 0:11:9,17
When you’re young, you’re bound to make mistakes.

331
0:11:9,17 --> 0:11:10,65
When you’re young, you’re bound to act on impulse.

332
0:11:10,65 --> 0:11:13,46
When you’re young, you’re bound to spend a bit more.

333
0:11:13,46 --> 0:11:16,2
You can watch this video when you’re 30, it’s not too late.

334
0:11:16,2 --> 0:11:17,2
It's all good

335
0:11:17,2 --> 0:11:18,82
So no matter what

336
0:11:18,82 --> 0:11:20,5
Life isn't really defined by anything

337
0:11:20,5 --> 0:11:22,339
Things we truly did wrong

338
0:11:22,339 --> 0:11:24,959
Things that are truly worth doing

339
0:11:24,959 --> 0:11:26,92
Things we would regret not doing

340
0:11:26,92 --> 0:11:28,36
Life is all about self-definition

341
0:11:28,36 --> 0:11:30,54
Don't listen to all the talk from those who lived in the past

342
0:11:30,54 --> 0:11:32,28
Look at us, we've made it to 40

343
0:11:32,28 --> 0:11:33,5
Isn't it just like that?

344
0:11:33,5 --> 0:11:35,68
Who can have lightning under their butt?

345
0:11:35,68 --> 0:11:37,66
Who can have three heads, right?

346
0:11:37,66 --> 0:11:38,26
Right, not really.

347
0:11:38,26 --> 0:11:39,31
Truly powerful.

348
0:11:39,31 --> 0:11:40,83
People of my age,

349
0:11:40,83 --> 0:11:42,23
Some have achieved their dreams,

350
0:11:42,23 --> 0:11:43,47
Some haven't achieved their dreams,

351
0:11:43,47 --> 0:11:44,79
Aren't we all living like this?

352
0:11:44,79 --> 0:11:45,44
Is that right?

353
0:11:45,44 --> 0:11:47,74
Our skin ages day by day.

354
0:11:47,74 --> 0:11:49,34
Hair gets thinner and thinner.

355
0:11:49,34 --> 0:11:51,18
Hair grows in places where it shouldn’t.

356
0:11:51,18 --> 0:11:53,67
Things that shouldn’t harden are gradually becoming harder.

357
0:11:53,67 --> 0:11:55,51
Things that shouldn’t soften are gradually becoming softer.

358
0:11:55,51 --> 0:11:56,33
That’s how it is.

359
0:11:56,33 --> 0:11:57,63
This is the process of aging.

360
0:11:57,63 --> 0:11:59,819
After aging comes death, which is quite normal.

361
0:11:59,819 --> 0:12:1,819
But can you say that all of this is meaningless?

362
0:12:1,819 --> 0:12:3,259
I'm not saying if I live to be 80

363
0:12:3,259 --> 0:12:3,999
or 90

364
0:12:3,999 --> 0:12:5,379
that it would be the same as living to be 40 or 50

365
0:12:5,379 --> 0:12:6,459
the significance would be different

366
0:12:6,459 --> 0:12:7,6
right?

367
0:12:7,6 --> 0:12:9,66
So what is the meaning of life, really?

368
0:12:9,66 --> 0:12:11,2
No one can figure it out

369
0:12:11,2 --> 0:12:13,58
What does it mean to live your entire life?

370
0:12:13,58 --> 0:12:15,37
Only you can provide the answer.

371
0:12:15,37 --> 0:12:17,55
So you're not living just to survive.

372
0:12:17,55 --> 0:12:19,27
You're living because you're alive.

373
0:12:19,27 --> 0:12:21,59
I mean, how do I put it?

374
0:12:21,59 --> 0:12:25,83
You're not living this life just to achieve a certain outcome.

375
0:12:25,83 --> 0:12:27,31
Throughout your life,

376
0:12:27,31 --> 0:12:29,3
every moment in school,

377
0:12:29,3 --> 0:12:29,91
every single second,

378
0:12:29,91 --> 0:12:33,929
the friends you make will also be lost.

379
0:12:33,929 --> 0:12:37,5
I feel like I hardly interact with my classmates anymore.

380
0:12:37,5 --> 0:12:38,78
Although I still have friends,

381
0:12:38,78 --> 0:12:41,3
most of my friends now are from my career.

382
0:12:41,3 --> 0:12:43,74
Perhaps I’ve never had many friends to begin with,

383
0:12:43,74 --> 0:12:45,56
so I don’t really care about these things.

384
0:12:45,56 --> 0:12:46,96
But during high school,

385
0:12:46,96 --> 0:12:49,36
and college, you really valued your friends.

386
0:12:49,36 --> 0:12:52,14
You haven’t experienced enough betrayals from friends yet,

387
0:12:52,14 --> 0:12:53,42
or the mundanity that can come with friendships.

388
0:12:53,42 --> 0:12:54,96
Once you reach a certain point in time

389
0:12:54,96 --> 0:12:58,66
you'll notice that your status has risen

390
0:12:58,66 --> 0:13:0,6
while your friends remain in the same place

391
0:13:0,6 --> 0:13:1,24
and that's quite normal

392
0:13:1,24 --> 0:13:2,34
they might ask you for loans

393
0:13:2,34 --> 0:13:3,5
they might even try to steal your girlfriend

394
0:13:3,5 --> 0:13:4,91
or they might introduce you to potential girlfriends

395
0:13:4,91 --> 0:13:6,93
they'll do all sorts of things

396
0:13:6,93 --> 0:13:8,37
some might even contribute to your expenses

397
0:13:8,37 --> 0:13:10,62
Some people will cry with you

398
0:13:10,62 --> 0:13:12,58
but human nature often has two sides

399
0:13:12,58 --> 0:13:14,78
so you can't rely too much on anyone

400
0:13:14,78 --> 0:13:16,14
Sometimes that's just how it is

401
0:13:16,14 --> 0:13:17,78
So no matter what

402
0:13:17,78 --> 0:13:21,24
Life is like the breath of the wild

403
0:13:21,24 --> 0:13:22,7
You can do whatever you want

404
0:13:22,7 --> 0:13:24,1
Whatever you desire

405
0:13:24,1 --> 0:13:25,2
Or do nothing at all

406
0:13:25,2 --> 0:13:26,58
You can still do well without completing the main quests.

407
0:13:26,58 --> 0:13:28,88
You can still have a great time without doing the main quests.

408
0:13:28,88 --> 0:13:30,32
Life is like a GTA game.

409
0:13:30,32 --> 0:13:31,74
No matter how you look at it,

410
0:13:31,74 --> 0:13:33,1
it’s a massive playground.

411
0:13:33,1 --> 0:13:34,69
Just enjoy the ride.

412
0:13:34,69 --> 0:13:36,57
Regardless of the outcome,

413
0:13:36,57 --> 0:13:37,81
when it comes to life,

414
0:13:37,81 --> 0:13:39,51
the margin for error is quite high.

415
0:13:39,51 --> 0:13:41,5
You could finish junior high school

416
0:13:41,5 --> 0:13:42,45
and then go into wholesale snacks

417
0:13:42,45 --> 0:13:43,13
right?

418
0:13:43,13 --> 0:13:44,65
You could finish high school

419
0:13:44,65 --> 0:13:45,69
and then deliver food

420
0:13:45,69 --> 0:13:48,81
or you could still wholesale snacks after graduating from college

421
0:13:48,81 --> 0:13:49,69
deliver food

422
0:13:49,69 --> 0:13:51,31
or work for a moving company

423
0:13:51,31 --> 0:13:54,55
you might come back from studying abroad with nothing to show for it

424
0:13:54,55 --> 0:13:58,79
You could stay at home all night or become a delivery person.

425
0:13:58,79 --> 0:13:59,399
That’s how life goes.

426
0:13:59,399 --> 0:14:1,559
Life could mean that for the past 30 years or so,

427
0:14:1,559 --> 0:14:2,78
or even 40 years, things haven’t gone well for you,

428
0:14:2,78 --> 0:14:5,1
but suddenly, at 42, everything starts to fall into place.

429
0:14:5,1 --> 0:14:6,78
One day, you do something,

430
0:14:6,78 --> 0:14:8,6
and suddenly, everyone in the country knows who you are.

431
0:14:8,6 --> 0:14:9,99
Everyone around the world knows you.

432
0:14:9,99 --> 0:14:10,93
Anything is possible.

433
0:14:10,93 --> 0:14:12,75
So, life is full of turning points everywhere.

434
0:14:12,75 --> 0:14:14,23
And whenever you step out of the door,

435
0:14:14,23 --> 0:14:15,24
whenever you stay in,

436
0:14:15,24 --> 0:14:17,28
whoever you speak a word to,

437
0:14:17,28 --> 0:14:18,8
whoever might know you,

438
0:14:18,8 --> 0:14:22,9
that person could completely change your life.

439
0:14:22,9 --> 0:14:23,13
Marrying a different person,

440
0:14:23,13 --> 0:14:23,97
marrying someone else,

441
0:14:23,97 --> 0:14:25,5
can also change your life.

442
0:14:25,5 --> 0:14:26,49
So, when it comes to many things,

443
0:14:26,49 --> 0:14:27,97
there's no need to lay everything out at once,

444
0:14:27,97 --> 0:14:29,37
no need to reveal all the secrets,

445
0:14:29,37 --> 0:14:31,349
no need to keep predicting the future,

446
0:14:31,349 --> 0:14:32,909
as long as you don't seek predictions yourself,

447
0:14:32,909 --> 0:14:34,509
this thing will always remain in a superposition state,

448
0:14:34,509 --> 0:14:35,79
it's no big deal,

449
0:14:35,79 --> 0:14:37,67
if you're not familiar with the concept of superposition,

450
0:14:37,67 --> 0:14:42,69
then just take the college entrance exam with a relaxed attitude, it's all good.

451
0:14:42,509 --> 0:14:45,849
Some people are destined to be scientists.

452
0:14:45,849 --> 0:14:50,46
Some are destined to help us develop major national projects.

453
0:14:50,46 --> 0:14:52,16
Some are destined to be engineers.

454
0:14:52,16 --> 0:14:53,64
To build bridges and connect the sea.

455
0:14:53,64 --> 0:14:54,579
To create islands.

456
0:14:54,579 --> 0:14:56,379
Some are destined to be teachers.

457
0:14:56,379 --> 0:14:58,139
Some are destined to be doctors.

458
0:14:58,139 --> 0:14:59,579
It's all predestined.

459
0:14:59,579 --> 0:15:1,96
It's a path that is inevitably taken.

460
0:15:1,96 --> 0:15:3,78
So your destiny is not meant for these things

461
0:15:3,78 --> 0:15:5,32
Why do you have to compare yourself with others

462
0:15:5,32 --> 0:15:5,92
Right

463
0:15:5,92 --> 0:15:7,81
Everyone has their own purpose in life

464
0:15:7,81 --> 0:15:9,35
Even if you feel useless

465
0:15:9,35 --> 0:15:10,37
So what

466
0:15:10,37 --> 0:15:11,53
A scholar may be good for nothing

467
0:15:11,53 --> 0:15:12,319
Right

468
0:15:12,319 --> 0:15:13,399
It doesn’t matter

469
0:15:13,399 --> 0:15:14,919
It's not that this thing is useful

470
0:15:14,919 --> 0:15:17,79
it has so many organs in the human body

471
0:15:17,79 --> 0:15:19,31
so many branches

472
0:15:19,31 --> 0:15:20,93
which one is truly useful

473
0:15:20,93 --> 0:15:22,27
which one is truly useless

474
0:15:22,27 --> 0:15:22,95
who can we do without

475
0:15:22,95 --> 0:15:23,55
it wouldn't be right

476
0:15:23,55 --> 0:15:24,22
isn't that so

477
0:15:24,22 --> 0:15:24,94
who can we do without

478
0:15:24,94 --> 0:15:26,26
This universe isn't even complete.

479
0:15:26,26 --> 0:15:27,86
So no matter what,

480
0:15:28,14 --> 0:15:30,18
don't overthink things,

481
0:15:30,18 --> 0:15:33,22
don't dwell on anything beyond your own existence.

482
0:15:33,22 --> 0:15:36,71
Just remember that yesterday is gone for good,

483
0:15:36,71 --> 0:15:39,6
and tomorrow hasn't arrived yet.

484
0:15:39,6 --> 0:15:41,68
Just make the most of today.

485
0:15:41,68 --> 0:15:43,62
If you're happy today, then be happy.

486
0:15:43,62 --> 0:15:46,25
If you're not happy today, then that's the way it is.

487
0:15:46,25 --> 0:15:47,41
So it doesn’t matter

488
0:15:47,41 --> 0:15:48,95
Just focus on the present

489
0:15:48,95 --> 0:15:51,31
Who knows if we’ll be alive tomorrow

490
0:15:51,31 --> 0:15:53,41
So just focus on the present

491
0:15:53,41 --> 0:15:55,51
Live for today, as if there’s no tomorrow

492
0:15:55,51 --> 0:15:57,33
It’s a simple logic

493
0:15:57,33 --> 0:15:58,81
Enjoy your youth now

494
0:15:58,81 --> 0:16:0,15
Your body is still in good shape

495
0:16:0,15 --> 0:16:1,55
Go out and have fun when you can

496
0:16:1,55 --> 0:16:4,16
Don't listen to me about saving money all the time

497
0:16:4,16 --> 0:16:6,24
But you should still save money when you can

498
0:16:6,24 --> 0:16:8,12
Just don't go overboard with spending

499
0:16:8,12 --> 0:16:10,52
But you should definitely enjoy life and experience it

500
0:16:10,52 --> 0:16:11,48
You should have romantic relationships

501
0:16:11,48 --> 0:16:12,2
Right?

502
0:16:12,2 --> 0:16:13,68
It's often the case

503
0:16:13,68 --> 0:16:16,4
Most of life's experiences are gained in your twenties

504
0:16:16,4 --> 0:16:17,91
If you don't experience them in your twenties

505
0:16:17,91 --> 0:16:19,71
When you're in your thirties and married

506
0:16:19,71 --> 0:16:21,19
you'll start thinking

507
0:16:21,19 --> 0:16:22,1
about doing something different

508
0:16:22,1 --> 0:16:23,47
and go through it all over again

509
0:16:23,47 --> 0:16:24,829
this is called post-adolescent syndrome

510
0:16:24,829 --> 0:16:27,339
so you should seize the moment to explore when you have the chance

511
0:16:27,339 --> 0:16:28,459
no matter what happens

512
0:16:28,459 --> 0:16:30,739
life doesn't start on the day of your college entrance exam

513
0:16:30,739 --> 0:16:32,739
and it certainly won't end on that day either

514
0:16:32,739 --> 0:16:34,5
No matter how the exam goes

515
0:16:34,5 --> 0:16:35,19
there are always remedial options

516
0:16:35,19 --> 0:16:36,61
you can go to a junior college and then transfer to a bachelor's program

517
0:16:36,61 --> 0:16:38,3
and you can even change your major when you transfer

518
0:16:38,3 --> 0:16:38,83
right?

519
0:16:38,83 --> 0:16:40,53
There's also part-time study for transferring from a junior college to a bachelor's program

520
0:16:40,53 --> 0:16:42,26
and it won't interfere with your work

521
0:16:42,26 --> 0:16:43,78
you can join the military

522
0:16:43,78 --> 0:16:44,7
or study abroad

523
0:16:44,7 --> 0:16:45,96
or start your own business

524
0:16:45,96 --> 0:16:46,62
no matter what

525
0:16:46,62 --> 0:16:48,42
graduating from high school doesn't mean you're unintelligent

526
0:16:48,42 --> 0:16:49,2
right?

527
0:16:49,2 --> 0:16:51,46
you can do a lot of things on your own

528
0:16:51,46 --> 0:16:53,2
if you don't know how to do something

529
0:16:53,2 --> 0:16:55,19
come to Bilibili, go to the library

530
0:16:55,19 --> 0:16:56,71
there are many things you can do

531
0:16:56,71 --> 0:16:57,45
no matter what

532
0:16:57,45 --> 0:17:0,19
life is definitely not as your parents describe it

533
0:17:0,19 --> 0:17:2,23
what do they have themselves?

534
0:17:2,23 --> 0:17:5,829
many parents themselves have a low social status

535
0:17:5,829 --> 0:17:7,949
earning a fixed salary

536
0:17:7,949 --> 0:17:9,409
so they haven't achieved much

537
0:17:9,409 --> 0:17:10,249
they haven't achieved much

538
0:17:10,249 --> 0:17:13,189
they are just telling you a relatively safe and stable way of life

539
0:17:13,189 --> 0:17:14,88
a more stable way to live

540
0:17:14,88 --> 0:17:16,64
but they are out of touch with society

541
0:17:16,64 --> 0:17:19,31
because they are not the young people of today

542
0:17:19,31 --> 0:17:22,59
today's young people can't even find jobs

543
0:17:22,59 --> 0:17:25,88
so it all depends on how you play your cards

544
0:17:25,88 --> 0:17:27,9
there are things suitable for you to do now

545
0:17:27,9 --> 0:17:31,53
I suggest you try being an internet celebrity if possible

546
0:17:31,53 --> 0:17:32,3
give it a shot

547
0:17:32,3 --> 0:17:34,11
being a content creator is actually a good thing

548
0:17:34,11 --> 0:17:34,87
who knows

549
0:17:34,87 --> 0:17:35,83
maybe you'll make it

550
0:17:35,83 --> 0:17:37,11
there are many young people

551
0:17:37,11 --> 0:17:38,76
who have succeeded in running their own channels

552
0:17:38,76 --> 0:17:40,12
so no matter what

553
0:17:40,12 --> 0:17:43,14
life is about trying new things

554
0:17:43,14 --> 0:17:47,389
of course, within legal boundaries

555
0:17:47,389 --> 0:17:50,71
don't do anything you'll regret

556
0:17:53,99 --> 0:17:55,19
keep that in mind

557
0:17:55,19 --> 0:17:56,63
endless revenge leads nowhere

558
0:17:56,63 --> 0:17:58,11
life is a cycle

559
0:17:58,11 --> 0:18:0,31
what happens today may not catch up with you

560
0:18:0,31 --> 0:18:2,4
but it might come back tomorrow

561
0:18:2,4 --> 0:18:3,46
no matter what

562
0:18:3,46 --> 0:18:4,9
live well

563
0:18:4,9 --> 0:18:5,94
strive to live

564
0:18:5,94 --> 0:18:7,32
and one day

565
0:18:7,32 --> 0:18:11,25
when you truly face the end of your fate

566
0:18:11,25 --> 0:18:12,89
know why you live

567
0:18:12,89 --> 0:18:14,65
and why you die

568
0:18:14,65 --> 0:18:16,1
rather than

569
0:18:16,1 --> 0:18:17,37
let this life pass by

570
0:18:17,37 --> 0:18:18,73
don't overthink it

571
0:18:18,73 --> 0:18:20,13
this is a lifetime matter

572
0:18:20,13 --> 0:18:20,97
don't overthink it

573
0:18:20,97 --> 0:18:23,7
don't put too much pressure on yourself

574
0:18:23,7 --> 0:18:24,99
the pressure of the college entrance exam is already huge

575
0:18:24,99 --> 0:18:27,51
it's great that you can take the time to watch videos now

576
0:18:27,51 --> 0:18:29,51
or you're watching this video after the exam

577
0:18:29,51 --> 0:18:32,0
it's fine if you only stumbled upon this video now

578
0:18:32,0 --> 0:18:33,42
life is self-defined

579
0:18:33,42 --> 0:18:34,64
be happy
