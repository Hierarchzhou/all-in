1
0:0:0,96 --> 0:0:3,34
Human capacity has its limits.

2
0:0:3,34 --> 0:0:6,66
One's luck is constantly fluctuating.

3
0:0:6,66 --> 0:0:10,32
However, a person's desires are endless and always moving forward.

4
0:0:10,32 --> 0:0:10,78
Hello everyone.

5
0:0:10,78 --> 0:0:11,76
I'm Rong Zhen.

6
0:0:11,76 --> 0:0:13,8
Today, I'm showing my big face.

7
0:0:13,8 --> 0:0:15,36
Let's chat a bit.

8
0:0:15,36 --> 0:0:17,0
I went to pick up my motorcycle today.

9
0:0:17,0 --> 0:0:19,16
Actually, the motorcycle was registered a few days ago.

10
0:0:19,16 --> 0:0:20,74
But it's only mentioned today.

11
0:0:20,74 --> 0:0:22,78
It's just that Beijing has been quite hot these past couple of days.

12
0:0:22,78 --> 0:0:24,28
And it's been raining intermittently.

13
0:0:24,28 --> 0:0:28,4
People's desires tend to grow over time.

14
0:0:28,4 --> 0:0:30,3
However, human capacity is limited.

15
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:34,9
Desires increase exponentially.

16
0:0:34,9 --> 0:0:36,37
I just got my car.

17
0:0:36,37 --> 0:0:37,65
I posted a few updates on my social media.

18
0:0:37,65 --> 0:0:43,8
Someone asked, 'Rong, are you driving a sport bike or a street bike?'

19
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:45,6
Are you riding an ADV?

20
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:49,0
Bro Rong, someone like you should at least get a 450cc or above.

21
0:0:49,0 --> 0:0:49,58
Bro Rong,

22
0:0:49,58 --> 0:0:50,5
with your financial means,

23
0:0:50,5 --> 0:0:52,28
you could easily afford an ABV.

24
0:0:52,28 --> 0:0:54,52
Why did you only get a 125cc scooter?

25
0:0:54,52 --> 0:0:58,47
Ah, a lot of people started encouraging me to get something better,

26
0:0:58,47 --> 0:0:59,73
a larger displacement,

27
0:0:59,73 --> 0:1:0,65
a more powerful one.

28
0:1:0,65 --> 0:1:2,19
a more expensive car

29
0:1:2,19 --> 0:1:4,39
then I started to think

30
0:1:4,39 --> 0:1:8,94
should I buy a better, more powerful, and more expensive car?

31
0:1:8,94 --> 0:1:11,74
the other day I complained about the operations team giving me bad advice

32
0:1:11,74 --> 0:1:14,56
which led to a decrease in my Power Up transactions

33
0:1:14,56 --> 0:1:19,94
but the most important reason isn't about what the operations team said

34
0:1:19,94 --> 0:1:22,39
or whether what they said was right or wrong

35
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:27,2
it's that my heart has always been troubled by envy

36
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:31,12
as I often say, comparison is the thief of joy

37
0:1:31,12 --> 0:1:34,64
It's something that really takes away your joy.

38
0:1:34,64 --> 0:1:38,98
A lot of the time, we say I have over 600,000 followers, almost 700,000.

39
0:1:38,98 --> 0:1:41,76
It's actually something to be really happy about.

40
0:1:41,76 --> 0:1:44,79
Because what I do is voice-overs.

41
0:1:44,79 --> 0:1:45,299
When it comes to voice-overs,

42
0:1:45,299 --> 0:1:47,399
many people don't do it very well.

43
0:1:47,399 --> 0:1:50,419
Of course, there are now many people with over a million followers for voice-overs.

44
0:1:50,419 --> 0:1:50,999
They are better than me.

45
0:1:50,999 --> 0:1:54,74
But let's face it, everyone's time to shine is different.

46
0:1:54,74 --> 0:1:56,38
Why are you in such a rush?

47
0:1:59,26 --> 0:2:1,69
Various aspects within the industry

48
0:2:1,69 --> 0:2:3,57
During these guild gatherings

49
0:2:3,57 --> 0:2:5,89
You'll see many outstanding players

50
0:2:5,89 --> 0:2:8,22
Under the spotlight, they receive awards

51
0:2:8,22 --> 0:2:9,62
Their data is excellent

52
0:2:9,62 --> 0:2:12,22
Their performance keeps climbing

53
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:13,66
You start to get anxious

54
0:2:13,66 --> 0:2:15,26
Oh, and you start to feel envious

55
0:2:15,26 --> 0:2:16,8
I often say

56
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:18,94
that my mom only taught me to admire others

57
0:2:18,94 --> 0:2:20,6
but not to envy them

58
0:2:20,6 --> 0:2:21,38
but in reality

59
0:2:21,38 --> 0:2:24,5
both my grandmother and my maternal grandmother were strong women

60
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:26,61
who really enjoyed comparing themselves to others

61
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:28,59
and feeling bad when they came up short

62
0:2:28,59 --> 0:2:31,75
and throughout their lives

63
0:2:31,75 --> 0:2:33,45
they constantly pushed their children to compete

64
0:2:33,45 --> 0:2:36,78
I want my child to be just as competitive as they are.

65
0:2:36,78 --> 0:2:39,14
But in reality, the kids tend to be more laid-back.

66
0:2:39,14 --> 0:2:41,66
My parents were the type who didn’t seek conflict with others.

67
0:2:41,66 --> 0:2:43,649
Of course, they were still quite ambitious.

68
0:2:43,649 --> 0:2:45,169
But this competitive mindset,

69
0:2:45,169 --> 0:2:47,649
to be honest, is a reflection of our country’s culture,

70
0:2:47,649 --> 0:2:50,53
which emphasizes excellence and success.

71
0:2:50,53 --> 0:2:51,57
There's a drive to be the best.

72
0:2:51,57 --> 0:2:52,25
To be at the forefront.

73
0:2:52,25 --> 0:2:54,37
But actually, this thing is meaningless.

74
0:2:54,37 --> 0:2:55,5
You know?

75
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:56,77
It’s about being the first to compete.

76
0:2:56,77 --> 0:2:58,55
In the end, the platform wins.

77
0:2:58,55 --> 0:3:0,8
Of course, that’s true.

78
0:3:0,8 --> 0:3:0,72
They manipulate you.

79
0:3:0,72 --> 0:3:2,12
And you generate better results.

80
0:3:2,12 --> 0:3:3,96
Naturally, everyone is part of the same interest group.

81
0:3:3,96 --> 0:3:5,12
But no matter what,

82
0:3:5,12 --> 0:3:6,28
You need to understand

83
0:3:6,28 --> 0:3:8,95
human desires are endless.

84
0:3:8,95 --> 0:3:12,57
You can't pursue infinite desires with a finite life.

85
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:13,55
At a certain point,

86
0:3:13,55 --> 0:3:15,1
you have to realize

87
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:17,69
the importance of steady and stable development.

88
0:3:17,69 --> 0:3:18,73
To put it simply,

89
0:3:18,73 --> 0:3:20,18
it's like riding a motorcycle.

90
0:3:20,18 --> 0:3:22,18
Actually, you can see Brother Rong driving a 125cc one.

91
0:3:22,18 --> 0:3:23,38
Inside Beijing City

92
0:3:23,38 --> 0:3:25,22
I already feel it's incredibly fast

93
0:3:25,22 --> 0:3:27,42
I used to ride an electric scooter for 40 minutes

94
0:3:27,42 --> 0:3:29,48
now it takes only 19 minutes by car

95
0:3:29,48 --> 0:3:31,12
I start from the western fourth ring of Beijing

96
0:3:31,12 --> 0:3:33,4
and head straight to the northwest second ring

97
0:3:33,4 --> 0:3:34,96
Of course, I have temporary plates these past two days

98
0:3:34,96 --> 0:3:36,74
so I don't have to worry about the restricted areas

99
0:3:36,74 --> 0:3:38,82
In a couple of days, I'll park at the northern fourth ring

100
0:3:38,82 --> 0:3:39,42
Uh

101
0:3:39,42 --> 0:3:43,0
These past couple of days are my last chance to enjoy eating in Beijing

102
0:3:43,0 --> 0:3:45,75
During these days of riding the motorcycle

103
0:3:45,75 --> 0:3:46,99
Because of buying gold coins

104
0:3:46,99 --> 0:3:49,97
Gold coins are still relatively scarce

105
0:3:49,97 --> 0:3:50,45
Gold coins are good

106
0:3:50,45 --> 0:3:51,21
For getting a Beijing A plate

107
0:3:51,21 --> 0:3:52,17
It’s now 300,000

108
0:3:52,17 --> 0:3:53,1
It used to be 400,000

109
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:53,77
It's now at 300,000.

110
0:3:53,77 --> 0:3:56,48
So, if you can't get a license plate in Beijing,

111
0:3:56,48 --> 0:3:58,46
and you have a motorcycle license,

112
0:3:58,46 --> 0:4:2,86
consider getting a Beijing A plate as soon as possible.

113
0:4:3,89 --> 0:4:5,63
Especially in the six central districts.

114
0:4:5,63 --> 0:4:9,73
So, once you get a car,

115
0:4:9,73 --> 0:4:11,57
you start thinking about a better one.

116
0:4:11,57 --> 0:4:13,23
When you have a few hundred thousand followers,

117
0:4:13,23 --> 0:4:15,33
you start aiming for a million followers.

118
0:4:15,33 --> 0:4:16,85
You just want to be part of the BILIBILI UP100

119
0:4:16,85 --> 0:4:18,74
You just want to get the golden badge

120
0:4:18,74 --> 0:4:21,74
Many people are talking about the current economic situation

121
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:24,11
They are extremely pessimistic about it

122
0:4:24,11 --> 0:4:27,85
I say, actually, all of you are talking about the economic downturn

123
0:4:27,85 --> 0:4:30,29
Everyone is saying the economy is in bad shape now

124
0:4:30,29 --> 0:4:31,74
Who are you comparing yourself to

125
0:4:31,74 --> 0:4:34,94
First, you are comparing yourself to developed countries

126
0:4:34,94 --> 0:4:36,88
Are developed countries doing well themselves

127
0:4:36,88 --> 0:4:38,68
Developed countries are struggling too these days.

128
0:4:38,68 --> 0:4:39,37
Isn't that right?

129
0:4:39,37 --> 0:4:40,73
Housing prices are dropping everywhere.

130
0:4:40,73 --> 0:4:42,51
Even in Vancouver, the housing prices have dropped.

131
0:4:42,51 --> 0:4:46,14
Vancouver, a place where global tycoons have been speculating in property.

132
0:4:46,14 --> 0:4:47,44
Its housing prices have fallen as well.

133
0:4:47,44 --> 0:4:50,1
Doesn't that indicate there's a problem with the global economy?

134
0:4:50,1 --> 0:4:52,65
And you keep bringing up the economic downturn.

135
0:4:52,65 --> 0:4:55,55
Compared to the years of economic growth in recent years.

136
0:4:55,55 --> 0:4:56,75
That's just not right.

137
0:4:56,75 --> 0:4:59,39
You should compare it with the years when the economy was more stable.

138
0:4:59,39 --> 0:5:1,17
Why don't you compare it with the year 776?

139
0:5:1,17 --> 0:5:2,89
Why don't you compare it with the year 75?

140
0:5:2,89 --> 0:5:5,3
Why can't you compare it with the years 83 and 84?

141
0:5:5,3 --> 0:5:7,15
The economy is definitely in better shape now than back then.

142
0:5:7,15 --> 0:5:7,57
Right?

143
0:5:7,57 --> 0:5:8,87
And there's more material abundance.

144
0:5:8,87 --> 0:5:11,11
You always compare it with the years when the economy was booming.

145
0:5:11,11 --> 0:5:12,41
It's like you're saying

146
0:5:12,41 --> 0:5:14,55
Brother Rong is now forty-one or forty-two

147
0:5:14,55 --> 0:5:16,89
I don't have the same stamina as when I was 24

148
0:5:16,89 --> 0:5:18,51
Isn't that obvious?

149
0:5:18,51 --> 0:5:20,51
You can't expect to have better stamina than when you were 24

150
0:5:20,51 --> 0:5:22,13
What did you eat, buddy?

151
0:5:22,13 --> 0:5:22,71
Buddy

152
0:5:22,71 --> 0:5:23,23
What did you eat?

153
0:5:23,23 --> 0:5:25,11
Tell me, what did you actually eat?'

154
0:5:25,11 --> 0:5:26,95
Wow, it’s become so powerful all of a sudden

155
0:5:26,95 --> 0:5:27,67
That’s intense

156
0:5:27,67 --> 0:5:29,3
This goes against the laws of nature

157
0:5:29,3 --> 0:5:29,47
Do you know that

158
0:5:29,47 --> 0:5:33,15
You can’t keep comparing economic downturns with upturns

159
0:5:33,15 --> 0:5:34,4
Which years are you talking about

160
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:36,2
The economy was on the rise

161
0:5:36,2 --> 0:5:37,6
Because of the large-scale infrastructure projects back then

162
0:5:37,6 --> 0:5:40,72
All those infrastructure projects hadn’t been completed yet

163
0:5:40,72 --> 0:5:43,49
Of course he has his perks.

164
0:5:43,49 --> 0:5:45,89
If you want to boost the economy again now,

165
0:5:45,89 --> 0:5:46,37
it's simple.

166
0:5:46,37 --> 0:5:49,62
You tear down all the railways and skyscrapers across the country,

167
0:5:49,62 --> 0:5:51,4
and rebuild them.

168
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:52,12
The economy will definitely rise again.

169
0:5:52,12 --> 0:5:53,34
No problem.

170
0:5:53,34 --> 0:5:53,96
It will rise again.

171
0:5:53,96 --> 0:5:54,789
Still going up

172
0:5:54,789 --> 0:5:57,469
The question is whether you can live an ordinary life

173
0:5:57,469 --> 0:5:59,429
Whether you can live a normal life

174
0:5:59,429 --> 0:6:3,3
To enjoy a normal life in a moderately developed country

175
0:6:3,3 --> 0:6:4,85
Are you going hungry now?

176
0:6:4,85 --> 0:6:6,47
Or are you lacking necessities?

177
0:6:6,47 --> 0:6:8,9
Are you struggling to make ends meet?

178
0:6:8,9 --> 0:6:9,41
Are you, now?

179
0:6:9,41 --> 0:6:11,7
If you expect us not to buy a house

180
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:11,83
What are we supposed to do?

181
0:6:11,83 --> 0:6:13,68
Did you end up living under a bridge?

182
0:6:13,68 --> 0:6:15,12
Oh, are you living under a bridge?

183
0:6:15,12 --> 0:6:16,64
You're currently staying in a public rental housing, right?

184
0:6:16,64 --> 0:6:17,44
Living under a bridge?

185
0:6:17,44 --> 0:6:18,96
Are you staying in that abandoned building?

186
0:6:18,96 --> 0:6:20,7
I don't think so.

187
0:6:20,7 --> 0:6:21,57
So what are you complaining about?

188
0:6:21,57 --> 0:6:22,55
What are you barking about?

189
0:6:22,55 --> 0:6:23,39
I don't get it.

190
0:6:23,39 --> 0:6:27,35
Are your current conditions really better than they were back then?

191
0:6:27,35 --> 0:6:30,31
Thinking back, it's been 20 years now.

192
0:6:30,31 --> 0:6:31,23
Even 15 years ago, wow.

193
0:6:31,23 --> 0:6:32,75
The economy was really good back then.

194
0:6:32,75 --> 0:6:34,37
Is that what you thought back then?

195
0:6:34,37 --> 0:6:36,11
You weren't thinking about things like Sudan Red,

196
0:6:36,11 --> 0:6:38,8
Peacock Green, or the various Sanlu milk powder issues.

197
0:6:38,8 --> 0:6:40,0
Weren't those the things on your mind?

198
0:6:40,0 --> 0:6:41,16
Weren't you thinking about people dying here?

199
0:6:41,16 --> 0:6:41,68
There are fatalities there.

200
0:6:41,68 --> 0:6:42,98
Is the disaster happening here, here?

201
0:6:42,98 --> 0:6:43,86
Is this what you were thinking?

202
0:6:43,86 --> 0:6:46,26
Back then, you also thought about doing your best, right?

203
0:6:46,26 --> 0:6:46,9
Hurry up and run.

204
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:47,78
Right?

205
0:6:47,78 --> 0:6:49,2
Everything is fake.

206
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:50,14
Nothing is real.

207
0:6:50,14 --> 0:6:51,42
Nothing is appropriate.

208
0:6:51,42 --> 0:6:52,75
There were issues everywhere.

209
0:6:52,75 --> 0:6:54,75
You were also full of complaints back then.

210
0:6:54,75 --> 0:6:57,23
You talked to you about all these economic matters.

211
0:6:57,23 --> 0:7:0,4
To put it bluntly, it's just a BS thing.

212
0:7:0,4 --> 0:7:1,26
It's just make-believe.

213
0:7:1,26 --> 0:7:1,82
Do you know?

214
0:7:1,82 --> 0:7:4,12
If you can boost confidence,

215
0:7:4,12 --> 0:7:5,66
Everyone will have confidence,

216
0:7:5,66 --> 0:7:7,3
Everyone will think it can work out.

217
0:7:7,3 --> 0:7:8,85
This can be done.

218
0:7:8,85 --> 0:7:10,33
Everyone has lost confidence.

219
0:7:10,33 --> 0:7:11,55
When you encounter an issue,

220
0:7:11,55 --> 0:7:14,53
a security incident in a distant place might also turn bad.

221
0:7:14,53 --> 0:7:15,53
You feel like it’s not going to work out.

222
0:7:15,53 --> 0:7:16,85
It’s not working anywhere in the country.

223
0:7:16,85 --> 0:7:18,69
When will things start to improve?

224
0:7:18,69 --> 0:7:19,38
Buddy,

225
0:7:19,38 --> 0:7:21,7
an incident in a remote area

226
0:7:21,7 --> 0:7:22,66
It's definitely very unfair.

227
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:23,94
Just like the official explanation shows.

228
0:7:23,94 --> 0:7:25,74
It explains what's going on with him.

229
0:7:25,74 --> 0:7:27,81
Now, the official statement clarifies everything.

230
0:7:27,81 --> 0:7:30,93
Why have you suddenly lost faith in everyone across the country?

231
0:7:30,93 --> 0:7:33,32
Your confidence is pretty fragile, isn't it?

232
0:7:33,32 --> 0:7:35,36
Just because of a village entrance blockage incident.

233
0:7:35,36 --> 0:7:36,76
Then you read the signs and make broad inferences.

234
0:7:36,76 --> 0:7:38,26
So, it's clear.

235
0:7:38,26 --> 0:7:39,68
It definitely won't work in the future

236
0:7:39,68 --> 0:7:43,18
I just don't understand where some people get their thinking from

237
0:7:43,18 --> 0:7:44,68
I ride a 125cc motorcycle

238
0:7:44,68 --> 0:7:46,23
I wish I had a 450cc motorcycle

239
0:7:46,23 --> 0:7:47,91
And when the economy is in a downturn

240
0:7:47,91 --> 0:7:49,57
I think about how great it would be if it were booming

241
0:7:49,57 --> 0:7:50,91
One peak and one trough

242
0:7:50,91 --> 0:7:52,27
There's bound to be a huge difference

243
0:7:52,27 --> 0:7:52,71
Right?

244
0:7:52,71 --> 0:7:54,86
The entire Y-axis is right there.

245
0:7:54,86 --> 0:7:57,45
You should compare it with the usual, okay?

246
0:7:57,45 --> 0:7:59,49
You always go into stocks.

247
0:7:59,49 --> 0:8:1,73
And you always compare yourself to those who have made a fortune.

248
0:8:1,73 --> 0:8:2,57
Who got rich overnight.

249
0:8:2,57 --> 0:8:3,81
Can you really be at peace with that?

250
0:8:3,81 --> 0:8:4,44
My buddy,

251
0:8:4,44 --> 0:8:6,88
First, you should compare yourself to the average.

252
0:8:6,88 --> 0:8:7,6
You need to understand this.

253
0:8:7,6 --> 0:8:8,68
There's always an up and a down.

254
0:8:8,68 --> 0:8:10,32
There are definitely people making money.

255
0:8:10,32 --> 0:8:11,56
Right?

256
0:8:12,4 --> 0:8:14,26
You should really consider changing your industry.

257
0:8:14,26 --> 0:8:16,12
You should think about which industries are thriving now.

258
0:8:16,12 --> 0:8:16,86
Absolutely.

259
0:8:16,86 --> 0:8:18,78
This is a fairly realistic situation.

260
0:8:18,78 --> 0:8:20,32
Instead of trying to make it seem better.

261
0:8:20,32 --> 0:8:21,48
Always complaining

262
0:8:21,48 --> 0:8:22,74
I'm always thinking about this thing

263
0:8:22,74 --> 0:8:24,49
What should I do?

264
0:8:24,49 --> 0:8:25,769
And if this thing doesn't go well

265
0:8:25,769 --> 0:8:27,369
it's the macro environment that's the issue

266
0:8:27,369 --> 0:8:28,949
a downturn in the economy

267
0:8:28,949 --> 0:8:31,79
Now many people are paying the price for their own foolishness

268
0:8:31,79 --> 0:8:34,83
and they start blaming the economic downturn

269
0:8:34,83 --> 0:8:39,5
But the macroeconomic environment has little to do with your personal gains and losses

270
0:8:39,5 --> 0:8:40,78
really, it doesn't have much of an impact

271
0:8:40,78 --> 0:8:43,14
You're not in the service industry.

272
0:8:43,14 --> 0:8:45,2
What is the service industry?

273
0:8:45,2 --> 0:8:48,16
What kind of work do you do?

274
0:8:48,16 --> 0:8:49,12
I know what you do.

275
0:8:49,12 --> 0:8:50,46
You interact with customers every day.

276
0:8:50,46 --> 0:8:52,28
You see three or five customers a day.

277
0:8:52,28 --> 0:8:53,52
When the economy takes a hit,

278
0:8:53,52 --> 0:8:55,15
people spend less money on you.

279
0:8:55,15 --> 0:8:59,36
That's why you might complain about the tough times.

280
0:8:59,36 --> 0:9:1,64
Actually, most people just stick to their own industry.

281
0:9:1,64 --> 0:9:2,8
But if your industry takes a downturn,

282
0:9:2,8 --> 0:9:3,76
you can definitely feel it.

283
0:9:3,76 --> 0:9:4,88
However, for many people,

284
0:9:4,88 --> 0:9:7,27
the connection between the overall economic environment and their industry is unclear.

285
0:9:7,27 --> 0:9:9,41
It doesn’t seem to have much of a connection at all.

286
0:9:9,41 --> 0:9:10,95
Then they start to panic at the slightest hint of trouble.

287
0:9:10,95 --> 0:9:12,61
And they end up parroting what everyone else is saying.

288
0:9:12,61 --> 0:9:15,5
Look, before all these official announcements come out,

289
0:9:15,5 --> 0:9:15,97
Everyone's talking about it

290
0:9:15,97 --> 0:9:17,51
speculating all sorts of things

291
0:9:17,51 --> 0:9:19,63
So when there's no clear conclusion

292
0:9:19,63 --> 0:9:21,23
and nothing can convince everyone

293
0:9:21,23 --> 0:9:22,64
rumors become the most effective

294
0:9:22,64 --> 0:9:24,52
So if your rumor

295
0:9:24,52 --> 0:9:26,92
Why do many people insist on doing IQ tests?

296
0:9:26,92 --> 0:9:29,99
Because in the past, the internet was used by elites

297
0:9:29,99 --> 0:9:31,59
highly educated individuals

298
0:9:31,59 --> 0:9:32,77
In '97 and '98

299
0:9:32,77 --> 0:9:34,37
In '99 and those years, it was like that

300
0:9:34,37 --> 0:9:36,81
Later on, it gradually became accessible to ordinary people

301
0:9:36,81 --> 0:9:37,59
You had a computer

302
0:9:37,59 --> 0:9:38,49
As long as you could afford the internet fees

303
0:9:38,49 --> 0:9:39,1
You could get online

304
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:40,5
Nowadays

305
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:41,71
You can get online with just a smartphone

306
0:9:41,71 --> 0:9:43,43
Whether it's a Redmi or a budget phone

307
0:9:43,43 --> 0:9:44,31
A machine costing five or six hundred yuan

308
0:9:44,31 --> 0:9:44,95
allows you to go online

309
0:9:44,95 --> 0:9:45,47
allows you to express yourself

310
0:9:45,47 --> 0:9:47,73
allows you to cheer for your fandom

311
0:9:47,73 --> 0:9:49,31
Many things are like this

312
0:9:49,31 --> 0:9:51,47
That's why there are more and more internet fools nowadays

313
0:9:51,47 --> 0:9:53,93
So, whether it's ordinary people or the intelligentsia

314
0:9:53,93 --> 0:9:56,3
the intelligentsia are relatively easier to pacify

315
0:9:56,3 --> 0:9:56,87
They understand reason

316
0:9:56,87 --> 0:9:57,95
Just enforce the law clearly.

317
0:9:57,95 --> 0:10:0,2
You're just a typical fool.

318
0:10:0,2 --> 0:10:2,66
No matter how you talk to him, it won't work.

319
0:10:2,66 --> 0:10:5,56
So, most people lack confidence.

320
0:10:5,56 --> 0:10:7,56
And most people are foolish.

321
0:10:7,56 --> 0:10:9,0
You need to understand this.

322
0:10:9,0 --> 0:10:12,92
Today, in China, those who have received higher education,

323
0:10:12,92 --> 0:10:15,68
only make up 6.5% of the entire population.

324
0:10:18,12 --> 0:10:19,72
You know, I have a college degree.

325
0:10:19,72 --> 0:10:20,24
I'm a third-year student.

326
0:10:20,24 --> 0:10:21,92
So you're also in that 6.5%

327
0:10:21,92 --> 0:10:24,77
Most people don't have a basic understanding of science.

328
0:10:24,77 --> 0:10:26,37
They don't understand statistics at all.

329
0:10:26,37 --> 0:10:26,85
or probability.

330
0:10:26,85 --> 0:10:27,29
or psychology.

331
0:10:27,29 --> 0:10:28,1
or social psychology.

332
0:10:28,1 --> 0:10:29,61
They don't even know what social psychology is.

333
0:10:29,61 --> 0:10:32,659
When an infectious disease occurs, one bad event in one place can spread.

334
0:10:32,659 --> 0:10:33,859
Other places will follow suit

335
0:10:33,859 --> 0:10:34,69
That's how it is

336
0:10:34,69 --> 0:10:37,23
So after the first person at a university chose to jump

337
0:10:37,23 --> 0:10:40,339
Eventually, countless people at universities opted to jump

338
0:10:40,339 --> 0:10:40,999
It's a bit of a barrier

339
0:10:40,999 --> 0:10:42,499
A bit of pressure is just too much to bear

340
0:10:42,499 --> 0:10:44,37
And they insist on taking their own lives in this manner

341
0:10:44,37 --> 0:10:46,1
This is a phenomenon in social psychology

342
0:10:46,1 --> 0:10:47,1
It's also related to epidemiology

343
0:10:47,1 --> 0:10:49,13
What do humanities disciplines do?

344
0:10:49,13 --> 0:10:50,17
It's not just for leisure.

345
0:10:50,17 --> 0:10:51,85
It's not about causing trouble for others.

346
0:10:51,85 --> 0:10:55,72
Studying humanities is about addressing the contradictions in human development.

347
0:10:55,72 --> 0:10:56,98
That's what humanities are all about.

348
0:10:56,98 --> 0:10:59,62
The comprehensive significance of liberal arts lies in this.

349
0:10:59,62 --> 0:11:1,36
To resolve the contradictions in social development.

350
0:11:1,36 --> 0:11:3,53
This is crucial.

351
0:11:4,21 --> 0:11:6,23
So, we're back to the motorcycle issue.

352
0:11:6,23 --> 0:11:8,33
I bought the motorcycle for the joy it brings.

353
0:11:8,33 --> 0:11:9,97
Whose displacement am I comparing it to?

354
0:11:9,97 --> 0:11:11,97
People with high displacement bikes still die, you know.

355
0:11:11,97 --> 0:11:12,48
Right?

356
0:11:12,48 --> 0:11:15,28
Is true happiness in economic development really a good thing?

357
0:11:15,28 --> 0:11:16,88
When the economy grows rapidly,

358
0:11:16,88 --> 0:11:18,22
you haven’t even gotten on board yet.

359
0:11:18,22 --> 0:11:21,6
Do you think rapid economic growth will benefit you?

360
0:11:21,6 --> 0:11:24,14
It will only widen the wealth gap between you and others.

361
0:11:24,14 --> 0:11:24,98
Right?

362
0:11:24,98 --> 0:11:26,5
Then I have this many followers,

363
0:11:26,5 --> 0:11:26,9
At this point,

364
0:11:26,9 --> 0:11:29,58
Why didn’t I compare myself to those who have been banned for years?

365
0:11:29,58 --> 0:11:30,22
Why not?

366
0:11:30,22 --> 0:11:32,66
Why didn’t I compare myself to those with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of followers,

367
0:11:32,66 --> 0:11:34,35
Who have been doing this for years?

368
0:11:34,35 --> 0:11:36,97
Why do I have to compare myself to the people ahead of me?

369
0:11:36,97 --> 0:11:39,39
I’m actually luckier than the people ahead of me.

370
0:11:39,39 --> 0:11:41,3
Or maybe I'm just more capable

371
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:42,98
But the number of followers does reveal something

372
0:11:42,98 --> 0:11:44,9
But does that mean I'm not putting in effort

373
0:11:44,9 --> 0:11:46,3
Does that mean I'm not good enough

374
0:11:46,3 --> 0:11:48,54
Does that mean I'm absolutely worthless

375
0:11:48,54 --> 0:11:49,6
Not necessarily

376
0:11:49,6 --> 0:11:54,43
Why do you use others as a benchmark for yourself

377
0:11:54,43 --> 0:11:56,15
Why surpass the United States

378
0:11:56,15 --> 0:11:58,55
Is the primary goal of our country's development

379
0:11:58,55 --> 0:11:59,839
We just have to surpass it

380
0:11:59,839 --> 0:12:1,59
We just have to be stronger than him

381
0:12:1,59 --> 0:12:2,719
We just have to be the global hegemon

382
0:12:2,719 --> 0:12:3,279
The military hegemon

383
0:12:3,279 --> 0:12:4,199
In terms of military

384
0:12:4,199 --> 0:12:4,679
In terms of technology

385
0:12:4,679 --> 0:12:6,379
In terms of culture, we have to surpass him in everything

386
0:12:6,379 --> 0:12:8,5
Aren’t you tired?

387
0:12:8,5 --> 0:12:11,5
Is everyone prepared for the long-term role of being second?'

388
0:12:11,5 --> 0:12:13,73
Do we need to spend a long time preparing for development?

389
0:12:13,73 --> 0:12:15,48
Even if we surpass him later,

390
0:12:15,48 --> 0:12:17,92
Should we also keep a low profile and make a fortune?

391
0:12:17,92 --> 0:12:18,72
Many issues are like this,

392
0:12:18,72 --> 0:12:21,52
Why do I have to reach one million followers?

393
0:12:21,52 --> 0:12:24,92
Why do I have to buy a car with a 450cc engine?

394
0:12:24,92 --> 0:12:26,12
If I buy a car with a 450cc engine,

395
0:12:26,12 --> 0:12:27,4
Will I have poor driving skills?

396
0:12:27,4 --> 0:12:28,17
Will I get into a fatal accident?

397
0:12:28,17 --> 0:12:31,33
I got first place in this Mario race.

398
0:12:31,33 --> 0:12:33,41
But getting hit by a nuclear bomb as the winner isn’t exactly a good thing, is it?

399
0:12:33,41 --> 0:12:35,9
If we were to outperform the U.S. in every statistic,

400
0:12:35,9 --> 0:12:38,74
wouldn’t the whole world start targeting us, making us the second?

401
0:12:38,74 --> 0:12:40,1
Actually, there’s nothing wrong with that.

402
0:12:40,1 --> 0:12:41,82
Being the nominal second,

403
0:12:41,82 --> 0:12:43,81
while actually being the first, isn’t that perfect?

404
0:12:43,81 --> 0:12:47,41
So once my follower count grows to a certain number,

405
0:12:47,41 --> 0:12:48,69
like reaching one million.

406
0:12:48,69 --> 0:12:51,25
Troubles started as I came along and spoke a lot.

407
0:12:51,25 --> 0:12:52,74
I became even more hesitant to speak up.

408
0:12:52,74 --> 0:12:53,58
I won an award.

409
0:12:53,58 --> 0:12:54,34
After winning the BILIBILI UP100,

410
0:12:54,34 --> 0:12:56,76
the possibility of me being banned would skyrocket.

411
0:12:56,76 --> 0:12:58,9
Because your words carry more weight now.

412
0:12:58,9 --> 0:12:59,88
Did you ever think about it?

413
0:12:59,88 --> 0:13:2,14
Actually, this figure is around seven or eight hundred thousand.

414
0:13:2,14 --> 0:13:4,62
This is the most wonderful time right now.

415
0:13:4,62 --> 0:13:5,66
You've hit one million

416
0:13:5,66 --> 0:13:6,14
two million

417
0:13:6,14 --> 0:13:9,17
you'll have meetings that never seem to end

418
0:13:9,17 --> 0:13:10,95
you have a 150cc

419
0:13:10,95 --> 0:13:11,69
200cc

420
0:13:11,69 --> 0:13:12,41
400cc

421
0:13:12,41 --> 0:13:13,73
when you become a motorcyclist

422
0:13:13,73 --> 0:13:15,87
you're not far from the end of your life

423
0:13:15,87 --> 0:13:17,93
your economy is on the rise every day

424
0:13:17,93 --> 0:13:18,75
What should we do?

425
0:13:18,75 --> 0:13:19,91
The economy was booming back then.

426
0:13:19,91 --> 0:13:21,3
Look at World War II.

427
0:13:21,3 --> 0:13:23,11
Germany and Japan were experiencing economic growth every day.

428
0:13:23,11 --> 0:13:24,69
The economy was doing great.

429
0:13:24,69 --> 0:13:27,49
You were the locomotive of the economy.

430
0:13:27,49 --> 0:13:28,37
What about those people?

431
0:13:28,37 --> 0:13:29,69
Right?

432
0:13:29,69 --> 0:13:31,149
Do you feel like you're earning ten dollars?

433
0:13:31,149 --> 0:13:32,909
So the rich made 1.1 million

434
0:13:32,909 --> 0:13:34,109
It’s better that no one does well

435
0:13:34,109 --> 0:13:36,82
It’s better if everyone is at an average level

436
0:13:36,82 --> 0:13:38,38
Nowadays, people find it hard to make money

437
0:13:40,56 --> 0:13:42,2
So don’t always think about it

438
0:13:42,2 --> 0:13:43,56
The past was really great

439
0:13:43,56 --> 0:13:44,48
The past was really great

440
0:13:44,48 --> 0:13:46,68
Back in the 90s, people were already saying the past was better

441
0:13:46,68 --> 0:13:48,74
By 2000, people were saying the 90s were better

442
0:13:48,74 --> 0:13:51,3
Back in 2001, people were saying things were better in the year 2000.

443
0:13:51,3 --> 0:13:52,38
Now it's 2025,

444
0:13:52,38 --> 0:13:54,2
and some are saying things were better a decade ago.

445
0:13:54,2 --> 0:13:55,829
But you didn't think so at the time, did you?

446
0:13:55,829 --> 0:13:56,729
Let me repeat that.

447
0:13:56,729 --> 0:13:57,349
Sudan Red,

448
0:13:57,349 --> 0:13:57,929
Peacock Green,

449
0:13:57,929 --> 0:13:58,589
all sorts of colors,

450
0:13:58,589 --> 0:13:59,569
My dad is Li Gang.

451
0:13:59,569 --> 0:14:0,709
Was it good back then?

452
0:14:0,709 --> 0:14:2,909
You barely had time to worry about his affairs back then.

453
0:14:2,909 --> 0:14:4,29
All sorts of things.

454
0:14:4,29 --> 0:14:6,44
Wasn't the military equipment not as strong back then?

455
0:14:6,44 --> 0:14:9,66
This is the best era we have.

456
0:14:9,66 --> 0:14:12,46
The car priced at 125,000 has 800,000 views online.

457
0:14:12,46 --> 0:14:13,5
With over 600,000 followers,

458
0:14:13,5 --> 0:14:14,46
670,000 followers,

459
0:14:14,46 --> 0:14:18,12
Brother Rong with 678,000 followers is the most candid now.

460
0:14:18,12 --> 0:14:19,16
When we hit a million,

461
0:14:19,16 --> 0:14:20,58
I'll be talking nonsense.

462
0:14:20,58 --> 0:14:21,4
But don't worry,

463
0:14:21,4 --> 0:14:22,51
it'll all be good nonsense.

464
0:14:22,51 --> 0:14:24,95
So at this point, it's crucial to understand the principle of moderation.

465
0:14:24,95 --> 0:14:26,43
What exactly is moderation?

466
0:14:27,67 --> 0:14:28,85
It's important to understand,

467
0:14:28,85 --> 0:14:32,0
you must never be all show and no substance.

468
0:14:32,0 --> 0:14:32,5
Right?

469
0:14:32,5 --> 0:14:33,86
The way of moderation is crucial.

470
0:14:33,86 --> 0:14:36,779
It means that extremes lead to their opposites.

471
0:14:36,779 --> 0:14:38,639
So many things develop positively,

472
0:14:38,639 --> 0:14:39,899
becoming the best in the world,

473
0:14:39,899 --> 0:14:41,139
performance improves,

474
0:14:41,139 --> 0:14:42,37
follower count increases,

475
0:14:42,37 --> 0:14:44,1
but it might also mean that few can appreciate it.

476
0:14:44,1 --> 0:14:46,4
or it might be lonely at the top.

477
0:14:46,4 --> 0:14:47,16
or it might not be as good as it seems.

478
0:14:47,16 --> 0:14:49,0
Now I feel even happier

479
0:14:49,0 --> 0:14:50,56
Sometimes you might find yourself unable to resist

480
0:14:50,56 --> 0:14:52,12
That's just how things are in this world

481
0:14:52,12 --> 0:14:53,95
This is the objective law of how things evolve

482
0:14:53,95 --> 0:14:58,73
So the premise of comparing yourself to others is that you believe they surpass you

483
0:14:58,73 --> 0:15:0,17
Others are stronger than you

484
0:15:0,17 --> 0:15:1,31
They are happy

485
0:15:1,31 --> 0:15:3,329
But the question is, are they really happy?

486
0:15:3,329 --> 0:15:6,9
Isn't it true that someone's account with millions can be discarded at will?

487
0:15:6,9 --> 0:15:7,47
Just say you won't do it and that's it?

488
0:15:7,47 --> 0:15:9,59
An account with millions of followers

489
0:15:9,59 --> 0:15:11,47
He must have four sons at once

490
0:15:11,47 --> 0:15:12,61
Then what happens

491
0:15:12,61 --> 0:15:14,1
Would he be over the moon?

492
0:15:14,1 --> 0:15:15,23
Is it really that extreme?

493
0:15:15,23 --> 0:15:15,75
Of course, to be fair

494
0:15:15,75 --> 0:15:18,1
Brother Rong isn't saying she must have children

495
0:15:18,1 --> 0:15:19,43
It's about having a bunch of sons

496
0:15:19,43 --> 0:15:20,15
I feel the same way.

497
0:15:20,15 --> 0:15:23,12
Having a baby is an incredibly tough experience.

498
0:15:23,12 --> 0:15:25,2
To put it plainly, in many cases,

499
0:15:25,2 --> 0:15:26,78
it might not make you feel all that great.

500
0:15:26,78 --> 0:15:29,52
You might not truly enjoy the fruits of it.

501
0:15:29,52 --> 0:15:31,76
You’re just seen as good in others' eyes.

502
0:15:32,96 --> 0:15:35,25
All those people I admire,

503
0:15:35,65 --> 0:15:37,17
All those people I admire,

504
0:15:37,17 --> 0:15:38,9
Do they even know I admire them?

505
0:15:38,9 --> 0:15:40,94
Those who drive better cars than me

506
0:15:40,94 --> 0:15:42,16
Do they know I envy them?

507
0:15:42,16 --> 0:15:46,149
The ones driving luxury cars like the Cullinan or Maybach

508
0:15:46,149 --> 0:15:49,289
Aren't there plenty of people driving Porsches and Ferraris?

509
0:15:49,289 --> 0:15:50,609
Do they have three horns?

510
0:15:50,609 --> 0:15:52,37
Don't they also have to go through birth, aging, illness, and death?

511
0:15:52,37 --> 0:15:54,89
So why do you have to drive a car with a large engine?

512
0:15:54,89 --> 0:15:56,32
Why do you have to drive a luxury car?

513
0:15:56,32 --> 0:15:58,4
Why does the number of followers have to increase?

514
0:15:58,4 --> 0:15:59,56
Why do you have to attend Tsinghua or Peking University?

515
0:15:59,56 --> 0:16:1,68
Why do you have to be the best among your peers?

516
0:16:1,68 --> 0:16:3,84
Why does your why have to be longer than everyone else’s?

517
0:16:3,84 --> 0:16:4,68
Are you crazy?

518
0:16:4,68 --> 0:16:6,57
Are you okay?

519
0:16:6,57 --> 0:16:8,11
If you keep talking like that, you’re the one who’s crazy.

520
0:16:8,11 --> 0:16:8,97
Right?

521
0:16:8,97 --> 0:16:11,41
Why do you have to be better than others?

522
0:16:11,41 --> 0:16:12,63
That’s just the Chinese mindset.

523
0:16:12,63 --> 0:16:14,37
Sometimes I really don’t get it

524
0:16:14,37 --> 0:16:16,109
We must be the best in the world

525
0:16:16,109 --> 0:16:19,149
Our standards are higher than Japan’s

526
0:16:19,149 --> 0:16:20,609
Are the Japanese really that well-mannered?

527
0:16:20,609 --> 0:16:22,509
If they were more sophisticated, they wouldn’t engage in violence and looting

528
0:16:22,509 --> 0:16:23,3
Isn’t that right?

529
0:16:23,3 --> 0:16:25,48
Our engineering technology must surpass Germany’s

530
0:16:25,48 --> 0:16:27,54
The Germans have a lot of experience in dealing with people

531
0:16:27,54 --> 0:16:28,32
Right?

532
0:16:28,32 --> 0:16:30,14
The economy is stronger than that of the U.S.

533
0:16:30,14 --> 0:16:32,68
The military power exceeds that of Russia.

534
0:16:32,68 --> 0:16:34,4
Do you really think Russia's military power is high?

535
0:16:34,4 --> 0:16:36,44
Is the U.S. economy really that great?

536
0:16:36,44 --> 0:16:39,319
Sometimes, you know, things aren't as they seem.

537
0:16:39,319 --> 0:16:42,44
Living up to a great reputation can be tough.

538
0:16:42,44 --> 0:16:44,4
Often, things aren't as good as they appear.

539
0:16:44,4 --> 0:16:45,36
You're comparing them in a very direct way.

540
0:16:45,36 --> 0:16:46,6
They give you a fake presentation.

541
0:16:46,6 --> 0:16:47,28
What are you going to do?

542
0:16:47,28 --> 0:16:47,86
Buddy

543
0:16:47,86 --> 0:16:48,9
You're always so pragmatic

544
0:16:48,9 --> 0:16:49,78
You're always chasing

545
0:16:49,78 --> 0:16:51,12
That's the kind of mindset among Chinese people

546
0:16:51,12 --> 0:16:52,2
In terms of military equipment

547
0:16:52,2 --> 0:16:53,72
You can catch up with others in technology

548
0:16:53,72 --> 0:16:55,88
But there are many aspects of quality of life

549
0:16:55,88 --> 0:16:58,0
You might not really need that much

550
0:16:58,0 --> 0:16:58,78
Buddy

551
0:16:58,78 --> 0:17:1,3
Human desires are endless

552
0:17:1,3 --> 0:17:3,4
Don’t use endless desires

553
0:17:3,4 --> 0:17:5,3
to burn through your finite life

554
0:17:5,3 --> 0:17:7,1
and try to satisfy those endless desires

555
0:17:7,1 --> 0:17:8,75
Nature can’t bear it

556
0:17:8,75 --> 0:17:10,37
Your lifespan can’t bear it

557
0:17:10,37 --> 0:17:12,29
Your blessings can’t sustain such heights

558
0:17:12,29 --> 0:17:14,17
125 is enough

559
0:17:14,17 --> 0:17:15,41
Having a few hundred thousand followers

560
0:17:15,41 --> 0:17:17,5
Getting over half a million is really impressive

561
0:17:17,5 --> 0:17:17,679
Dude

562
0:17:17,679 --> 0:17:18,619
To be honest

563
0:17:18,619 --> 0:17:21,199
Now you have a country that's the second largest economy in the world

564
0:17:21,199 --> 0:17:22,579
You're better off than being born in

565
0:17:22,579 --> 0:17:23,779
Bina a soul

566
0:17:23,779 --> 0:17:27,19
There's no way Burundi can compare to South India

567
0:17:27,19 --> 0:17:28,859
Dude, based on the current birth rate

568
0:17:28,859 --> 0:17:29,859
If you were to be reincarnated

569
0:17:29,859 --> 0:17:31,989
you'd likely be born in India

570
0:17:32,269 --> 0:17:33,309
so being born in China

571
0:17:33,309 --> 0:17:34,309
isn't that great?

572
0:17:34,309 --> 0:17:36,69
I'm not saying everything is perfect in China

573
0:17:36,69 --> 0:17:37,309
China is fantastic in many ways

574
0:17:37,309 --> 0:17:38,469
I think coming to China is particularly great

575
0:17:38,469 --> 0:17:39,84
I'm someone like Flav

576
0:17:39,84 --> 0:17:40,92
I'm not that kind of person either

577
0:17:40,92 --> 0:17:42,16
But let's be honest

578
0:17:42,16 --> 0:17:46,13
You shouldn't always compare economic downturn data with economic upturn data

579
0:17:46,13 --> 0:17:47,77
You keep bringing up Sister Lotus

580
0:17:47,77 --> 0:17:51,63
Comparing her with Lin, oh

581
0:17:51,63 --> 0:17:52,43
I've forgotten who else

582
0:17:52,43 --> 0:17:53,83
But anyway, comparing her with those beautiful ones

583
0:17:53,83 --> 0:17:55,23
It's not necessary

584
0:17:55,23 --> 0:17:57,75
Why compare your weakest with others' strongest

585
0:17:57,75 --> 0:17:59,31
It's like the story of Tian Ji's horse racing

586
0:17:59,31 --> 0:18:1,22
You're really out of your mind.

587
0:18:1,22 --> 0:18:3,72
Is it because you always compare your weaknesses with others' strengths?

588
0:18:3,72 --> 0:18:5,4
You never really think about it.

589
0:18:5,4 --> 0:18:7,98
What are your strengths?

590
0:18:7,98 --> 0:18:9,66
Sometimes I don't think about it either.

591
0:18:9,66 --> 0:18:11,72
I always feel that my self-media isn't doing well.

592
0:18:11,72 --> 0:18:13,76
But I scored 8.5 in IELTS.

593
0:18:13,76 --> 0:18:16,15
My buddy got 29 in TOEFL.

594
0:18:16,15 --> 0:18:17,99
Who's better than you in English exams?

595
0:18:17,99 --> 0:18:18,81
Now you think that...

596
0:18:18,81 --> 0:18:20,68
Others have better French literature than me.

597
0:18:20,68 --> 0:18:22,88
But didn't you know French 15 years ago?

598
0:18:22,88 --> 0:18:24,24
They only got good at it recently.

599
0:18:24,24 --> 0:18:25,2
If you study a bit more,

600
0:18:25,2 --> 0:18:26,16
You might be even better.

601
0:18:26,16 --> 0:18:27,4
But why do you have to be better than him?

602
0:18:27,4 --> 0:18:29,1
Can't you just use it and be done with it?

603
0:18:29,1 --> 0:18:30,45
He needs to use French now.

604
0:18:30,45 --> 0:18:31,25
So his French is good.

605
0:18:31,25 --> 0:18:32,53
You don't need to use French now.

606
0:18:32,53 --> 0:18:33,99
Why does your French have to be better than others?

607
0:18:33,99 --> 0:18:35,45
Let me ask you something.

608
0:18:35,45 --> 0:18:37,47
Why do I have to be better than others?

609
0:18:37,47 --> 0:18:39,35
Why does my... have to be bigger than others?

610
0:18:39,35 --> 0:18:41,33
Why can't I have hair loss?

611
0:18:41,33 --> 0:18:43,11
Why do I have to be thinner than others?

612
0:18:43,11 --> 0:18:44,77
Why do I have to be more handsome than others?

613
0:18:44,77 --> 0:18:46,9
Why do I have to have more money than others?

614
0:18:46,9 --> 0:18:47,58
Why does my house have to be bigger than others?

615
0:18:47,58 --> 0:18:49,26
Why does the engine displacement have to be high?

616
0:18:49,26 --> 0:18:50,8
Why do I have so many followers?

617
0:18:50,8 --> 0:18:53,42
Why do I have to live in the top country in the world?

618
0:18:53,42 --> 0:18:54,92
I must be crazy.

619
0:18:54,92 --> 0:18:56,12
Am I crazy?

620
0:18:56,12 --> 0:18:59,12
Is there something wrong with my brain?

621
0:18:59,12 --> 0:19:1,2
I have to go to Tsinghua or Peking University.

622
0:19:1,2 --> 0:19:2,88
I have to attend a key high school.

623
0:19:2,88 --> 0:19:4,12
I have to be the top of my grade.

624
0:19:4,12 --> 0:19:5,14
Being second is unacceptable.

625
0:19:5,14 --> 0:19:6,4
If I have 100 points,

626
0:19:6,4 --> 0:19:6,84
I have to score 100.

627
0:19:6,84 --> 0:19:7,28
If I score 99,

628
0:19:7,28 --> 0:19:8,22
My dad would scold me.

629
0:19:8,22 --> 0:19:9,73
Isn't that crazy?

630
0:19:9,73 --> 0:19:11,65
Is there something wrong with my mindset?

631
0:19:11,65 --> 0:19:13,9
Am I psychologically disturbed?

632
0:19:13,9 --> 0:19:15,13
Is there something wrong with my mental state?

633
0:19:15,13 --> 0:19:17,51
That's why I'm not happy.

634
0:19:17,51 --> 0:19:19,23
Is that the problem?

635
0:19:19,23 --> 0:19:20,59
So, buddy, think it through.

636
0:19:20,59 --> 0:19:22,23
It's a mindset issue.

637
0:19:22,23 --> 0:19:23,55
Just an engine displacement,

638
0:19:23,55 --> 0:19:25,37
Why do you always compare?

639
0:19:25,37 --> 0:19:26,67
Always comparing who's bigger,

640
0:19:26,67 --> 0:19:28,1
Always comparing who has more hair,

641
0:19:28,1 --> 0:19:29,69
Always comparing who can stay young longer,

642
0:19:29,69 --> 0:19:32,58
Bro, I'm already on a downhill slope.

643
0:19:32,58 --> 0:19:35,4
Aging is a natural law, okay?

644
0:19:35,4 --> 0:19:37,81
Is it normal to have more hair than 24 people now?

645
0:19:37,81 --> 0:19:39,9
Of course, in some places,

646
0:19:39,9 --> 0:19:41,49
The hair is definitely more than the others, right?

647
0:19:41,49 --> 0:19:43,41
Of course, you can't see that part anyway.

648
0:19:43,41 --> 0:19:43,87
Right?

649
0:19:43,87 --> 0:19:46,7
So don't compare yourself with others.

650
0:19:46,7 --> 0:19:47,7
Let me say it again,

651
0:19:47,7 --> 0:19:49,21
Comparison is the thief of joy.

652
0:19:49,21 --> 0:19:51,27
Comparison is the thief of joy.

653
0:19:51,27 --> 0:19:52,47
Never compare yourself with others.

654
0:19:52,47 --> 0:19:54,76
You'll be happy as long as you don't compare.
