0:0:0,9 --> 0:0:1,34
Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,34 --> 0:0:3,42
I've been getting more and more into filming with my phone lately

3
0:0:3,42 --> 0:0:4,7
There's this really strange thing

4
0:0:4,7 --> 0:0:8,1
which is that usually when I turn on the camera, I also turn on the flashlight

5
0:0:8,1 --> 0:0:9,889
and then get ready

6
0:0:9,889 --> 0:0:11,49
and then grab the memory card

7
0:0:11,49 --> 0:0:13,109
and put it into the computer to edit

8
0:0:13,109 --> 0:0:14,81
and it just feels so cumbersome

9
0:0:14,81 --> 0:0:17,79
In this episode, I'm going to talk about a very simple fact

10
0:0:17,79 --> 0:0:21,1
It's an issue that many scholars tend to overlook

11
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:22,42
Speaking of Bilibili

12
0:0:22,42 --> 0:0:25,48
a lot of the users are actually college students

13
0:0:25,48 --> 0:0:27,86
who have moved on from high school to university

14
0:0:27,86 --> 0:0:28,56
to be honest

15
0:0:28,56 --> 0:0:31,64
back in high school, you didn't really

16
0:0:31,64 --> 0:0:32,72
get into fights or fall in love

17
0:0:32,72 --> 0:0:34,519
these kinds of things happened less often

18
0:0:34,519 --> 0:0:36,719
one particular skill might have been practiced less

19
0:0:36,719 --> 0:0:38,879
Your skills in verbal confrontation might

20
0:0:38,879 --> 0:0:42,6
not be as good as those with lower educational backgrounds.

21
0:0:42,6 --> 0:0:43,98
However, when entering society,

22
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:46,6
it’s still important to show a certain level of assertiveness.

23
0:0:46,6 --> 0:0:47,94
If you’re not assertive

24
0:0:47,94 --> 0:0:49,4
and don’t stand up for yourself,

25
0:0:49,4 --> 0:0:50,1
if you’re overly polite,

26
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:52,42
you might become everyone’s target.

27
0:0:52,42 --> 0:0:54,87
All the tough and exhausting tasks will be assigned to you.

28
0:0:54,87 --> 0:0:56,55
Why release aggression?

29
0:0:56,55 --> 0:0:57,3
It's simple.

30
0:0:57,3 --> 0:0:58,63
Everyone has read 'The Prince', right?

31
0:0:58,63 --> 0:0:59,87
I recommend everyone read 'The Prince'.

32
0:0:59,87 --> 0:1:1,17
In 'The Prince', there is a point that

33
0:1:1,17 --> 0:1:3,8
the cost of betraying a kind person is low.

34
0:1:3,8 --> 0:1:5,8
But if you want to betray someone who is extremely wicked,

35
0:1:5,8 --> 0:1:6,64
you need to betray them,

36
0:1:6,64 --> 0:1:8,4
you usually have to weigh the cost.

37
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:9,76
It's the same with human society.

38
0:1:9,76 --> 0:1:11,68
People tend to seek benefits and avoid harm.

39
0:1:11,68 --> 0:1:13,2
Once someone is particularly ruthless,

40
0:1:13,2 --> 0:1:14,3
extremely fierce,

41
0:1:14,3 --> 0:1:15,15
and downright wicked,

42
0:1:15,15 --> 0:1:16,55
if you think about bullying them,

43
0:1:16,55 --> 0:1:17,35
you need to think twice.

44
0:1:17,35 --> 0:1:19,229
Kind people are often seen as easy targets.

45
0:1:19,229 --> 0:1:21,989
So once you're labeled as a good person,

46
0:1:21,989 --> 0:1:23,149
You are helpful.

47
0:1:23,149 --> 0:1:24,529
You care about your colleagues.

48
0:1:24,529 --> 0:1:26,309
You are willing to contribute.

49
0:1:26,309 --> 0:1:31,8
Then you become the one everyone relies on.

50
0:1:31,8 --> 0:1:32,68
No matter if you have a boyfriend or girlfriend,

51
0:1:32,68 --> 0:1:34,6
people might see you as someone who can be taken advantage of.

52
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:36,6
And this will continue over time.

53
0:1:36,6 --> 0:1:38,96
They will keep testing you.

54
0:1:38,96 --> 0:1:40,78
The first thing they test is

55
0:1:40,78 --> 0:1:41,96
Do something trivial

56
0:1:41,96 --> 0:1:43,27
And then slap you

57
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:44,47
If you don’t fight back

58
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:45,55
You still laugh it off

59
0:1:45,55 --> 0:1:47,43
People will treat you worse in the future

60
0:1:47,43 --> 0:1:48,35
That’s just how people are

61
0:1:48,35 --> 0:1:50,63
They bully those who are easy to bully

62
0:1:50,63 --> 0:1:52,35
No matter what kind of person

63
0:1:52,35 --> 0:1:53,23
Regardless of good or bad

64
0:1:53,23 --> 0:1:54,25
Regardless of strength

65
0:1:54,25 --> 0:1:56,49
He will go out and bully others

66
0:1:56,49 --> 0:1:59,39
So you don't have to take it too seriously

67
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:1,39
Sometimes, being the bad guy

68
0:2:1,39 --> 0:2:3,99
Being someone with a stronger aggressive streak

69
0:2:3,99 --> 0:2:5,13
No matter what

70
0:2:5,13 --> 0:2:7,1
Even if it's just a matter of attitude

71
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:9,29
You'll find that the people who hassle you

72
0:2:9,29 --> 0:2:12,18
Those who make all sorts of demands on you, will suddenly decrease

73
0:2:12,18 --> 0:2:15,24
This is also a kind of wisdom and strategy for survival.

74
0:2:15,24 --> 0:2:17,84
It's not that we are inherently supposed to be a certain way.

75
0:2:17,84 --> 0:2:19,4
But in everyday life,

76
0:2:19,4 --> 0:2:20,99
you see me often scolding people on my social media.

77
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:22,19
Frequently scolding people,

78
0:2:22,19 --> 0:2:23,41
surely doesn't have a good effect.

79
0:2:23,41 --> 0:2:25,27
If leaders or teachers see it, they definitely won't think highly of it.

80
0:2:25,27 --> 0:2:26,67
But the issue is precisely this.

81
0:2:26,67 --> 0:2:28,23
My promotion

82
0:2:28,23 --> 0:2:32,34
Does my career development require the concern of leaders and teachers?

83
0:2:32,46 --> 0:2:33,58
No, it doesn't.

84
0:2:33,58 --> 0:2:37,61
So, I don't need to respect these people in my interpersonal relationships.

85
0:2:37,61 --> 0:2:40,67
I have a one-on-one relationship with everyone.

86
0:2:40,67 --> 0:2:43,88
People like me, who are so ruthless and vicious,

87
0:2:43,88 --> 0:2:45,52
who are quick to criticize others,

88
0:2:45,52 --> 0:2:47,66
actually find it easier to build relationships with others.

89
0:2:47,66 --> 0:2:48,85
Some people might say

90
0:2:48,85 --> 0:2:50,39
Won't you alienate others this way?

91
0:2:50,39 --> 0:2:52,94
Actually, this is still a psychological issue for humans.

92
0:2:52,94 --> 0:2:54,78
Someone like me, who is so ruthless and vicious,

93
0:2:54,78 --> 0:2:57,39
who gets furious for no reason,

94
0:2:57,39 --> 0:2:59,81
suddenly starts being nice to others,

95
0:2:59,81 --> 0:3:2,74
suddenly starts speaking to others with exceptional patience,

96
0:3:2,74 --> 0:3:4,5
others will feel greatly respected,

97
0:3:4,5 --> 0:3:7,24
because such a person with a bad temper,

98
0:3:7,24 --> 0:3:11,92
a person with a bad temper actually shows me such respect,

99
0:3:11,92 --> 0:3:13,839
is exceptionally courteous.

100
0:3:13,839 --> 0:3:15,439
This person is so hard to approach

101
0:3:15,439 --> 0:3:17,219
but he's very kind to me

102
0:3:17,219 --> 0:3:19,339
he feels special about himself

103
0:3:19,339 --> 0:3:20,999
it's like when you were in middle school

104
0:3:20,999 --> 0:3:23,41
suddenly someone knows a big brother from outside school

105
0:3:23,41 --> 0:3:25,53
this big brother acts all high and mighty to others

106
0:3:25,53 --> 0:3:27,11
but when you help him with his homework

107
0:3:27,11 --> 0:3:29,35
you find out he's really nice to you

108
0:3:29,35 --> 0:3:31,19
and you feel really proud of it

109
0:3:31,19 --> 0:3:32,35
Look at all of you

110
0:3:32,35 --> 0:3:35,399
trembling in fear in front of the big brother

111
0:3:35,399 --> 0:3:36,719
but when I'm in front of the big brother

112
0:3:36,719 --> 0:3:38,719
I'm his best little brother

113
0:3:38,719 --> 0:3:40,54
I might not show it in front of him

114
0:3:40,54 --> 0:3:43,0
but behind his back, everyone calls me the teacher

115
0:3:43,0 --> 0:3:43,92
it's this kind of feeling

116
0:3:43,92 --> 0:3:45,48
a lot of times it's like this

117
0:3:45,48 --> 0:3:47,74
the more you seem hard to approach

118
0:3:47,74 --> 0:3:51,24
People who interact with you will feel highly respected.

119
0:3:51,24 --> 0:3:52,34
Exactly.

120
0:3:52,34 --> 0:3:54,4
Often times,

121
0:3:54,4 --> 0:3:54,64
Let me tell you,

122
0:3:54,64 --> 0:3:55,74
The path of life,

123
0:3:55,74 --> 0:3:58,24
is not always laid out in books.

124
0:3:58,24 --> 0:4:0,72
A lot of things are learned through practice.

125
0:4:0,72 --> 0:4:3,36
You'll see if it really works out in practice.

126
0:4:3,36 --> 0:4:6,23
Often, things don't turn out that way in practice.

127
0:4:6,23 --> 0:4:9,41
In practice, you often have to endure hardships.

128
0:4:9,41 --> 0:4:10,77
You have to face setbacks.

129
0:4:10,77 --> 0:4:12,2
You have to make compromises.

130
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:13,82
Why do books write it that way?

131
0:4:13,82 --> 0:4:15,92
Because books are for the majority.

132
0:4:15,92 --> 0:4:19,38
The true experiences of a select few are different.

133
0:4:19,38 --> 0:4:20,58
So this tells you,

134
0:4:20,58 --> 0:4:22,54
Why being a good person in society

135
0:4:22,54 --> 0:4:23,46
is often risky.

136
0:4:23,46 --> 0:4:25,98
It's like being a herbivore in nature

137
0:4:25,98 --> 0:4:27,6
You don't have any aggression

138
0:4:27,6 --> 0:4:28,34
You lose everything

139
0:4:28,34 --> 0:4:30,72
Because humans are still, at heart, wild animals

140
0:4:30,72 --> 0:4:33,0
Still more animalistic in nature

141
0:4:33,0 --> 0:4:35,1
Humans still have the urge to reproduce and mate

142
0:4:35,1 --> 0:4:37,36
And various desires and needs for competition and conflict

143
0:4:37,36 --> 0:4:38,48
In this society

144
0:4:38,48 --> 0:4:39,4
What stance do you take

145
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:41,5
This determines what kind of species you are

146
0:4:41,5 --> 0:4:42,7
It's the same for people

147
0:4:42,7 --> 0:4:44,44
First, they conform to the laws of the universe

148
0:4:44,44 --> 0:4:45,36
The laws of nature

149
0:4:45,36 --> 0:4:46,2
The laws of the jungle

150
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:49,1
And finally, human moral standards and such

151
0:4:49,1 --> 0:4:51,54
Human moral standards are for educating people

152
0:4:51,54 --> 0:4:53,14
For governing society

153
0:4:53,14 --> 0:4:56,61
To ensure that society is relatively stable, harmonious, and progresses forward

154
0:4:56,61 --> 0:4:58,35
He is indifferent to individual rises and falls.

155
0:4:58,35 --> 0:4:59,49
He doesn't care about them.

156
0:4:59,49 --> 0:5:2,9
So, a rule established by usage in society

157
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:4,299
exists to ensure social stability.

158
0:5:4,299 --> 0:5:6,659
But when it comes to your personal development,

159
0:5:6,659 --> 0:5:8,939
you can't follow the norms that maintain stability.

160
0:5:8,939 --> 0:5:9,6
Do you understand?

161
0:5:9,6 --> 0:5:11,88
Because stability means no change in structure,

162
0:5:11,88 --> 0:5:14,53
but your personal development requires structural changes.

163
0:5:14,53 --> 0:5:17,25
However, in a plant, nutrients move gradually from the roots up through the stem and leaves.

164
0:5:17,25 --> 0:5:19,77
So you need to understand that

165
0:5:19,77 --> 0:5:20,84
from the perspective of your personal development,

166
0:5:20,84 --> 0:5:22,58
the way of the world is to take advantage of the situation and act against it.

167
0:5:22,58 --> 0:5:24,82
No matter what,

168
0:5:24,82 --> 0:5:26,4
many of my new followers,

169
0:5:26,4 --> 0:5:27,6
no matter what,

170
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:28,38
you often have to go against conventional wisdom

171
0:5:28,38 --> 0:5:31,43
to achieve remarkable results.

172
0:5:31,43 --> 0:5:33,67
Otherwise, you'll spend your whole life stuck in your current situation,

173
0:5:33,67 --> 0:5:36,39
unable to advance to a higher level.

174
0:5:36,39 --> 0:5:39,4
There's no way to move up in this class.
