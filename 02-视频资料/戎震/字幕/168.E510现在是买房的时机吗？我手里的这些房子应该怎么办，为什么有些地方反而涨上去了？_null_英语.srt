0:0:0,18 --> 0:0:1,28
Hey everyone,

2
0:0:1,28 --> 0:0:4,5
This is either the 509th or 517th window chat.

3
0:0:4,5 --> 0:0:5,1
Let's chat.

4
0:0:5,1 --> 0:0:8,8
In this episode, we're going to discuss a rather profound issue.

5
0:0:8,8 --> 0:0:11,879
That is, whether it's a good idea to buy a house these days.

6
0:0:11,879 --> 0:0:14,219
I'm creating this series of videos

7
0:0:14,219 --> 0:0:18,119
At the beginning, as you all know, I strongly advise against taking on debt.

8
0:0:18,119 --> 0:0:19,88
to purchase assets.

9
0:0:19,88 --> 0:0:22,24
Because back then, assets were losing value.

10
0:0:22,24 --> 0:0:23,24
It's all shrinking

11
0:0:23,24 --> 0:0:25,98
This means the price of the asset is going down

12
0:0:25,98 --> 0:0:28,6
But now, after a couple of years

13
0:0:28,6 --> 0:0:30,36
This change

14
0:0:30,36 --> 0:0:33,23
All these markets are evolving

15
0:0:33,23 --> 0:0:36,1
You'll notice that in some areas, housing prices are still on the rise

16
0:0:36,1 --> 0:0:38,11
For instance, in cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen

17
0:0:38,11 --> 0:0:41,5
And in new housing in the top 20 income-generating central cities

18
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:42,44
They are still increasing

19
0:0:42,44 --> 0:0:43,56
When it comes to this

20
0:0:43,56 --> 0:0:45,44
on one hand, it's the national policy

21
0:0:45,44 --> 0:0:48,28
and on the other hand, the international situation is changing

22
0:0:48,28 --> 0:0:50,79
Let's talk about the national policies

23
0:0:50,79 --> 0:0:52,11
To put it simply

24
0:0:52,11 --> 0:0:53,29
it's crucial to stabilize housing prices

25
0:0:53,29 --> 0:0:55,71
to ensure timely delivery of housing

26
0:0:55,71 --> 0:0:59,65
the government has spent a lot of money buying properties

27
0:0:59,65 --> 0:1:2,89
after purchasing, they serve as policy-based affordable housing

28
0:1:2,89 --> 0:1:6,55
Affordable housing is a significant investment in this area.

29
0:1:6,55 --> 0:1:8,95
In the current context,

30
0:1:8,95 --> 0:1:11,9
what we're doing is stabilizing housing prices.

31
0:1:11,9 --> 0:1:13,1
We don't want them to drop further.

32
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:16,34
However, if we look at a steady upward trend,

33
0:1:16,34 --> 0:1:17,78
it varies by region,

34
0:1:17,78 --> 0:1:19,509
It's also categorized.

35
0:1:19,509 --> 0:1:22,309
So, you need to understand the current international situation.

36
0:1:22,309 --> 0:1:23,389
The current international situation

37
0:1:23,389 --> 0:1:24,309
By 2025

38
0:1:24,309 --> 0:1:25,789
how should I put it, the international situation

39
0:1:25,789 --> 0:1:28,14
has already been in a very unstable state

40
0:1:28,14 --> 0:1:30,66
which means a lot of international capital

41
0:1:30,66 --> 0:1:34,14
is looking for a relatively stable economy

42
0:1:34,14 --> 0:1:37,91
assets with higher preservation value

43
0:1:37,91 --> 0:1:38,99
to invest in

44
0:1:38,99 --> 0:1:41,29
so this has led to some areas in our country

45
0:1:41,29 --> 0:1:42,57
especially the first-tier cities

46
0:1:42,57 --> 0:1:46,69
The housing prices in the core areas of new first-tier cities are still on the rise.

47
0:1:46,69 --> 0:1:49,3
In other words, what exactly qualifies as a high-quality asset?

48
0:1:49,3 --> 0:1:51,52
I've mentioned this to you before.

49
0:1:51,52 --> 0:1:53,12
What constitutes core value?

50
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:54,4
It's the high-quality assets.

51
0:1:54,4 --> 0:1:56,34
Jobs that attract a net inflow of population,

52
0:1:56,34 --> 0:1:58,62
relatively speaking, offer more opportunities,

53
0:1:58,62 --> 0:2:1,7
and have a higher frequency of population movement.

54
0:2:1,7 --> 0:2:3,38
Cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen definitely fit this description.

55
0:2:3,38 --> 0:2:5,46
Then add the top 20 cities in China

56
0:2:5,46 --> 0:2:8,38
For example, Wuhan

57
0:2:8,38 --> 0:2:9,48
Changsha

58
0:2:9,48 --> 0:2:12,4
Changsha's prices are slightly lower

59
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:13,66
Chongqing and Chengdu

60
0:2:13,66 --> 0:2:14,72
Hangzhou and Suzhou

61
0:2:14,72 --> 0:2:15,78
Places like these

62
0:2:15,78 --> 0:2:16,93
Xiamen

63
0:2:16,93 --> 0:2:18,37
Many sub-provincial cities

64
0:2:18,37 --> 0:2:20,41
For cities like Dalian and Qingdao

65
0:2:20,41 --> 0:2:21,77
they are actually on the rise

66
0:2:21,77 --> 0:2:23,24
especially in the core areas

67
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:27,24
but when we talk about the changes in improvement-oriented housing

68
0:2:27,24 --> 0:2:28,72
it generally revolves around 90 square meters

69
0:2:28,72 --> 0:2:30,18
there is a significant difference

70
0:2:30,18 --> 0:2:32,86
many units below 90 square meters are being sold off

71
0:2:32,86 --> 0:2:35,34
so why are the prices of second-hand homes falling now

72
0:2:35,34 --> 0:2:36,1
because of the second-hand homes

73
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:37,77
To put it bluntly, the price

74
0:2:37,77 --> 0:2:39,77
Real estate developers have already made their profit

75
0:2:39,77 --> 0:2:40,61
So they don't really care anymore

76
0:2:40,61 --> 0:2:41,83
Now the focus is on protecting new homes

77
0:2:41,83 --> 0:2:44,45
So the price of new homes is on the rise

78
0:2:44,45 --> 0:2:46,269
While the price of second-hand homes is dropping

79
0:2:46,269 --> 0:2:48,749
And for properties in tier 2, 3, 4, and 5 cities

80
0:2:48,749 --> 0:2:50,829
The overall trend is a decline

81
0:2:50,829 --> 0:2:52,29
But for new first-tier cities

82
0:2:52,29 --> 0:2:53,85
Housing prices in first-tier cities are on the rise.

83
0:2:53,85 --> 0:2:56,73
So you need to consider this trend.

84
0:2:56,73 --> 0:2:58,69
You should look at the trend over the next two to three years.

85
0:2:58,69 --> 0:3:1,42
We originally talked about the third quarter of 20227.

86
0:3:1,42 --> 0:3:4,829
Hurun says the turning point will be in the third quarter of 2027.

87
0:3:4,829 --> 0:3:7,549
But now, due to the international market,

88
0:3:7,549 --> 0:3:10,69
various funds are flowing in,

89
0:3:10,69 --> 0:3:12,249
and there are many policy changes,

90
0:3:12,249 --> 0:3:16,99
if you need to buy some investment properties now.

91
0:3:16,99 --> 0:3:18,67
Or if you're buying out of necessity

92
0:3:18,67 --> 0:3:22,32
I suggest you purchase core assets in major cities

93
0:3:22,32 --> 0:3:23,76
Core assets in major cities

94
0:3:23,76 --> 0:3:24,96
And it’s best to buy new properties

95
0:3:24,96 --> 0:3:26,16
Because their value is on the rise

96
0:3:26,16 --> 0:3:28,269
Because it’s a positive cycle

97
0:3:28,269 --> 0:3:31,47
If what you hold is, how to put it

98
0:3:31,47 --> 0:3:33,37
In a particularly remote area

99
0:3:33,37 --> 0:3:34,43
In a particularly remote city

100
0:3:34,43 --> 0:3:36,35
a large house in a very remote area

101
0:3:36,35 --> 0:3:37,79
you should act quickly

102
0:3:37,79 --> 0:3:38,83
because in this market

103
0:3:38,83 --> 0:3:39,91
it doesn’t wait for anyone

104
0:3:39,91 --> 0:3:42,23
by the time it plummets to rock bottom

105
0:3:42,23 --> 0:3:42,91
it won’t be of any use

106
0:3:42,91 --> 0:3:45,11
because for many people buying a house

107
0:3:45,11 --> 0:3:47,64
it’s about living in this place

108
0:3:47,64 --> 0:3:48,56
this is where they belong

109
0:3:48,56 --> 0:3:49,58
I’ll buy a set when I get married

110
0:3:49,58 --> 0:3:51,6
or I’ll buy one when I have a child

111
0:3:51,6 --> 0:3:52,8
That’s right

112
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:53,12
It’s a gradual improvement

113
0:3:53,12 --> 0:3:54,24
But when you buy something like this

114
0:3:54,24 --> 0:3:57,0
it’s not cost-effective given your core values

115
0:3:57,0 --> 0:3:58,1
There’s nothing we can do about it

116
0:3:58,1 --> 0:4:1,18
What I mean is, don’t worry about job opportunities for now

117
0:4:1,18 --> 0:4:5,269
and don’t worry about the actual value of your property either

118
0:4:5,269 --> 0:4:7,289
Now, how would you put it?

119
0:4:7,289 --> 0:4:9,44
Unless you have stable numbers like that.

120
0:4:9,44 --> 0:4:10,52
A nomadic lifestyle.

121
0:4:10,52 --> 0:4:12,4
You can completely disregard such matters.

122
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:14,12
In that case, you'd be living in a rented place.

123
0:4:14,12 --> 0:4:16,149
But if you start a family,

124
0:4:16,149 --> 0:4:16,829
get married,

125
0:4:16,829 --> 0:4:19,349
you often need to know that these things require,

126
0:4:19,349 --> 0:4:20,589
having a stable property.

127
0:4:20,589 --> 0:4:22,869
So I suggest you try to

128
0:4:22,869 --> 0:4:24,78
For example, if you're in this situation

129
0:4:24,78 --> 0:4:25,76
If you're in a small county town

130
0:4:25,76 --> 0:4:26,74
If you're in a fifth-tier city

131
0:4:26,74 --> 0:4:27,18
A third-tier city

132
0:4:27,18 --> 0:4:27,8
A fourth-tier city

133
0:4:27,8 --> 0:4:29,2
Your family has left you quite a few properties

134
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:30,1
Four or five properties

135
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:31,8
Six or seven properties

136
0:4:31,8 --> 0:4:34,64
So, your current move should be to offload these items as soon as possible.

137
0:4:34,64 --> 0:4:35,64
To get the funds back.

138
0:4:35,64 --> 0:4:37,12
If your family isn’t willing to do that,

139
0:4:37,12 --> 0:4:38,83
how should you approach the situation?

140
0:4:38,83 --> 0:4:40,53
Well, it’s down to your luck then.

141
0:4:40,53 --> 0:4:43,59
Especially now, there’s a chance to buy property in some key cities,

142
0:4:43,59 --> 0:4:44,55
in major metropolitan areas,

143
0:4:44,55 --> 0:4:47,1
you should seize the opportunity and make the purchase.

144
0:4:47,1 --> 0:4:49,21
So, if you can convert what you have,

145
0:4:49,21 --> 0:4:51,7
I'm not talking about people who don't have money now

146
0:4:51,7 --> 0:4:51,75
don't force it

147
0:4:51,75 --> 0:4:52,57
that's not what I mean

148
0:4:52,57 --> 0:4:53,45
if you don't have money now

149
0:4:53,45 --> 0:4:54,59
then don't buy it

150
0:4:54,59 --> 0:4:55,82
don't force it

151
0:4:55,82 --> 0:4:56,7
what I'm saying is

152
0:4:56,7 --> 0:5:0,36
if you're in a remote area of a third, fourth, fifth, or sixth-tier city

153
0:5:0,36 --> 0:5:3,22
or large areas of this type of housing

154
0:5:3,22 --> 0:5:5,26
You should consider moving to a core city now.

155
0:5:5,26 --> 0:5:8,12
A prime area or a core city.

156
0:5:8,12 --> 0:5:9,8
Preferably a core city.

157
0:5:9,8 --> 0:5:9,88
If not, a prime area.

158
0:5:9,88 --> 0:5:13,82
Buy a house larger than 90 square meters in the central area of a core city.

159
0:5:13,82 --> 0:5:15,2
Speaking of which,

160
0:5:15,2 --> 0:5:17,34
From the perspective of asset appreciation,

161
0:5:17,34 --> 0:5:18,3
This is a suitable choice.

162
0:5:18,3 --> 0:5:20,37
It might not be appropriate from other perspectives.

163
0:5:20,37 --> 0:5:21,71
Of course, you might say

164
0:5:21,71 --> 0:5:23,73
I'm not familiar with this city either

165
0:5:23,73 --> 0:5:25,13
but if he can get you to buy

166
0:5:25,13 --> 0:5:26,85
and if you have the potential to grow

167
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:30,59
it would be best to tie yourself to one of the top 20 cities

168
0:5:30,59 --> 0:5:32,82
I wouldn't recommend it for the average person

169
0:5:32,82 --> 0:5:36,58
to go to places where resources and population are relatively scarce

170
0:5:36,58 --> 0:5:39,26
unless you're in a field like ours, such as media work

171
0:5:39,26 --> 0:5:39,98
or if you're a programmer

172
0:5:39,98 --> 0:5:41,4
You are a designer.

173
0:5:41,4 --> 0:5:44,0
You are involved in something unrelated to urban services.

174
0:5:44,0 --> 0:5:46,16
But I still recommend that everyone

175
0:5:46,16 --> 0:5:47,28
in the next two or three decades,

176
0:5:47,28 --> 0:5:50,83
focus on moving to major cities with growing populations.

177
0:5:50,88 --> 0:5:52,4
Previously, we talked about starting businesses back home,

178
0:5:52,4 --> 0:5:53,2
but now,

179
0:5:53,2 --> 0:5:55,34
many of these ideas are evolving,

180
0:5:55,34 --> 0:5:57,26
they are changing based on your industry.

181
0:5:57,26 --> 0:5:59,94
So, from the perspective of core assets,

182
0:5:59,94 --> 0:6:1,42
it doesn't matter whether you buy or not,

183
0:6:1,42 --> 0:6:2,42
it doesn't matter whether you live in it or not.

184
0:6:2,42 --> 0:6:4,46
If you want to live, you can rent a place.

185
0:6:4,46 --> 0:6:5,74
You can be anywhere,

186
0:6:5,74 --> 0:6:6,9
in a place where the mountains are green and the water is clear,

187
0:6:6,9 --> 0:6:7,54
whether you live there or not,

188
0:6:7,54 --> 0:6:10,22
whether you take photos or videos there doesn't really matter,

189
0:6:10,22 --> 0:6:12,1
but what you should focus on now is

190
0:6:12,1 --> 0:6:14,88
whether your assets are shrinking or growing

191
0:6:14,88 --> 0:6:15,94
this is crucial

192
0:6:15,94 --> 0:6:18,43
if I repeat, if your assets

193
0:6:18,43 --> 0:6:20,63
are small houses in tier 2, 3, 4, or 5 cities

194
0:6:20,63 --> 0:6:21,47
or large houses

195
0:6:21,47 --> 0:6:24,549
or properties in remote areas, you should decisively sell them

196
0:6:24,549 --> 0:6:25,849
and recover your funds

197
0:6:25,849 --> 0:6:28,33
then buy properties in core cities

198
0:6:28,33 --> 0:6:30,49
of course, you can also choose not to buy real estate

199
0:6:30,49 --> 0:6:32,25
You can also invest in other assets.

200
0:6:32,25 --> 0:6:34,36
It all depends on your own luck.

201
0:6:34,36 --> 0:6:36,12
Of course, as Chinese citizens,

202
0:6:36,12 --> 0:6:38,24
as parents in China,

203
0:6:38,24 --> 0:6:39,44
all these people hope

204
0:6:39,44 --> 0:6:43,46
that you still keep some of the money in real estate.

205
0:6:43,46 --> 0:6:44,3
Let me tell you,

206
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:45,34
buy what's on the rise.

207
0:6:45,34 --> 0:6:48,31
Because the key is to buy high and not low.

208
0:6:48,31 --> 0:6:49,83
When it drops, everyone wants to touch it.

209
0:6:49,83 --> 0:6:51,3
When it rises, everyone wants to buy it.

210
0:6:51,3 --> 0:6:52,69
It's that simple.

211
0:6:52,69 --> 0:6:55,93
Right now, some things haven't been fully recognized by the international market.

212
0:6:55,93 --> 0:6:57,63
Once the Russia-Ukraine war ends,

213
0:6:57,63 --> 0:7:0,71
or if it escalates further,

214
0:7:0,71 --> 0:7:2,91
or when the U.S. gets Canada involved,

215
0:7:2,91 --> 0:7:3,89
gets Panama involved,

216
0:7:3,89 --> 0:7:6,11
and makes Greenland even more chaotic.

217
0:7:6,11 --> 0:7:8,59
These international risk-averse funds

218
0:7:8,59 --> 0:7:9,92
where do you think they will go?

219
0:7:9,92 --> 0:7:12,76
Their only option is China.

220
0:7:12,76 --> 0:7:14,96
There’s nowhere else with high-quality assets for them to invest in.

221
0:7:14,96 --> 0:7:16,24
Would they buy Russian assets?

222
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:17,9
Would they buy European ones?

223
0:7:17,9 --> 0:7:19,4
Given the energy crisis in Europe.

224
0:7:19,4 --> 0:7:20,56
Would they buy American assets?

225
0:7:20,56 --> 0:7:22,6
The U.S. is just part of the picture now.

226
0:7:22,6 --> 0:7:24,74
So the only possibility now is the United States.

227
0:7:24,74 --> 0:7:26,549
If it were to annex Mexico,

228
0:7:26,549 --> 0:7:27,629
annexing Mexico,

229
0:7:27,629 --> 0:7:28,669
it could bring manufacturing back,

230
0:7:28,669 --> 0:7:30,189
gaining a large workforce,

231
0:7:30,189 --> 0:7:31,109
a high-quality labor force,

232
0:7:31,109 --> 0:7:32,28
this is possible.

233
0:7:32,28 --> 0:7:35,2
But if he could manage to annex Canada during his term,

234
0:7:35,2 --> 0:7:36,18
annexing Greenland

235
0:7:36,18 --> 0:7:37,0
Annexing Panama

236
0:7:37,0 --> 0:7:38,62
Annexing Mexico

237
0:7:38,62 --> 0:7:39,9
He needs to mobilize a significant amount of resources

238
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:40,94
So it’s not that simple

239
0:7:40,94 --> 0:7:41,82
In the short term

240
0:7:41,82 --> 0:7:43,74
Whether in the next 10 or 20 years

241
0:7:43,74 --> 0:7:47,2
You’ll see that the only choice for international capital seeking safety

242
0:7:47,2 --> 0:7:49,4
Is to buy high-quality Chinese assets

243
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:50,12
Those high-quality Chinese assets

244
0:7:50,12 --> 0:7:52,16
Once people in these areas realize it

245
0:7:52,16 --> 0:7:54,38
you won't be able to buy in bulk anymore

246
0:7:54,38 --> 0:7:55,56
That's the relationship

247
0:7:55,56 --> 0:7:56,48
So, at this point

248
0:7:56,48 --> 0:7:59,61
We used to look at the housing market trends based on supply and demand

249
0:7:59,61 --> 0:8:3,82
We would analyze the domestic market based on supply and demand

250
0:8:3,82 --> 0:8:5,12
Now, we must consider government policies

251
0:8:5,12 --> 0:8:7,61
But now it's crucial to consider the aspects of national policy.

252
0:8:9,45 --> 0:8:11,41
Buying these policy-backed affordable homes

253
0:8:11,41 --> 0:8:12,78
goes on a shopping spree

254
0:8:12,78 --> 0:8:14,38
it will cause a partial increase

255
0:8:14,38 --> 0:8:17,29
not to mention the international rush, like the scarcity of paper in Luoyang

256
0:8:17,29 --> 0:8:18,95
so the saying goes, rarity makes things precious

257
0:8:18,95 --> 0:8:20,59
at that time, temporarily speaking

258
0:8:20,59 --> 0:8:23,94
the purchasing power of our residents, how should I put it

259
0:8:23,94 --> 0:8:25,26
hit its upper limit

260
0:8:25,26 --> 0:8:26,74
at that point, it won't rise anymore

261
0:8:26,74 --> 0:8:28,9
But now the situation has swung back.

262
0:8:28,9 --> 0:8:29,78
Speaking of now,

263
0:8:29,78 --> 0:8:32,73
it means that we, the people of the future,

264
0:8:32,73 --> 0:8:34,23
are betting on the country's upward trajectory once again.

265
0:8:34,23 --> 0:8:35,57
If you bet on the country's upward trajectory,

266
0:8:35,57 --> 0:8:36,45
and you're right,

267
0:8:36,45 --> 0:8:38,47
then the value of prime assets will rise.

268
0:8:38,47 --> 0:8:39,87
If you bet wrong,

269
0:8:39,87 --> 0:8:42,39
there won't be a significant decline in major cities.

270
0:8:42,39 --> 0:8:43,79
So go ahead and buy these things now

271
0:8:43,79 --> 0:8:44,87
they will definitely appreciate in value in the future

272
0:8:44,87 --> 0:8:46,47
and looking ahead

273
0:8:46,47 --> 0:8:48,23
Let's talk about a generation that has vanished.

274
0:8:48,23 --> 0:8:49,19
or two generations from now

275
0:8:49,19 --> 0:8:51,11
when there will be a surplus of properties

276
0:8:51,11 --> 0:8:52,15
a lot of houses

277
0:8:52,15 --> 0:8:53,31
like the one I'm in now

278
0:8:53,31 --> 0:8:55,27
which is over 40 years old

279
0:8:55,27 --> 0:8:56,41
over 30 years

280
0:8:56,41 --> 0:8:59,17
what you buy now will be over the next 10 to 20 years

281
0:8:59,17 --> 0:9:0,56
its growth rate will still be high

282
0:9:0,56 --> 0:9:2,1
so what you're buying now

283
0:9:2,1 --> 0:9:4,3
will have grown significantly over the next two to three decades

284
0:9:4,3 --> 0:9:5,2
you can then sell it

285
0:9:5,2 --> 0:9:6,29
and buy something new

286
0:9:6,29 --> 0:9:7,73
it's a cycle like this

287
0:9:7,73 --> 0:9:8,65
as originally mentioned

288
0:9:8,65 --> 0:9:12,8
There's no stability when it comes to real estate.

289
0:9:12,8 --> 0:9:13,4
You should have listened to me back then

290
0:9:13,4 --> 0:9:15,24
Don't deplete all your funds.

291
0:9:15,24 --> 0:9:16,0
In this situation.

292
0:9:16,0 --> 0:9:16,94
That's correct.

293
0:9:16,94 --> 0:9:18,66
Because the market was declining over those two years.

294
0:9:18,66 --> 0:9:20,42
But it could be on the rise over the next two years.

295
0:9:20,42 --> 0:9:21,81
If you're considering now,

296
0:9:21,81 --> 0:9:23,69
You have between one to three million in funds.

297
0:9:23,69 --> 0:9:25,27
So how should you allocate it?

298
0:9:25,27 --> 0:9:26,93
I suggest you consider

299
0:9:26,93 --> 0:9:27,93
For example, Hangzhou and Suzhou

300
0:9:27,93 --> 0:9:29,2
In places like these

301
0:9:29,2 --> 0:9:30,98
You don’t necessarily have to buy in Beijing or Shanghai

302
0:9:30,98 --> 0:9:33,22
But many areas in Hangzhou and Suzhou are quite good

303
0:9:33,22 --> 0:9:34,94
Especially, I’m very bullish on Hangzhou

304
0:9:34,94 --> 0:9:37,52
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have gone all in on Hangzhou

305
0:9:37,52 --> 0:9:38,68
Of course

306
0:9:38,68 --> 0:9:40,78
If you're talking about the potential for growth,

307
0:9:40,78 --> 0:9:42,0
Chengdu,

308
0:9:42,0 --> 0:9:43,48
Changsha could also be a possibility,

309
0:9:43,48 --> 0:9:45,68
Changsha is currently the lowest among these cities,

310
0:9:45,68 --> 0:9:47,25
but looking to the future,

311
0:9:47,25 --> 0:9:49,25
it will be a competition for population,

312
0:9:49,25 --> 0:9:51,1
a competition for talent,

313
0:9:51,1 --> 0:9:52,25
across all regions,

314
0:9:52,25 --> 0:9:54,1
the number of emerging enterprises

315
0:9:54,1 --> 0:9:56,4
The growing number of college students

316
0:9:56,4 --> 0:9:57,74
The new positions being created

317
0:9:57,74 --> 0:9:59,82
The increasing number of emerging economies

318
0:9:59,82 --> 0:10:2,4
It's experiencing a surge in growth

319
0:10:2,4 --> 0:10:3,42
Looking to the future

320
0:10:3,42 --> 0:10:7,53
Since the population hasn't yet reached the point of decline

321
0:10:7,53 --> 0:10:8,99
Before reaching that turning point

322
0:10:8,99 --> 0:10:11,97
It will continue to see a large influx of people

323
0:10:11,97 --> 0:10:12,99
There will be employment challenges

324
0:10:12,99 --> 0:10:15,14
So, these things are always changing.

325
0:10:15,14 --> 0:10:17,22
Of course, this is just my opinion.

326
0:10:17,22 --> 0:10:20,38
Now, no one is really talking much about how future housing prices will go.

327
0:10:20,38 --> 0:10:22,96
But what I'm talking about is asset growth.

328
0:10:22,96 --> 0:10:28,279
Specifically, high-quality assets in top-tier economies of premier countries.

329
0:10:28,279 --> 0:10:29,959
Their prices will certainly rise.

330
0:10:29,959 --> 0:10:32,839
Because the current chaotic situation in the world,

331
0:10:32,839 --> 0:10:34,21
will only intensify,

332
0:10:34,21 --> 0:10:36,49
and the uncertainty of the future will continue to increase.

333
0:10:36,49 --> 0:10:38,33
So if you're international capital

334
0:10:38,33 --> 0:10:39,589
where do you put your money?

335
0:10:39,589 --> 0:10:41,749
Putting aside those prejudices,

336
0:10:41,749 --> 0:10:43,509
capital is incredibly smart.

337
0:10:43,509 --> 0:10:46,73
He doesn't really care much about ideology or such things.

338
0:10:46,73 --> 0:10:49,41
What it cares about is making a profit.

339
0:10:49,41 --> 0:10:50,31
It's about security.

340
0:10:50,31 --> 0:10:52,41
So where do you put this basket?

341
0:10:52,41 --> 0:10:55,69
So if you're bold enough,

342
0:10:55,69 --> 0:10:56,409
Jump on this opportunity

343
0:10:56,409 --> 0:10:57,549
and you'll be making a profit

344
0:10:57,549 --> 0:11:0,149
Of course, if you don't have much money to begin with

345
0:11:0,149 --> 0:11:1,69
then continue renting

346
0:11:1,69 --> 0:11:1,86
There's no problem with that

347
0:11:1,86 --> 0:11:3,14
If you only have one place to start with

348
0:11:3,14 --> 0:11:3,94
it's just one set

349
0:11:3,94 --> 0:11:4,9
then there's no issue

350
0:11:4,9 --> 0:11:6,78
you won't have much to worry about

351
0:11:6,78 --> 0:11:8,909
But if you belong to me

352
0:11:8,909 --> 0:11:9,549
Say it again

353
0:11:9,549 --> 0:11:11,349
In cities of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier

354
0:11:11,349 --> 0:11:14,189
Your parents left you a whopping 678 houses

355
0:11:14,189 --> 0:11:14,749
Two or three houses

356
0:11:14,749 --> 0:11:15,74
Four houses

357
0:11:15,74 --> 0:11:18,7
You have a bunch of ready-made Brahman houses in your hands.

358
0:11:18,7 --> 0:11:21,349
At this point, you feel that the house prices are dropping every day

359
0:11:21,349 --> 0:11:22,889
Now, if you don't act now

360
0:11:22,889 --> 0:11:24,629
If you don’t go and buy high-quality assets soon

361
0:11:24,629 --> 0:11:25,869
it might be too late

362
0:11:25,869 --> 0:11:26,709
no matter what you do

363
0:11:26,709 --> 0:11:27,589
Nepal needs to cross the river

364
0:11:27,589 --> 0:11:28,49
but it’s struggling to survive

365
0:11:28,49 --> 0:11:30,85
Many parents say they’ll wait and see if prices go up

366
0:11:30,85 --> 0:11:32,39
Let me tell you, prime locations

367
0:11:32,39 --> 0:11:33,95
in major cities will continue to rise

368
0:11:33,95 --> 0:11:37,79
but your remote areas won’t see any more growth

369
0:11:37,79 --> 0:11:39,94
So you don’t have to worry about a future comeback.

370
0:11:39,94 --> 0:11:42,5
If these parents are unwilling to cut their losses and leave now,

371
0:11:42,5 --> 0:11:43,8
the future will be tough for them.

372
0:11:43,8 --> 0:11:45,52
As the head of the household,

373
0:11:45,52 --> 0:11:46,56
you must understand this.

374
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:48,0
The decision you make now

375
0:11:48,0 --> 0:11:50,2
could mean a loss of a million or two in assets

376
0:11:50,2 --> 0:11:52,36
or a gain of a million or two in assets in the future.

377
0:11:52,36 --> 0:11:54,2
Of course, this difference might not be significant.

378
0:11:54,2 --> 0:11:57,23
Because most people are not active in this area

379
0:11:57,23 --> 0:11:58,87
Its liquidity isn't that strong

380
0:11:58,87 --> 0:12:0,91
So many people are not price-sensitive

381
0:12:0,91 --> 0:12:2,23
They feel that things are going well enough

382
0:12:2,23 --> 0:12:3,63
So let them continue living that way

383
0:12:3,63 --> 0:12:4,44
It's no problem

384
0:12:4,44 --> 0:12:6,38
You don't have to be like the majority

385
0:12:6,38 --> 0:12:9,6
You should be the one in your family who stays informed

386
0:12:9,6 --> 0:12:11,189
The one who is well-connected

387
0:12:11,189 --> 0:12:12,349
You should understand these things

388
0:12:12,349 --> 0:12:14,709
So when many people start talking about something

389
0:12:14,709 --> 0:12:16,15
It means it's a hot topic

390
0:12:16,15 --> 0:12:18,27
By the time you hear about this hot topic

391
0:12:18,27 --> 0:12:19,89
The timing has already passed

392
0:12:19,89 --> 0:12:22,1
When I talk about these things

393
0:12:22,1 --> 0:12:22,91
I'm talking about housing prices

394
0:12:22,91 --> 0:12:25,45
The time to avoid buying was in 2019

395
0:12:25,45 --> 0:12:26,54
2020

396
0:12:26,54 --> 0:12:27,82
Up until 2021

397
0:12:27,82 --> 0:12:28,46
2022

398
0:12:28,46 --> 0:12:29,38
I was still talking about those issues

399
0:12:29,38 --> 0:12:30,84
But by then it was already the result

400
0:12:30,84 --> 0:12:31,32
Right?

401
0:12:31,32 --> 0:12:32,92
But if you follow my early content

402
0:12:32,92 --> 0:12:34,52
You'll find that in 2018 and 2019

403
0:12:34,52 --> 0:12:36,0
2020, I was consistently discussing these issues

404
0:12:36,0 --> 0:12:37,12
Especially the issues with the golden real estate market

405
0:12:37,12 --> 0:12:38,66
I've mentioned many times

406
0:12:38,66 --> 0:12:41,54
Now, houses in Zhangjiakou Xiahua, near Beijing

407
0:12:41,54 --> 0:12:42,26
Back then

408
0:12:42,26 --> 0:12:43,7
I said you could rent a villa for 1900

409
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:44,28
Some people didn't believe me

410
0:12:44,28 --> 0:12:45,22
And accused me of lying

411
0:12:45,22 --> 0:12:46,24
What's the situation now?

412
0:12:46,24 --> 0:12:47,34
1500, 1300

413
0:12:47,34 --> 0:12:47,74
1200

414
0:12:47,74 --> 0:12:49,32
1100 can get you a villa

415
0:12:49,32 --> 0:12:50,18
Absolutely, you can rent a villa

416
0:12:50,18 --> 0:12:52,75
But check the current market prices first

417
0:12:52,75 --> 0:12:53,95
The real estate market is definitely trending downward

418
0:12:53,95 --> 0:12:56,99
So many people don't believe this trend in these areas

419
0:12:56,99 --> 0:12:57,59
These things

420
0:12:57,59 --> 0:13:0,73
Only those with foresight can see this

421
0:13:0,73 --> 0:13:2,41
If you don't believe me, check now

422
0:13:2,41 --> 0:13:4,97
You put my video away to watch it three years later.

423
0:13:4,97 --> 0:13:6,79
Will the prices have risen again?

424
0:13:6,79 --> 0:13:7,89
By then, it will be too late to jump in

425
0:13:7,89 --> 0:13:9,0
It will truly be too late
