0:0:0,48 --> 0:0:1,16
Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,16 --> 0:0:2,78
Welcome to another mattress chat

3
0:0:2,78 --> 0:0:5,8
This time, I'm filming from my new place

4
0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:6,92
But it's pretty late now

5
0:0:6,92 --> 0:0:9,39
It's already 12:30 AM

6
0:0:9,39 --> 0:0:12,35
So I didn't set up my lighting equipment

7
0:0:12,35 --> 0:0:13,71
My lights are plug-in

8
0:0:13,71 --> 0:0:15,13
They're the kind of high stand lights

9
0:0:15,13 --> 0:0:18,45
Actually, I used to use TIM from Film Storm

10
0:0:18,45 --> 0:0:19,25
Their lights

11
0:0:19,25 --> 0:0:20,33
Their lights are a bit more expensive

12
0:0:20,33 --> 0:0:22,4
Later, they switched to the Godox brand lights

13
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:24,52
The stand for his TIM lights

14
0:0:24,52 --> 0:0:29,1
Paired with the Godox light bulbs

15
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:30,69
So it's quite convenient to match them together

16
0:0:30,69 --> 0:0:33,739
The TIM lights can change to various colors

17
0:0:33,739 --> 0:0:35,179
And the stand is very suitable

18
0:0:35,179 --> 0:0:37,19
It's actually his lights

19
0:0:37,19 --> 0:0:39,539
This set of VLOG videos made me.

20
0:0:39,539 --> 0:0:42,47
Actually, at the beginning, I shot them lying on a mattress.

21
0:0:42,47 --> 0:0:43,73
How did those episodes turn out?

22
0:0:43,73 --> 0:0:46,14
Actually, they were pretty average because I was using natural light back then.

23
0:0:46,14 --> 0:0:47,9
Ever since I joined Bilibili, though,

24
0:0:47,9 --> 0:0:50,9
I got used to shooting my face with two lights.

25
0:0:50,9 --> 0:0:51,82
Moving on,

26
0:0:51,82 --> 0:0:53,2
using this lighting setup,

27
0:0:53,2 --> 0:0:54,87
plus cutting off all the indoor lights.

28
0:0:54,87 --> 0:0:58,43
Let's cut off all the indoor light sources used for daily life.

29
0:0:58,43 --> 0:1:1,22
Two powerful lights shine directly on my face.

30
0:1:1,22 --> 0:1:3,2
This creates the setting for my show.

31
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:4,36
Actually, speaking of it,

32
0:1:4,36 --> 0:1:6,86
the one who should be credited for starting this is TIM.

33
0:1:6,86 --> 0:1:8,8
Even though I'm just a little Calamity

34
0:1:8,8 --> 0:1:10,2
just an old man, chuckle,

35
0:1:10,2 --> 0:1:12,76
I truly appreciate the ecosystem of Bilibili,

36
0:1:12,76 --> 0:1:15,22
which sometimes can help many UPloaders.

37
0:1:15,22 --> 0:1:16,72
Achieving your life dreams

38
0:1:16,72 --> 0:1:20,7
You see, now I notice that even a little bit of light

39
0:1:20,7 --> 0:1:22,8
makes a big difference

40
0:1:22,8 --> 0:1:24,51
even if it’s just a bit on the face

41
0:1:24,51 --> 0:1:26,199
Look, the effect is much better this way

42
0:1:26,199 --> 0:1:27,599
In this approach

43
0:1:27,599 --> 0:1:30,319
We often find in our daily lives

44
0:1:30,319 --> 0:1:31,859
that you might unexpectedly

45
0:1:31,859 --> 0:1:33,729
find many skills coming together

46
0:1:33,729 --> 0:1:37,169
Many things that truly catch your attention

47
0:1:37,169 --> 0:1:39,129
are often the ones you initially didn't understand

48
0:1:39,129 --> 0:1:40,539
or were unaware of

49
0:1:40,539 --> 0:1:43,7
but many times, things are just like that

50
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:44,75
happening when you least expect them

51
0:1:44,75 --> 0:1:45,73
without you realizing it

52
0:1:45,73 --> 0:1:48,55
creating all sorts of novel conditions for you

53
0:1:48,55 --> 0:1:51,93
If I switch to that camera mode now

54
0:1:51,93 --> 0:1:53,43
the lighting will be more stable

55
0:1:53,43 --> 0:1:55,35
Actually, a little bit of light is enough.

56
0:1:55,35 --> 0:1:58,69
We mainly listen to the sound in my videos.

57
0:1:58,69 --> 0:2:0,65
But now there's a bit of an echo.

58
0:2:0,65 --> 0:2:1,37
So there's nothing we can do about it.

59
0:2:1,37 --> 0:2:3,25
Because this place is particularly empty right now.

60
0:2:3,25 --> 0:2:5,1
As everyone knows, in general,

61
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:8,52
my home in Beijing is piled high with stuff.

62
0:2:8,52 --> 0:2:9,72
So there's no echo there.

63
0:2:9,72 --> 0:2:11,16
But speaking of this new place,

64
0:2:11,16 --> 0:2:12,74
There will be a significant echo.

65
0:2:12,74 --> 0:2:14,849
Because the room isn't very large.

66
0:2:14,849 --> 0:2:15,669
It's quite empty.

67
0:2:15,669 --> 0:2:17,729
So it can't really be big and hollow, can it?

68
0:2:17,729 --> 0:2:19,429
But I have to record inside the room.

69
0:2:19,429 --> 0:2:21,41
The sound will be much quieter then.

70
0:2:21,73 --> 0:2:22,49
In any case,

71
0:2:22,49 --> 0:2:24,37
We've come this far.

72
0:2:24,37 --> 0:2:25,85
I was even talking about it with my partner.

73
0:2:25,85 --> 0:2:27,39
I said we'd start shooting this Friday.

74
0:2:27,39 --> 0:2:29,76
Then he expressed his concerns.

75
0:2:29,76 --> 0:2:31,24
What if the audience criticizes us?

76
0:2:31,24 --> 0:2:32,64
Because in the past, when he released his work,

77
0:2:32,64 --> 0:2:34,32
he often faced criticism from the audience.

78
0:2:34,32 --> 0:2:35,16
I told him not to worry.

79
0:2:35,16 --> 0:2:36,4
I won't let those malicious comments

80
0:2:36,4 --> 0:2:37,2
get to you.

81
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:38,28
I'll make sure to delete them all.

82
0:2:38,28 --> 0:2:39,379
It's okay.

83
0:2:39,379 --> 0:2:41,779
When anyone does something,

84
0:2:41,779 --> 0:2:43,59
there will be some resistance.

85
0:2:43,59 --> 0:2:44,3
It's very normal.

86
0:2:44,3 --> 0:2:45,96
For the topic of this episode,

87
0:2:45,96 --> 0:2:47,6
I'm holding my phone now,

88
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:48,54
I can check the theme of this episode.

89
0:2:48,54 --> 0:2:51,35
I want to see what my inspiration was all about.

90
0:2:51,35 --> 0:2:55,19
It's about why many cities ban motorcycles.

91
0:2:55,19 --> 0:2:57,59
Banning motorcycles is actually a significant logic.

92
0:2:57,59 --> 0:2:59,21
I want to tell everyone,

93
0:2:59,21 --> 0:3:1,3
encouraging people to learn how to ride motorcycles,

94
0:3:1,3 --> 0:3:2,919
to ride motorcycles,

95
0:3:2,919 --> 0:3:4,619
why do some cities ban motorcycles?

96
0:3:4,619 --> 0:3:8,6
it's because banning motorcycles can affect housing prices,

97
0:3:8,38 --> 0:3:10,2
not banning them would also impact housing prices,

98
0:3:10,2 --> 0:3:12,69
first, look at learning to ride,

99
0:3:12,69 --> 0:3:15,19
it usually costs between 4,000 to 6,000.

100
0:3:15,19 --> 0:3:18,11
Learning to ride a motorcycle costs around one thousand three hundred to one thousand six hundred.

101
0:3:18,11 --> 0:3:20,83
To put it simply, if you buy a motorcycle,

102
0:3:20,83 --> 0:3:22,55
it can cost from five thousand to tens of thousands of yuan,

103
0:3:22,55 --> 0:3:23,31
even over a hundred thousand yuan.

104
0:3:23,31 --> 0:3:25,13
But generally, it’s around a thousand yuan.

105
0:3:25,13 --> 0:3:26,94
But if you buy a car,

106
0:3:26,94 --> 0:3:28,84
even a car costing tens of thousands could be in bad shape,

107
0:3:28,84 --> 0:3:29,7
most cars cost over a hundred thousand yuan,

108
0:3:29,7 --> 0:3:30,2
or two hundred thousand yuan.

109
0:3:30,2 --> 0:3:30,58
over 300,000

110
0:3:30,58 --> 0:3:31,14
right?

111
0:3:31,14 --> 0:3:31,82
a bit much

112
0:3:31,82 --> 0:3:33,61
and then there are cars that cost over a million

113
0:3:33,61 --> 0:3:35,25
riding a motorcycle has one advantage

114
0:3:35,25 --> 0:3:37,1
you can weave through traffic, right?

115
0:3:37,1 --> 0:3:39,23
you're not affected by traffic jams

116
0:3:39,23 --> 0:3:41,48
so it's really more convenient

117
0:3:41,48 --> 0:3:43,46
there's no such thing as parking for motorcycles

118
0:3:43,46 --> 0:3:47,6
So you see, from buying a car, learning to drive, to parking, it all costs money.

119
0:3:47,6 --> 0:3:49,2
Parking fees and all that add up.

120
0:3:49,2 --> 0:3:51,8
But motorcycles are a tool for the masses.

121
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:54,41
They allow ordinary people to enjoy themselves.

122
0:3:54,41 --> 0:3:56,91
That's why many cities either ban motorcycles in the downtown area,

123
0:3:56,91 --> 0:3:58,61
or prohibit them throughout the entire city.

124
0:3:58,61 --> 0:4:0,28
However, in daily life,

125
0:4:0,28 --> 0:4:2,8
it's impossible to completely eliminate such vehicles.

126
0:4:2,8 --> 0:4:5,68
So they came up with these awkward electric scooters.

127
0:4:5,68 --> 0:4:8,29
Charging an electric bike is also relatively slow.

128
0:4:8,29 --> 0:4:9,0
Right?

129
0:4:9,0 --> 0:4:10,16
And its range is limited.

130
0:4:10,16 --> 0:4:11,92
But with a motorcycle, you have a motorcycle,

131
0:4:11,92 --> 0:4:14,36
you could even ride from Beijing all the way to Tibet.

132
0:4:14,36 --> 0:4:16,9
Ride all the way to Xinjiang without any issues.

133
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:17,17
You can complete a motorcycle trip.

134
0:4:17,17 --> 0:4:18,35
So, what’s the thing about this,

135
0:4:18,35 --> 0:4:20,57
what kind of risk does it pose?

136
0:4:20,57 --> 0:4:22,6
It's like iron wrapped in meat.

137
0:4:22,6 --> 0:4:23,36
But actually, this thing

138
0:4:23,36 --> 0:4:25,64
Every time the danger of motorcycles is promoted,

139
0:4:25,64 --> 0:4:27,99
various media will emphasize it heavily,

140
0:4:27,99 --> 0:4:28,99
how dangerous motorcycles are,

141
0:4:28,99 --> 0:4:30,55
look, all the motorcycle influencers have died.

142
0:4:30,55 --> 0:4:31,11
What can you do?

143
0:4:31,11 --> 0:4:32,19
But if you just drive slowly,

144
0:4:32,19 --> 0:4:35,3
riding a high-end scooter is fine.

145
0:4:35,3 --> 0:4:38,83
Why do I keep pointing out the various downsides of motorcycles?

146
0:4:38,83 --> 0:4:42,4
Because if you think about it, if you live in the suburbs,

147
0:4:42,4 --> 0:4:44,4
and you work in the city,

148
0:4:44,4 --> 0:4:46,44
riding a motorcycle is actually the fastest way to commute.

149
0:4:46,44 --> 0:4:47,78
It's even faster than the subway.

150
0:4:47,78 --> 0:4:49,46
Driving a car will get you stuck in traffic,

151
0:4:49,46 --> 0:4:53,27
and finding parking during the morning rush hour can be a real issue.

152
0:4:53,27 --> 0:4:55,47
So I've always recommended that people use motorcycles,

153
0:4:55,47 --> 0:4:56,95
especially in cities where they aren't banned.

154
0:4:56,95 --> 0:4:59,36
Or you could ride a motorcycle in from the suburbs

155
0:4:59,36 --> 0:4:59,84
Ride a motorcycle

156
0:4:59,84 --> 0:5:2,6
If there’s no way to avoid riding a motorcycle, we can’t really prohibit it

157
0:5:2,6 --> 0:5:4,58
Then you should try to use an electric scooter instead

158
0:5:4,58 --> 0:5:6,92
So riding an electric scooter is also convenient for parking

159
0:5:6,92 --> 0:5:8,62
And it’s not expensive, costing just a few thousand bucks

160
0:5:8,62 --> 0:5:9,32
Well

161
0:5:9,32 --> 0:5:11,0
So, in terms of status, it might be

162
0:5:11,0 --> 0:5:12,28
You might have a girlfriend

163
0:5:12,28 --> 0:5:14,71
Or carrying a family of three isn't exactly easy.

164
0:5:14,71 --> 0:5:16,53
But actually, the cost of owning a car,

165
0:5:16,53 --> 0:5:18,45
car loans and mortgages are similar,

166
0:5:18,45 --> 0:5:21,38
it helps to bridge the gap between urban and rural areas.

167
0:5:21,38 --> 0:5:24,1
So why are they willing to let you use it in rural areas,

168
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:25,74
but not in cities?

169
0:5:25,74 --> 0:5:27,9
Because it shortens the distance between them,

170
0:5:27,9 --> 0:5:31,22
which leads to more people developing the subway systems,

171
0:5:31,22 --> 0:5:34,82
and more people maintaining the automotive industry.

172
0:5:34,82 --> 0:5:38,1
Are you the person who collects parking fees at the parking lot?

173
0:5:38,1 --> 0:5:39,1
What else could they be doing?

174
0:5:39,1 --> 0:5:39,41
Right?

175
0:5:39,41 --> 0:5:40,57
So that's how it is.

176
0:5:40,57 --> 0:5:45,33
Why is the United States seen as a country on wheels?

177
0:5:45,33 --> 0:5:47,43
Why is it considered a country on wheels?

178
0:5:47,43 --> 0:5:49,95
It's because of its cities.

179
0:5:49,95 --> 0:5:51,3
Its transportation system.

180
0:5:51,3 --> 0:5:54,35
Its public transportation isn't particularly good.

181
0:5:54,35 --> 0:5:55,69
Public transportation isn't particularly good

182
0:5:55,69 --> 0:5:56,27
between cities

183
0:5:56,27 --> 0:5:57,37
and between states

184
0:5:57,37 --> 0:5:59,48
towns are also quite far apart

185
0:5:59,48 --> 0:6:1,3
so without a car

186
0:6:1,3 --> 0:6:2,82
it's absolutely not feasible in America

187
0:6:2,82 --> 0:6:5,6
even riding a motorcycle isn't convenient

188
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:8,31
because there are many places where the weather might not be great

189
0:6:8,31 --> 0:6:9,86
which could make motorcycle riding quite exhausting

190
0:6:9,86 --> 0:6:12,1
But when it comes to riding cars,

191
0:6:12,1 --> 0:6:13,94
We have to admit that cars have their advantages too.

192
0:6:13,94 --> 0:6:15,6
For instance, if you're in Xinjiang,

193
0:6:15,6 --> 0:6:16,56
or in Tibet,

194
0:6:16,56 --> 0:6:18,2
if you really think about it,

195
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:20,6
if you're crossing a remote area,

196
0:6:20,6 --> 0:6:22,6
you would definitely be much safer in a car.

197
0:6:22,6 --> 0:6:22,52
Right?

198
0:6:22,52 --> 0:6:24,7
A motorcycle could break down.

199
0:6:24,7 --> 0:6:25,3
To be honest

200
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:26,23
you don't have a tent with you

201
0:6:26,23 --> 0:6:27,59
and you lack the experience of motorcycle touring

202
0:6:27,59 --> 0:6:28,47
so you might have a tough time

203
0:6:28,47 --> 0:6:31,67
but I wouldn't go to such places for a road trip either

204
0:6:31,67 --> 0:6:34,31
and I would definitely ride to safe areas

205
0:6:34,31 --> 0:6:37,26
at most, maybe around Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai

206
0:6:37,26 --> 0:6:38,72
or a loop around Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan

207
0:6:38,72 --> 0:6:39,94
so to speak

208
0:6:39,94 --> 0:6:41,93
This effect has few limitations

209
0:6:41,93 --> 0:6:44,3
So I was talking about the motorcycle

210
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:46,9
Electric scooters are the joy of the less fortunate

211
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:47,49
Many people say to Teacher Rong

212
0:6:47,49 --> 0:6:48,61
You're just showing off

213
0:6:48,61 --> 0:6:49,45
You do this and that

214
0:6:49,45 --> 0:6:52,24
Then there are two kinds of criticism I get

215
0:6:52,24 --> 0:6:53,74
One is that I'm showing off

216
0:6:53,74 --> 0:6:55,26
And you have the money

217
0:6:55,26 --> 0:6:57,2
But then, I don't spend money.

218
0:6:57,2 --> 0:6:57,78
Pretending to be poor.

219
0:6:57,78 --> 0:6:58,94
How else can I put it?

220
0:6:58,94 --> 0:6:59,98
I mean, I'm poor.

221
0:6:59,98 --> 0:7:0,82
I am poor by nature.

222
0:7:0,82 --> 0:7:1,58
And then, pretending to be rich.

223
0:7:2,2 --> 0:7:3,96
Anyway, I get criticized for both.

224
0:7:3,96 --> 0:7:4,96
So, I'll take the middle ground.

225
0:7:4,96 --> 0:7:6,2
I guess I'll just be middle-class.

226
0:7:6,2 --> 0:7:7,16
The middle class is done for.

227
0:7:7,16 --> 0:7:7,84
Isn't that right?

228
0:7:7,84 --> 0:7:8,72
So, it's not too bad.

229
0:7:8,72 --> 0:7:10,34
But I don't work, so what about the middle class?

230
0:7:10,34 --> 0:7:12,7
What do you think? The poor are indeed poor.

231
0:7:12,7 --> 0:7:13,64
They don't even renovate their houses.

232
0:7:13,64 --> 0:7:14,35
Isn't that true?

233
0:7:14,35 --> 0:7:16,23
But the rich aren't that rich either, are they?

234
0:7:16,23 --> 0:7:16,59
Right?

235
0:7:16,59 --> 0:7:17,87
So, a lot of the time,

236
0:7:17,87 --> 0:7:19,6
he says no matter what,

237
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:20,76
others will always find a way to criticize you,

238
0:7:20,76 --> 0:7:22,64
but you must know the truth about their actions.

239
0:7:22,64 --> 0:7:25,86
The reason they criticize you is because they envy you.

240
0:7:25,86 --> 0:7:26,93
when someone looks at you,

241
0:7:26,93 --> 0:7:28,9
they feel quite surprised,

242
0:7:28,9 --> 0:7:29,31
they feel quite envious.

243
0:7:29,31 --> 0:7:30,9
That’s how it goes.

244
0:7:30,9 --> 0:7:32,97
You can't completely follow someone else's thoughts.

245
0:7:32,97 --> 0:7:35,559
But what they say is one thing,

246
0:7:35,559 --> 0:7:38,38
and what they think in reality is another.

247
0:7:38,38 --> 0:7:39,82
Those who criticize you,

248
0:7:39,82 --> 0:7:41,86
are usually not criticizing you specifically,

249
0:7:41,86 --> 0:7:45,64
but rather, they just enjoy the act of finding faults with you.

250
0:7:45,64 --> 0:7:47,16
That's how it is on the internet.

251
0:7:47,16 --> 0:7:48,66
So anyone can say anything.

252
0:7:48,66 --> 0:7:51,48
And they won't reveal their true thoughts no matter what.

253
0:7:51,48 --> 0:7:52,14
Let me tell you

254
0:7:52,14 --> 0:7:54,9
the honest truth is, it's all about jealousy and envy

255
0:7:54,9 --> 0:7:56,39
there's no reason for it

256
0:7:56,39 --> 0:7:56,599
you need to understand

257
0:7:56,599 --> 0:7:59,939
most people in this world tend to harbor ill will towards you

258
0:7:59,939 --> 0:8:1,679
a constant ill will

259
0:8:1,679 --> 0:8:3,87
it might be because you're a woman

260
0:8:3,87 --> 0:8:5,59
or because you're experiencing hair loss

261
0:8:5,59 --> 0:8:6,63
or simply because you're wealthy

262
0:8:6,63 --> 0:8:7,69
Or because you don't have money

263
0:8:7,69 --> 0:8:9,48
people look down on you, right?

264
0:8:9,48 --> 0:8:11,6
Why does the old lady from Xicheng look down on me?

265
0:8:11,6 --> 0:8:14,24
Because she thinks I'm pretending to be rich

266
0:8:14,24 --> 0:8:16,64
I come from a family that has been poor for three generations

267
0:8:16,64 --> 0:8:18,88
The reason someone looks down on me is because

268
0:8:18,88 --> 0:8:21,58
I pretend to win people's hearts

269
0:8:21,58 --> 0:8:23,28
I could easily get by without a luxury car

270
0:8:23,28 --> 0:8:24,86
but I can afford a Porsche

271
0:8:24,86 --> 0:8:26,4
We really have to go to number 9

272
0:8:26,4 --> 0:8:28,82
This is just putting on an act for us to see

273
0:8:28,82 --> 0:8:31,0
Sigh, so both of these mindsets are present

274
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:32,4
Actually, let's talk about this a bit more

275
0:8:32,4 --> 0:8:35,789
Now, this t talk and refuge in the United States

276
0:8:35,789 --> 0:8:37,589
Now, about posting on Xiaohongshu

277
0:8:37,589 --> 0:8:40,789
Originally, it's because of many things

278
0:8:40,789 --> 0:8:42,329
It's not something unheard of

279
0:8:42,329 --> 0:8:45,119
It's something widely enjoyed

280
0:8:45,119 --> 0:8:47,819
Because every country uses its own media

281
0:8:47,819 --> 0:8:50,72
to portray the other as being in a terrible state

282
0:8:50,72 --> 0:8:53,8
making the other country seem like a living hell

283
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:54,24
while things are quite good here

284
0:8:54,24 --> 0:8:56,2
But after the Chinese and American people face off

285
0:8:56,2 --> 0:8:59,7
they find that they can really appreciate each other's strengths

286
0:8:59,7 --> 0:9:0,12
Right?

287
0:9:0,12 --> 0:9:2,12
So many times I often say

288
0:9:2,12 --> 0:9:6,31
I have always maintained a cautious and serious attitude

289
0:9:6,31 --> 0:9:7,95
When it comes to the United States of America

290
0:9:7,95 --> 0:9:9,11
especially for the ordinary people

291
0:9:9,11 --> 0:9:11,5
there's no need to harbor such deep hostility

292
0:9:11,5 --> 0:9:12,65
In many cases

293
0:9:12,65 --> 0:9:15,41
the people of China and the United States are among the happier in the world

294
0:9:15,41 --> 0:9:17,41
because both countries are quite powerful

295
0:9:17,41 --> 0:9:19,25
we should be moving towards more cooperation

296
0:9:19,25 --> 0:9:20,77
rather than competition and division

297
0:9:20,77 --> 0:9:22,85
This is also one of our country's major policies

298
0:9:22,85 --> 0:9:24,52
Actually, we are willing to cooperate.

299
0:9:24,52 --> 0:9:25,72
We don’t want to engage in confrontation.

300
0:9:25,72 --> 0:9:27,19
Many things are like this.

301
0:9:27,19 --> 0:9:30,3
So I think if someone can move freely between China and the U.S.,

302
0:9:30,3 --> 0:9:32,67
it’s a truly blessed thing.

303
0:9:32,67 --> 0:9:34,68
It really is a very fortunate thing.

304
0:9:34,68 --> 0:9:36,9
The two most powerful countries in the world.

305
0:9:36,9 --> 0:9:38,44
This has always been my view.

306
0:9:38,44 --> 0:9:40,1
There’s no need for confrontation.

307
0:9:40,1 --> 0:9:41,56
There's no need to act as a reverie

308
0:9:41,56 --> 0:9:43,32
Wherever you are, there's always bickering

309
0:9:43,32 --> 0:9:45,6
While in China, think about the good things in China

310
0:9:45,6 --> 0:9:47,76
When in America, think about the good things in America, and that's just fine

311
0:9:47,76 --> 0:9:50,58
Then, this artificial wall will certainly be built up

312
0:9:50,58 --> 0:9:51,56
Sooner or later

313
0:9:51,56 --> 0:9:54,72
User data between China and the U.S. will still remain invisible to each other

314
0:9:54,72 --> 0:9:57,36
But it's like the Christmas truce during World War I

315
0:9:57,36 --> 0:9:58,64
It's a brief peace

316
0:9:58,64 --> 0:10:0,62
Let everyone be able to enjoy

317
0:10:0,62 --> 0:10:4,3
Being able to enjoy this brief peace is good enough

318
0:10:4,3 --> 0:10:5,82
I think in this world

319
0:10:5,82 --> 0:10:7,66
There might not be true understanding and peace

320
0:10:7,66 --> 0:10:10,56
But remember this short period of time

321
0:10:10,56 --> 0:10:12,94
All the events that happen in this human world

322
0:10:12,94 --> 0:10:14,17
Don't have a

323
0:10:14,17 --> 0:10:15,23
One could say

324
0:10:15,23 --> 0:10:18,99
Actually, they all follow a certain logic

325
0:10:18,99 --> 0:10:21,39
No matter what happens in this world

326
0:10:21,39 --> 0:10:24,1
There's nothing new under the sun

327
0:10:24,1 --> 0:10:26,39
So often, what's separated will eventually come together

328
0:10:26,39 --> 0:10:27,3
And what's together will eventually split apart

329
0:10:27,3 --> 0:10:29,4
You see it every day in the media

330
0:10:29,4 --> 0:10:30,4
American media criticizing China

331
0:10:30,4 --> 0:10:32,52
Chinese media criticizing America, it's just a bunch of

332
0:10:32,52 --> 0:10:34,92
So-called redneck patriotic bloggers

333
0:10:34,92 --> 0:10:35,96
It's just outrageous

334
0:10:35,96 --> 0:10:37,56
It’s like they’re more anxious than the official side all day long

335
0:10:37,56 --> 0:10:39,66
Every day they’re issuing challenges through the internet

336
0:10:39,66 --> 0:10:41,26
This kind of behavior is really scary

337
0:10:41,26 --> 0:10:43,18
Actually, I used to have a big presence on Weibo too

338
0:10:43,18 --> 0:10:44,54
It’s this kind of image

339
0:10:44,54 --> 0:10:46,65
Because on Weibo, everything is so clearly divided

340
0:10:46,65 --> 0:10:47,77
You have to form cliques

341
0:10:47,77 --> 0:10:49,43
Then you have to create factions, that’s how it goes

342
0:10:49,43 --> 0:10:50,73
So no matter what

343
0:10:50,73 --> 0:10:52,27
It's just a state of mutual insults

344
0:10:52,27 --> 0:10:53,29
So it's quite boring

345
0:10:53,29 --> 0:10:56,91
You'll find that in life, people can actually foster cooperation

346
0:10:56,91 --> 0:10:58,66
And become friends more often

347
0:10:58,66 --> 0:11:1,6
So many people who really watch the content

348
0:11:1,6 --> 0:11:2,58
If they don't make judgments

349
0:11:2,58 --> 0:11:3,68
To be honest

350
0:11:3,68 --> 0:11:5,6
It's better to absorb the useful parts for yourself

351
0:11:5,6 --> 0:11:6,54
You can distance yourself from it

352
0:11:6,54 --> 0:11:7,74
Just one curse and they're gone

353
0:11:7,74 --> 0:11:9,56
Actually, it doesn't do you any good in life

354
0:11:9,56 --> 0:11:12,5
For me, it's a matter of indifference

355
0:11:12,5 --> 0:11:13,21
You're not my audience

356
0:11:13,21 --> 0:11:14,17
You're not my follower

357
0:11:14,17 --> 0:11:17,319
Whether you like me or not doesn't matter to me

358
0:11:17,319 --> 0:11:18,559
Many people leave long comments

359
0:11:18,559 --> 0:11:20,259
What they say can be quite insightful

360
0:11:20,259 --> 0:11:22,679
But if they don't follow, it doesn't matter

361
0:11:22,679 --> 0:11:23,399
It doesn’t matter.

362
0:11:23,399 --> 0:11:24,79
So, coming to the point,

363
0:11:24,79 --> 0:11:26,45
you mean you’re not my target audience, right?

364
0:11:26,45 --> 0:11:27,57
I won’t cater to,

365
0:11:27,57 --> 0:11:30,77
let alone change my views to match yours.

366
0:11:30,77 --> 0:11:31,83
And in life,

367
0:11:31,83 --> 0:11:33,59
to be honest, there are so many channels,

368
0:11:33,59 --> 0:11:34,97
you can watch whatever you want.

369
0:11:34,97 --> 0:11:36,55
Today we talked about the issue of motorcycle bans.

370
0:11:36,55 --> 0:11:38,55
We also talked about the issue of ordinary people in China and the U.S. keeping accounts.

371
0:11:38,55 --> 0:11:40,3
So, many things in this world,

372
0:11:40,3 --> 0:11:42,22
involve breaking through a cognitive illusion,

373
0:11:42,22 --> 0:11:44,44
and overcoming another limitation on this issue.

374
0:11:44,44 --> 0:11:49,9
What makes me happiest isn't how those who criticize me view me,

375
0:11:49,9 --> 0:11:52,37
but what my followers think of me.

376
0:11:52,37 --> 0:11:55,57
Many of my followers and how they perceive me,

377
0:11:55,57 --> 0:11:56,81
that's what truly matters.

378
0:11:56,81 --> 0:11:58,29
And it's not just about how they see me.

379
0:11:58,29 --> 0:12:1,8
It was me who played a real role in their lives

380
0:12:1,8 --> 0:12:6,37
And that real role is to alleviate psychological stress

381
0:12:6,37 --> 0:12:7,59
Most of the time

382
0:12:7,59 --> 0:12:8,83
I break down the issues

383
0:12:8,83 --> 0:12:9,27
I dissect them thoroughly

384
0:12:9,27 --> 0:12:11,8
I talk at length about them

385
0:12:11,8 --> 0:12:14,92
In practice, this actually reduces people's anxiety levels

386
0:12:14,92 --> 0:12:17,24
And I explain some of these issues

387
0:12:17,24 --> 0:12:19,26
I delve into the specifics and clarify them

388
0:12:19,26 --> 0:12:20,74
To put it bluntly, afterwards

389
0:12:20,74 --> 0:12:22,94
it actually dispels that feeling

390
0:12:22,94 --> 0:12:24,14
why are you anxious

391
0:12:24,14 --> 0:12:24,77
right

392
0:12:24,77 --> 0:12:26,85
are you anxious about your house or your car

393
0:12:26,85 --> 0:12:27,93
or are you anxious about your partner

394
0:12:27,93 --> 0:12:29,29
or about the future

395
0:12:29,29 --> 0:12:30,51
none of these are necessary

396
0:12:30,51 --> 0:12:31,91
so in this regard

397
0:12:31,91 --> 0:12:35,5
Since a 40-year-old has just gone through these pitfalls

398
0:12:35,5 --> 0:12:37,11
and is here to share these insights with you

399
0:12:37,11 --> 0:12:40,24
it might truly be a fitting state

400
0:12:40,24 --> 0:12:43,2
so this is naturally where I should be

401
0:12:43,2 --> 0:12:45,25
this is the place I should be in

402
0:12:45,25 --> 0:12:47,37
this is also what I believe

403
0:12:47,37 --> 0:12:50,81
is about playing my part effectively

404
0:12:50,81 --> 0:12:52,3
whether I win the BILIBILI UP100 or not

405
0:12:52,3 --> 0:12:54,66
whether I have 1 million or 2 million followers

406
0:12:54,66 --> 0:12:55,82
Can I pick up Guangzi?

407
0:12:55,82 --> 0:12:56,94
These things are not important.

408
0:12:56,94 --> 0:12:58,46
What's important is that I can serve my current audience.

409
0:12:58,46 --> 0:13:0,1
I am unique to my audience.

410
0:13:0,1 --> 0:13:2,71
So these things are knowledge.

411
0:13:2,71 --> 0:13:4,55
A key reason for me to move forward.

412
0:13:4,55 --> 0:13:7,28
Is that a large part of the people are strangers to you.

413
0:13:7,28 --> 0:13:10,2
Some of them are just spectators.

414
0:13:10,2 --> 0:13:11,94
Some people are just spectators

415
0:13:11,94 --> 0:13:14,26
But there are people who truly appreciate you

416
0:13:14,26 --> 0:13:15,4
They are the ones who love you

417
0:13:15,4 --> 0:13:17,91
These are your core followers

418
0:13:17,91 --> 0:13:21,27
These people are the most important, like at my recent fan meet-up

419
0:13:21,27 --> 0:13:22,9
I felt so great

420
0:13:22,9 --> 0:13:24,98
Because there were about 30 people

421
0:13:24,98 --> 0:13:26,24
Almost 40 people

422
0:13:26,24 --> 0:13:31,36
These children especially came from far away

423
0:13:31,36 --> 0:13:33,24
Just to catch a glimpse of this old man

424
0:13:33,24 --> 0:13:34,84
In the course of life,

425
0:13:34,84 --> 0:13:38,49
I tell you, doing tough things will always pay off.

426
0:13:38,49 --> 0:13:39,79
So, doing such things,

427
0:13:39,79 --> 0:13:43,17
feels like it really makes a difference in people's lives.

428
0:13:43,17 --> 0:13:44,55
It really had an impact.

429
0:13:44,55 --> 0:13:46,12
People brought me gifts,

430
0:13:46,12 --> 0:13:47,4
came to see me,

431
0:13:47,4 --> 0:13:48,56
spent money on me,

432
0:13:48,56 --> 0:13:49,98
cheered for me.

433
0:13:49,98 --> 0:13:54,6
These things, for me personally,

434
0:13:54,6 --> 0:13:56,14
are a tremendous encouragement.

435
0:13:56,14 --> 0:13:59,92
Because I am actually divorced,

436
0:13:59,92 --> 0:14:2,94
a man full of energy but with no place to channel it,

437
0:14:2,94 --> 0:14:4,69
an old man,

438
0:14:4,69 --> 0:14:6,329
but thankfully, people have stuck by me,

439
0:14:6,329 --> 0:14:7,669
listened to my ramblings,

440
0:14:7,669 --> 0:14:9,79
endured my endless talk,

441
0:14:9,79 --> 0:14:13,11
and even found my twisted logic useful.

442
0:14:13,11 --> 0:14:14,81
And that's what makes me feel accomplished,

443
0:14:14,81 --> 0:14:17,47
and in turn, I've helped others.

444
0:14:17,47 --> 0:14:18,81
It's a mutual relationship,

445
0:14:18,81 --> 0:14:20,35
and that's the best feeling,

446
0:14:20,35 --> 0:14:21,75
not about how many people like you.

447
0:14:21,75 --> 0:14:23,63
In life, many things can be said,

448
0:14:23,63 --> 0:14:26,23
you might not be the flashy motorcycle,

449
0:14:26,23 --> 0:14:30,26
you are the motorcycle,

450
0:14:30,26 --> 0:14:31,9
you might not be as shiny and sleek as a car,

451
0:14:31,9 --> 0:14:34,42
able to dominate the main roads,

452
0:14:34,42 --> 0:14:35,8
or fetch a high price, right?

453
0:14:35,8 --> 0:14:38,31
You might just be a motorcycle,

454
0:14:38,31 --> 0:14:39,71
not even an expensive BMW motorcycle,

455
0:14:39,71 --> 0:14:42,27
not the kind that can socialize with bikers,

456
0:14:42,27 --> 0:14:43,35
you might just be a regular scooter,

457
0:14:43,35 --> 0:14:47,11
with a big frame,

458
0:14:47,11 --> 0:14:51,339
right?

459
0:14:51,339 --> 0:14:52,719
But you solve the need for urban commuting,

460
0:14:52,719 --> 0:14:53,339
you meet the most important needs of an ordinary person's life,

461
0:14:53,339 --> 0:14:55,419
you might not be as flashy,

462
0:14:55,419 --> 0:14:58,19
but being practical is enough.

463
0:14:58,19 --> 0:14:59,859
In many aspects of our lives,

464
0:14:59,859 --> 0:15:2,44
that's where the value lies,

465
0:15:2,44 --> 0:15:3,72
not in competing with handsome guys,

466
0:15:3,72 --> 0:15:4,92
not in competing with beautiful women,

467
0:15:4,92 --> 0:15:7,48
but in having your own place,

468
0:15:7,48 --> 0:15:9,78
having a position in the hearts of ordinary people,

469
0:15:9,78 --> 0:15:11,6
being able to help many people commute,

470
0:15:11,6 --> 0:15:13,72
that's your role.

471
0:15:13,72 --> 0:15:16,47
So, Brother Rong is that little motorcycle in your life.

472
0:15:16,47 --> 0:15:17,71
This is your role.

473
0:15:17,71 --> 0:15:21,82
So, Brother Rong is that little motorcycle in your life.
