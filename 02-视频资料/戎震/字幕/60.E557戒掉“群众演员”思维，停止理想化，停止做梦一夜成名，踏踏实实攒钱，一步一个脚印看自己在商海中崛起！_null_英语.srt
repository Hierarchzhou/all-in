1
0:0:0,68 --> 0:0:3,64
I used to be a performance teacher.

2
0:0:3,64 --> 0:0:6,18
I've told my students something.

3
0:0:6,18 --> 0:0:9,22
Never be an extra.

4
0:0:9,22 --> 0:0:10,62
Don’t be a supporting actor either.

5
0:0:10,62 --> 0:0:13,59
But most importantly, never be an extra.

6
0:0:13,59 --> 0:0:14,639
Many people say,

7
0:0:14,639 --> 0:0:15,819
You don’t have experience,

8
0:0:15,819 --> 0:0:17,299
Don’t you have to start from the bottom?

9
0:0:17,299 --> 0:0:18,919
Why can’t you be an extra?

10
0:0:18,919 --> 0:0:20,799
Don’t look down on any dream.

11
0:0:20,799 --> 0:0:22,11
Let me tell you,

12
0:0:22,11 --> 0:0:25,46
there are shortcuts in life’s journey.

13
0:0:25,46 --> 0:0:27,82
If you don’t know where these shortcuts are,

14
0:0:27,82 --> 0:0:29,52
it’s best not to take that path.

15
0:0:29,52 --> 0:0:31,55
Many things have shortcuts.

16
0:0:31,55 --> 0:0:33,11
You might be putting in effort,

17
0:0:33,11 --> 0:0:34,97
but you’re only impressing yourself.

18
0:0:34,97 --> 0:0:39,59
Just look at the recent news, all sorts of stories about how job opportunities are decreasing.

19
0:0:39,59 --> 0:0:41,379
Actor XXX has started delivering food.

20
0:0:41,379 --> 0:0:42,179
How things have turned out.

21
0:0:42,179 --> 0:0:44,479
Actor XXX has started driving for a ride-hailing service.

22
0:0:44,479 --> 0:0:45,49
Borrowing money from friends.

23
0:0:45,49 --> 0:0:47,29
And I didn’t really want to be an internet celebrity.

24
0:0:47,29 --> 0:0:50,11
I’m begging everyone to give me a chance.

25
0:0:50,11 --> 0:0:52,19
But the truth is, I still want to act.

26
0:0:52,19 --> 0:0:54,21
Or maybe it’s because there aren’t as many long series nowadays.

27
0:0:54,21 --> 0:0:55,73
Now I’m working as an actor in short series.

28
0:0:55,73 --> 0:0:57,19
Short drama actors really have it tough

29
0:0:57,19 --> 0:0:58,51
Making money is so hard

30
0:0:58,51 --> 0:0:59,91
Let me tell you

31
0:0:59,91 --> 0:1:3,24
It's what I've been telling everyone

32
0:1:3,24 --> 0:1:5,96
Don't have this idea

33
0:1:5,96 --> 0:1:10,51
One day, everyone will see the plays I act in

34
0:1:10,51 --> 0:1:12,15
And then I'll become a star

35
0:1:12,15 --> 0:1:13,53
I'll earn more money

36
0:1:13,53 --> 0:1:17,59
That's the fantasy of the emperor plowing the field with a golden hoe

37
0:1:17,59 --> 0:1:22,49
Many extras, to be honest, are kind of

38
0:1:22,49 --> 0:1:24,65
people with dreams

39
0:1:24,65 --> 0:1:26,57
I can't say they're not focused on their main careers

40
0:1:26,57 --> 0:1:28,11
they are very serious

41
0:1:28,11 --> 0:1:30,359
about being extras

42
0:1:30,359 --> 0:1:32,279
always wanting to add a few more lines when they can

43
0:1:32,279 --> 0:1:34,3
hoping for a chance to fulfill their dreams

44
0:1:34,3 --> 0:1:36,26
but let me tell you

45
0:1:36,26 --> 0:1:38,74
most people in their lives

46
0:1:38,74 --> 0:1:42,25
The mistakes you're making are the same as these extras.

47
0:1:42,25 --> 0:1:48,289
It's impossible to get rich or famous by doing a regular job.

48
0:1:48,289 --> 0:1:51,969
First, let's talk about how the entertainment industry is extremely pretentious,

49
0:1:51,969 --> 0:1:53,609
extremely conservative.

50
0:1:53,609 --> 0:1:58,89
You'll find that most popular actors nowadays are second-generation stars,

51
0:1:58,89 --> 0:2:0,9
or rich kids,

52
0:2:1,46 --> 0:2:5,63
or a large number of them are children of mistresses.

53
0:2:5,63 --> 0:2:7,59
Why children of mistresses?

54
0:2:7,59 --> 0:2:10,4
Because the big shots don't want to show their faces.

55
0:2:10,4 --> 0:2:11,92
Because he's not the legitimate eldest son

56
0:2:11,92 --> 0:2:12,88
not the legitimate eldest daughter

57
0:2:12,88 --> 0:2:14,96
she doesn't have the right to inherit the family business

58
0:2:14,96 --> 0:2:19,26
the best option for her is either to go to Vancouver and have Rong help her with her homework

59
0:2:19,26 --> 0:2:21,6
or to enter the entertainment industry

60
0:2:21,6 --> 0:2:23,93
because with a lower score, she can still get into university

61
0:2:23,93 --> 0:2:26,39
this is the best way to inherit the family business

62
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:29,59
turning wealth and power into fame

63
0:2:29,59 --> 0:2:34,17
so those wealthy actors often set up production teams for filming

64
0:2:34,17 --> 0:2:36,279
Get some veteran actors to play alongside him

65
0:2:36,279 --> 0:2:38,99
Once they become popular

66
0:2:38,99 --> 0:2:41,759
These people come from wealthy families

67
0:2:41,759 --> 0:2:44,78
You, through wanting to learn acting

68
0:2:44,78 --> 0:2:47,67
And then by working as an extra in the future

69
0:2:47,67 --> 0:2:52,35
Or by taking on minor roles to enter today's entertainment industry

70
0:2:52,35 --> 0:2:54,59
With so many fan circles around

71
0:2:56,19 --> 0:2:59,96
If you want to go against the grain in this situation

72
0:2:59,96 --> 0:3:2,1
It's virtually impossible to become famous

73
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:3,42
Unless you're looking for trouble

74
0:3:3,42 --> 0:3:4,68
Or you're exceptionally smart

75
0:3:4,68 --> 0:3:6,44
As smart as Liying Zhao

76
0:3:6,44 --> 0:3:8,44
Or as tough and capable as Baoqiang Wang

77
0:3:8,44 --> 0:3:9,3
Then you might stand a chance

78
0:3:9,3 --> 0:3:11,1
But apart from those two

79
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:12,56
Can you give me a third example

80
0:3:12,56 --> 0:3:14,95
Tell me, how many graduates

81
0:3:14,95 --> 0:3:16,29
From the Central Academy of Drama, Beijing Film Academy, and Shanghai Theatre Academy each year

82
0:3:16,29 --> 0:3:17,87
The Military Art and Media University

83
0:3:17,87 --> 0:3:19,11
Nanjing Arts and Zhejiang Media

84
0:3:19,11 --> 0:3:21,64
Let's calculate how many graduates we have

85
0:3:21,64 --> 0:3:25,72
Over the years, how many graduates each year are more attractive than you

86
0:3:25,72 --> 0:3:27,44
In the end, didn't they all end up at KTVs

87
0:3:27,44 --> 0:3:28,4
Or at business KTVs

88
0:3:28,4 --> 0:3:29,899
Or as streamers

89
0:3:29,899 --> 0:3:32,439
How many of my students are now out of acting jobs?

90
0:3:32,439 --> 0:3:33,839
Still doing streaming

91
0:3:33,839 --> 0:3:34,419
Is that right?

92
0:3:34,419 --> 0:3:35,579
Of course, there are those who get roles.

93
0:3:35,579 --> 0:3:37,99
But for those who do get roles,

94
0:3:37,99 --> 0:3:40,23
I'm asking you, what's their family like now?

95
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:41,33
What was it like before?

96
0:3:41,33 --> 0:3:43,14
And what is it like now?

97
0:3:43,42 --> 0:3:48,64
It's impossible for them to achieve social mobility through the entertainment industry and the money they earn,

98
0:3:48,64 --> 0:3:52,85
In other words, they might make a few hundred thousand a year, but that's as far as it goes.

99
0:3:52,85 --> 0:3:53,77
Of course.

100
0:3:53,77 --> 0:3:54,77
The teacher has a few hundred thousand

101
0:3:54,77 --> 0:3:55,33
What's not to like about that?

102
0:3:55,33 --> 0:3:58,149
But you need to understand the price he has to pay for that money

103
0:3:58,149 --> 0:4:0,89
He has to constantly entertain

104
0:4:0,89 --> 0:4:0,929
Dine out with guests

105
0:4:0,929 --> 0:4:2,9
It's incredibly complicated

106
0:4:2,9 --> 0:4:4,97
Maintaining those few friendships is already tough

107
0:4:4,97 --> 0:4:6,93
And in the entertainment industry

108
0:4:6,93 --> 0:4:7,65
There's no social security

109
0:4:7,65 --> 0:4:8,45
There's no invoice

110
0:4:8,45 --> 0:4:9,9
No contract

111
0:4:9,9 --> 0:4:11,88
A lot of things are essentially fly-by-night operations

112
0:4:11,88 --> 0:4:13,44
All sorts of completely

113
0:4:13,44 --> 0:4:14,72
In reality, you're making money for others

114
0:4:14,72 --> 0:4:15,56
For the assistant director

115
0:4:15,56 --> 0:4:16,74
For the producer

116
0:4:16,74 --> 0:4:18,38
You're not making money for yourself at all

117
0:4:18,38 --> 0:4:19,72
You're just earning this small amount

118
0:4:19,72 --> 0:4:21,43
you have to grovel to others

119
0:4:21,43 --> 0:4:23,65
so this is just not normal

120
0:4:23,65 --> 0:4:24,47
so in China

121
0:4:24,47 --> 0:4:25,63
if you want to do this

122
0:4:25,63 --> 0:4:26,67
if you want to put it this way

123
0:4:26,67 --> 0:4:28,33
unless you're one of those who take shortcuts

124
0:4:28,33 --> 0:4:32,11
those who dare to take the risk of breaking the law

125
0:4:32,11 --> 0:4:33,55
these people can make money

126
0:4:33,55 --> 0:4:35,94
but they're actually committing embezzlement

127
0:4:35,94 --> 0:4:36,5
Of course, let's talk about it.

128
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:38,84
There are also some operators involved in money laundering.

129
0:4:38,84 --> 0:4:40,1
They can make money.

130
0:4:40,1 --> 0:4:42,94
The rest are idealists with dreams.

131
0:4:42,94 --> 0:4:44,33
They barely earn anything.

132
0:4:44,33 --> 0:4:46,45
So you need to understand one thing.

133
0:4:46,45 --> 0:4:49,75
You might get a few more lines on set.

134
0:4:49,75 --> 0:4:51,46
You might show a bit more skin.

135
0:4:51,46 --> 0:4:55,3
But it’s highly unlikely that this will lead to a class leap for you.

136
0:4:55,3 --> 0:4:58,62
The actors you see now make a lot of money from endorsements.

137
0:4:58,62 --> 0:5:0,61
They earn a lot from variety shows too.

138
0:5:0,61 --> 0:5:2,79
And making a film can also bring in a lot of cash.

139
0:5:2,79 --> 0:5:5,76
Those people are already wealthy.

140
0:5:5,76 --> 0:5:9,82
It’s easy for a rich person to get even richer.

141
0:5:9,82 --> 0:5:11,48
But a person at the bottom

142
0:5:11,48 --> 0:5:12,22
or in the middle,

143
0:5:12,22 --> 0:5:14,39
it’s really hard to climb up.

144
0:5:14,39 --> 0:5:19,13
It’s best not to have the idea that you can move up by doing ordinary jobs.

145
0:5:19,13 --> 0:5:22,51
The best way to climb up is to go into business.

146
0:5:22,51 --> 0:5:24,37
Doing business is a viable option.

147
0:5:24,37 --> 0:5:25,83
The scope of business is broad.

148
0:5:25,83 --> 0:5:27,55
You could be an investor.

149
0:5:27,55 --> 0:5:29,7
You could be an entrepreneur.

150
0:5:29,7 --> 0:5:30,29
You could be a sole proprietor.

151
0:5:30,29 --> 0:5:31,83
All these options are feasible.

152
0:5:31,83 --> 0:5:34,55
If you think you can make money just by your looks,

153
0:5:34,55 --> 0:5:36,44
you'd better go into business instead.

154
0:5:36,44 --> 0:5:38,26
You'd be better off being a streamer

155
0:5:38,26 --> 0:5:40,46
Or even a social media influencer; the money comes in faster

156
0:5:40,46 --> 0:5:41,64
Let's be honest

157
0:5:41,64 --> 0:5:44,35
There are still people with this kind of mentality, waiting for opportunities to fall into their lap

158
0:5:44,35 --> 0:5:46,23
And your so-called connections

159
0:5:46,23 --> 0:5:47,39
Today you meet an assistant director

160
0:5:47,39 --> 0:5:48,41
Tomorrow you meet a cameraman

161
0:5:48,41 --> 0:5:50,47
The day after tomorrow, a producer

162
0:5:50,47 --> 0:5:52,63
They'll just end up spinning you around and taking advantage of you

163
0:5:52,63 --> 0:5:54,27
I wouldn’t let you sleep soundly if I didn’t want you to.

164
0:5:54,27 --> 0:5:56,7
They wouldn’t let you out otherwise.

165
0:5:56,7 --> 0:5:59,169
And they have a ton of resources.

166
0:5:59,169 --> 0:6:1,89
I’m just a small-time director, you know.

167
0:6:1,89 --> 0:6:2,89
I’ve only directed a couple of plays.

168
0:6:2,89 --> 0:6:5,13
Even with a web movie, there are so many people who come to me for no reason.

169
0:6:5,13 --> 0:6:6,45
It’s really frustrating.

170
0:6:6,45 --> 0:6:7,37
When it comes to filming,

171
0:6:7,37 --> 0:6:8,17
who do you think I’ll choose?

172
0:6:8,17 --> 0:6:9,53
I’d definitely go for the cheaper one

173
0:6:9,53 --> 0:6:10,91
Absolutely

174
0:6:10,91 --> 0:6:12,19
The ones who are close to me

175
0:6:12,19 --> 0:6:13,15
I’d definitely choose

176
0:6:13,15 --> 0:6:14,71
The young people I know now

177
0:6:14,71 --> 0:6:16,63
I wouldn’t pick someone who’s from Kashgar

178
0:6:16,63 --> 0:6:17,83
And they’re all in their thirties

179
0:6:17,83 --> 0:6:19,36
And they’re past their prime

180
0:6:19,36 --> 0:6:20,48
Then they ask you to act in a movie

181
0:6:20,48 --> 0:6:21,48
I should give you a few thousand dollars?

182
0:6:21,48 --> 0:6:22,12
Is that really necessary?

183
0:6:22,12 --> 0:6:24,159
Why wouldn't I use newly graduated college students?

184
0:6:24,159 --> 0:6:25,319
It can be settled with just a few thousand dollars.

185
0:6:25,319 --> 0:6:26,359
Why not?

186
0:6:26,359 --> 0:6:27,879
So in many cases,

187
0:6:27,879 --> 0:6:29,899
Don't think that just because you've studied acting,

188
0:6:29,899 --> 0:6:32,199
Or that you've made achievements in this field,

189
0:6:32,199 --> 0:6:34,67
You have acting skills and you'd be making the same mistake I did back then.

190
0:6:34,67 --> 0:6:36,43
I just didn't get it back then

191
0:6:36,43 --> 0:6:39,6
But I figured it out pretty quickly later on

192
0:6:39,6 --> 0:6:42,97
So in the end, it's better to stick to your own path

193
0:6:42,97 --> 0:6:45,41
You can try being an actor and drifting in Beijing

194
0:6:45,41 --> 0:6:45,85
Sure, why not

195
0:6:45,85 --> 0:6:47,49
Earning a few thousand a month is decent

196
0:6:47,49 --> 0:6:48,61
Living that kind of life

197
0:6:48,61 --> 0:6:50,35
Spending some time in Hengdian

198
0:6:50,35 --> 0:6:51,61
Or staying in Xiangshan

199
0:6:51,61 --> 0:6:53,5
Go and hang out on the left side.

200
0:6:53,5 --> 0:6:55,52
Visit Universal Studios.

201
0:6:55,52 --> 0:6:56,84
Or the Starlight area.

202
0:6:56,84 --> 0:6:58,4
You can spend some time there as well.

203
0:6:58,4 --> 0:6:59,32
It's all good.

204
0:6:59,32 --> 0:7:1,3
Go and experience this lifestyle.

205
0:7:1,3 --> 0:7:3,38
You see, I used to be an actor too.

206
0:7:3,38 --> 0:7:5,639
Being an actor gives you a feel for this life.

207
0:7:5,639 --> 0:7:7,19
And then you can become a performance teacher.

208
0:7:7,19 --> 0:7:8,559
Go ahead and write a book about acting

209
0:7:8,559 --> 0:7:9,739
Go ahead and pursue a master’s degree in acting

210
0:7:9,739 --> 0:7:10,46
Sure, you can do that

211
0:7:10,46 --> 0:7:11,62
Consider it as a way to experience life

212
0:7:11,62 --> 0:7:12,62
But if you want to make money

213
0:7:12,62 --> 0:7:14,2
If you want to change your social status

214
0:7:14,2 --> 0:7:17,4
It’s better not to waste your youth here

215
0:7:17,4 --> 0:7:18,54
Many people just don’t understand

216
0:7:18,54 --> 0:7:21,73
You can’t improve your social standing by doing ordinary jobs

217
0:7:21,73 --> 0:7:23,69
You can only accumulate your initial capital through some

218
0:7:23,69 --> 0:7:25,23
very

219
0:7:25,23 --> 0:7:25,99
how to put it

220
0:7:25,99 --> 0:7:28,73
things that are not to be told to outsiders

221
0:7:28,73 --> 0:7:29,99
Once you've accumulated your initial capital

222
0:7:29,99 --> 0:7:32,12
you need to enter the business world and compete

223
0:7:32,12 --> 0:7:35,0
your child might be able to join the circle in the future through your investment approach

224
0:7:35,0 --> 0:7:36,32
he or she can enter this circle

225
0:7:36,32 --> 0:7:38,99
but we say that the children of mistresses tend to be good-looking

226
0:7:38,99 --> 0:7:40,47
The children of the official wife don't look good.

227
0:7:40,47 --> 0:7:42,17
The mistress herself is attractive, though.

228
0:7:42,17 --> 0:7:44,51
That's why their kids tend to go into performing arts more often.

229
0:7:44,51 --> 0:7:47,63
So if you want your child to pursue this path, it's possible.

230
0:7:47,63 --> 0:7:49,95
But it's best to finish your acting studies first.

231
0:7:49,95 --> 0:7:50,83
Then try something else.

232
0:7:50,83 --> 0:7:52,27
Like getting into business.

233
0:7:52,27 --> 0:7:53,35
Or becoming a live streamer.

234
0:7:53,35 --> 0:7:54,37
Or a social media influencer.

235
0:7:54,37 --> 0:7:56,19
Going into live streaming as a beauty influencer is totally an option.

236
0:7:56,19 --> 0:8:0,289
Because nowadays, fewer people are watching full-length films and TV series.

237
0:8:0,289 --> 0:8:2,449
Short dramas also have limited appeal.

238
0:8:2,449 --> 0:8:4,8
These forms of entertainment are gradually fading away.

239
0:8:4,8 --> 0:8:6,4
No matter how you look at it,

240
0:8:6,4 --> 0:8:7,86
the future is still the era of self-media.

241
0:8:7,86 --> 0:8:9,24
Regardless of how you put it,

242
0:8:9,24 --> 0:8:10,789
AI will also become incredibly powerful in the future.

243
0:8:10,789 --> 0:8:13,469
Acting is a profession that will gradually be replaced.

244
0:8:13,469 --> 0:8:15,869
Just like the status of Peking Opera actors today

245
0:8:15,869 --> 0:8:17,85
Just like the status of theater actors today

246
0:8:17,85 --> 0:8:19,33
For the sake of art

247
0:8:19,33 --> 0:8:21,45
Music, dance, and visual arts are all options

248
0:8:21,45 --> 0:8:22,57
You can pursue art

249
0:8:22,57 --> 0:8:25,849
But getting rich from it is almost impossible

250
0:8:25,849 --> 0:8:27,929
So many people want to become famous

251
0:8:27,929 --> 0:8:29,229
Want to get rich

252
0:8:29,229 --> 0:8:32,579
In today's era, it's becoming less and less likely

253
0:8:32,579 --> 0:8:33,539
It's not exactly impossible

254
0:8:33,539 --> 0:8:35,139
It wasn't exactly possible in the old days either

255
0:8:35,139 --> 0:8:36,179
In the studio era

256
0:8:36,179 --> 0:8:37,119
it wasn't exactly possible either

257
0:8:37,119 --> 0:8:39,199
Your looks are off the charts

258
0:8:39,199 --> 0:8:41,18
Even 14 points wouldn't help

259
0:8:41,18 --> 0:8:43,46
The key is whether your family is wealthy

260
0:8:43,46 --> 0:8:45,44
Your family isn't wealthy

261
0:8:45,44 --> 0:8:48,64
You can't score over 100 to get into the Drama Academy

262
0:8:48,64 --> 0:8:51,16
If you can't score over 100 to get into the Beijing Dance Academy,

263
0:8:51,16 --> 0:8:52,819
then you have no chance at all.

264
0:8:52,819 --> 0:8:55,219
When it comes to taking those exams,

265
0:8:55,219 --> 0:8:57,119
the actual level of these art students,

266
0:8:57,119 --> 0:8:59,109
their academic abilities are generally quite poor.

267
0:8:59,109 --> 0:9:3,349
Now, the bar for art students to enter undergraduate programs has been raised.

268
0:9:3,349 --> 0:9:4,76
But let's be honest,

269
0:9:4,76 --> 0:9:8,34
if you are someone who has had a lot of training in this area, like a vocational high school student,

270
0:9:8,34 --> 0:9:9,92
or if you're from a vocational high school,

271
0:9:9,92 --> 0:9:12,4
or a student from an attached middle school of an art institute,

272
0:9:12,4 --> 0:9:15,4
your academic performance really isn't as strong as that of regular high school students.

273
0:9:15,4 --> 0:9:18,0
But regular high school students might not be as skilled in this area.

274
0:9:18,0 --> 0:9:19,12
Looks and skills,

275
0:9:19,12 --> 0:9:20,4
they might fall short.

276
0:9:20,4 --> 0:9:22,58
They might not have had professional experience from a young age like you did.

277
0:9:22,58 --> 0:9:24,34
So it's really tough.

278
0:9:24,34 --> 0:9:26,48
Let me put it bluntly,

279
0:9:26,48 --> 0:9:29,52
the reason I can make a living online today is that

280
0:9:29,52 --> 0:9:32,4
I started working at CCTV when I was 12,

281
0:9:32,4 --> 0:9:34,69
specifically in the Youth and Children's Department.

282
0:9:34,69 --> 0:9:36,89
I spent three years there,

283
0:9:36,89 --> 0:9:37,37
right?

284
0:9:37,37 --> 0:9:38,45
From 12 to 15 years old,

285
0:9:38,45 --> 0:9:41,37
I hosted countless shows during that time,

286
0:9:41,37 --> 0:9:42,97
radio shows,

287
0:9:42,97 --> 0:9:44,25
live events,

288
0:9:44,25 --> 0:9:45,53
all sorts of shows,

289
0:9:45,53 --> 0:9:46,61
TV recordings.

290
0:9:46,61 --> 0:9:47,57
So to speak,

291
0:9:47,57 --> 0:9:50,339
it's only because of that experience that I can make a living in this field today.

292
0:9:50,339 --> 0:9:55,859
A lot of things can't be replaced by just a few sessions of learning.

293
0:9:55,859 --> 0:9:57,59
You have to have a rapport with the audience,

294
0:9:57,59 --> 0:9:59,44
and that's not something that comes easily.
