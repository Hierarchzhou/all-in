1
0:0:0,68 --> 0:0:3,2
Once servility becomes strong

2
0:0:3,2 --> 0:0:5,56
this person's character is ruined

3
0:0:5,56 --> 0:0:6,88
Generally speaking

4
0:0:6,88 --> 0:0:9,22
if a person can read between the lines

5
0:0:9,22 --> 0:0:11,34
understand the bigger picture and act accordingly

6
0:0:11,34 --> 0:0:13,24
how should I put it

7
0:0:13,24 --> 0:0:14,86
can speak smoothly and persuasively

8
0:0:14,86 --> 0:0:16,44
can be considerate

9
0:0:16,44 --> 0:0:18,2
especially perceptive and tactful

10
0:0:18,2 --> 0:0:21,13
This person is actually quite submissive.

11
0:0:21,13 --> 0:0:22,83
They are more suited for a career in public service.

12
0:0:22,83 --> 0:0:24,2
They are more suited for pursuing a master’s degree.

13
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:26,56
People like this in East Asian societies,

14
0:0:26,56 --> 0:0:29,32
make up a very large proportion of the population.

15
0:0:29,32 --> 0:0:31,3
You might be this type of person.

16
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:33,4
Especially in Japanese society,

17
0:0:33,4 --> 0:0:35,12
there are a lot of people like this.

18
0:0:35,12 --> 0:0:37,43
Superiors often bully their subordinates.

19
0:0:37,43 --> 0:0:40,19
The lifelong employment system is all about seniority and hierarchy.

20
0:0:44,56 --> 0:0:45,5
Well, how can I put it?

21
0:0:45,5 --> 0:0:46,72
It's utterly boring.

22
0:0:46,72 --> 0:0:47,84
This kind of hierarchical system

23
0:0:47,84 --> 0:0:51,18
it's holding East Asian societies back from moving forward.

24
0:0:51,18 --> 0:0:52,66
Many people say to me, Brother Rong,

25
0:0:52,66 --> 0:0:53,76
you're just a libertarian.

26
0:0:53,76 --> 0:0:55,42
What's wrong with libertarianism?

27
0:0:55,42 --> 0:0:57,18
In today's society, we talk about

28
0:0:57,18 --> 0:1:1,229
You see everything as a form of commercial exchange

29
0:1:1,229 --> 0:1:1,989
a form of communication

30
0:1:1,989 --> 0:1:2,709
a form of negotiation

31
0:1:2,709 --> 0:1:4,29
In the era of internet finance

32
0:1:4,29 --> 0:1:5,389
This is the age we live in now

33
0:1:5,389 --> 0:1:7,269
Finance dominates everything, right?

34
0:1:7,269 --> 0:1:8,69
Commodification

35
0:1:8,69 --> 0:1:10,25
After urbanization

36
0:1:10,25 --> 0:1:10,93
Industrialization

37
0:1:10,93 --> 0:1:13,49
In fact, all these things are involved in production and exchange.

38
0:1:13,49 --> 0:1:15,3
Why is the United States at the height of its power?

39
0:1:15,3 --> 0:1:17,12
It's not a matter of its political system.

40
0:1:17,12 --> 0:1:20,39
The key lies in its core social norms.

41
0:1:20,39 --> 0:1:21,83
I'm not just praising the U.S.

42
0:1:21,83 --> 0:1:24,47
But when we talk about East Asian societies, China, Japan, and South Korea,

43
0:1:24,47 --> 0:1:25,67
When we look at China, Japan, and South Korea,

44
0:1:25,67 --> 0:1:27,65
Japan and South Korea are at the level of vassal states.

45
0:1:27,65 --> 0:1:28,28
Isn't that right?

46
0:1:28,28 --> 0:1:30,44
But why does it also have this kind of issue in its development?

47
0:1:30,44 --> 0:1:32,72
What causes this kind of internal competition in East Asian societies?

48
0:1:32,72 --> 0:1:36,56
It's our obsession with hierarchical systems.

49
0:1:36,56 --> 0:1:39,58
The tendency to use any bit of power to the fullest extent.

50
0:1:43,52 --> 0:1:46,8
There's a particular reverence for such things.

51
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:47,24
Admiration for power.

52
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:48,73
Respect for authority.

53
0:1:48,73 --> 0:1:50,29
Desire for power.

54
0:1:50,29 --> 0:1:51,55
Obsession with power.

55
0:1:51,55 --> 0:1:53,21
I just want you to take the civil service exam

56
0:1:53,21 --> 0:1:54,77
I just want you to gain power in the future

57
0:1:54,77 --> 0:1:56,6
to bully others

58
0:1:56,6 --> 0:1:57,62
That's the kind of mindset

59
0:1:57,62 --> 0:1:58,7
That's not acceptable

60
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:0,78
In the modern business world

61
0:2:0,78 --> 0:2:1,9
it's all about fairness

62
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:3,3
it's all about contract spirit

63
0:2:3,3 --> 0:2:5,38
it's about following the rules

64
0:2:5,38 --> 0:2:6,48
A society governed by law

65
0:2:8,14 --> 0:2:11,1
We have never said we want to create a hierarchical society

66
0:2:11,1 --> 0:2:13,56
But in reality, there are many people

67
0:2:13,56 --> 0:2:15,26
Who want to revive the Confucian system

68
0:2:15,26 --> 0:2:16,88
And restore the rituals of the sovereign and his ministers

69
0:2:16,88 --> 0:2:19,36
And the practices of the scholar-officials and nobles

70
0:2:19,36 --> 0:2:20,92
To the real society

71
0:2:20,92 --> 0:2:22,269
I am a Brahman

72
0:2:22,269 --> 0:2:23,349
You have to listen to me

73
0:2:23,349 --> 0:2:24,309
It's not okay if it doesn't work.

74
0:2:24,309 --> 0:2:28,16
This kind of thing actually hinders social progress.

75
0:2:28,68 --> 0:2:30,72
But when it comes to the people around you,

76
0:2:30,72 --> 0:2:33,32
many of them have a stronger tendency to be submissive.

77
0:2:33,32 --> 0:2:36,32
So, this person's traits only have two extremes.

78
0:2:36,32 --> 0:2:37,12
Only two extremes.

79
0:2:37,12 --> 0:2:38,36
It is constantly evolving.

80
0:2:38,36 --> 0:2:41,13
We say that things are always what?

81
0:2:41,13 --> 0:2:42,11
One gives rise to two, two gives rise to three.

82
0:2:42,11 --> 0:2:42,89
Out of three, myriad things come to be

83
0:2:42,89 --> 0:2:44,37
I've mentioned this thing has two extremes

84
0:2:44,37 --> 0:2:47,26
This thing goes from zero to one hundred percent, right

85
0:2:47,26 --> 0:2:50,36
Actually, it's always just from 0 to 1

86
0:2:50,36 --> 0:2:51,54
Or from 1 to 0

87
0:2:51,54 --> 0:2:55,47
It all starts with an initial thought

88
0:2:55,47 --> 0:2:56,85
This thing begins to exist

89
0:2:56,85 --> 0:2:59,45
And then it falls back from this state

90
0:2:59,45 --> 0:3:0,69
To nothingness

91
0:3:0,69 --> 0:3:2,65
It's always in a state of ascending or descending.

92
0:3:2,65 --> 0:3:5,28
Because binary can represent everything in the universe.

93
0:3:5,28 --> 0:3:7,9
So why is there a three in the universe?

94
0:3:7,9 --> 0:3:9,72
Three comes from having two bits.

95
0:3:9,72 --> 0:3:13,4
With combinations like 1001 or 11.

96
0:3:13,4 --> 0:3:14,16
That's how you get three.

97
0:3:14,16 --> 0:3:16,96
Three is a combination of the two extremes.

98
0:3:16,96 --> 0:3:17,88
Either one-zero,

99
0:3:17,88 --> 0:3:18,84
or zero-one.

100
0:3:18,84 --> 0:3:19,52
It's either one

101
0:3:19,52 --> 0:3:20,81
or it's zero

102
0:3:20,81 --> 0:3:22,61
Many people might not understand this concept

103
0:3:22,61 --> 0:3:24,41
This is derived from the Daodejing

104
0:3:24,41 --> 0:3:28,32
So, all twos represent a kind of opposition

105
0:3:28,32 --> 0:3:29,8
a give-and-take relationship

106
0:3:29,8 --> 0:3:30,92
The more obedient you are

107
0:3:30,92 --> 0:3:32,12
the stronger your servility becomes

108
0:3:32,12 --> 0:3:34,35
the more rebellious you are, the stronger your individuality becomes

109
0:3:34,35 --> 0:3:38,41
When comparing East Asian societies to Western ones,

110
0:3:38,41 --> 0:3:39,47
in Western societies,

111
0:3:39,47 --> 0:3:40,81
individual personality stands out,

112
0:3:40,81 --> 0:3:43,58
I'm not saying that this is necessarily better in Western societies,

113
0:3:43,58 --> 0:3:47,0
I'm just saying they effectively utilize it for commercialization,

114
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:49,2
in the pursuit of personal freedom,

115
0:3:49,2 --> 0:3:50,4
it proves to be very useful.

116
0:3:50,4 --> 0:3:51,8
East Asian societies, on the other hand, emphasize commonality,

117
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:52,98
and emphasize conformity.

118
0:3:52,98 --> 0:3:54,2
Respect for hierarchy and seniority is important

119
0:3:54,2 --> 0:3:54,64
That's right

120
0:3:54,64 --> 0:3:56,329
Hierarchy and seniority are like that

121
0:3:56,329 --> 0:3:58,289
That's why there's a distinction between men and women

122
0:3:58,289 --> 0:3:59,609
That's why there's patriarchy

123
0:3:59,609 --> 0:4:0,969
That's why these things exist

124
0:4:0,969 --> 0:4:1,929
And there's also hierarchy

125
0:4:1,929 --> 0:4:3,1
It's all about these concepts

126
0:4:3,1 --> 0:4:5,27
Even though you want to break free from these constraints

127
0:4:5,27 --> 0:4:6,89
You need to be a person of the new era.

128
0:4:6,89 --> 0:4:8,37
You should have a revolutionary spirit.

129
0:4:8,37 --> 0:4:10,94
To always maintain a youthful revolutionary spirit,

130
0:4:10,94 --> 0:4:12,6
you must have the courage

131
0:4:12,6 --> 0:4:15,2
to break down these outdated feudal and corrupt ideas.

132
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:15,94
This spirit

133
0:4:15,94 --> 0:4:16,64
Many people say

134
0:4:16,64 --> 0:4:18,13
is about traditional Chinese learning.

135
0:4:18,13 --> 0:4:19,57
is about traditional Chinese learning.

136
0:4:19,57 --> 0:4:21,72
This is our cultural treasure.

137
0:4:21,72 --> 0:4:23,32
What do you mean by cultural treasure?

138
0:4:23,32 --> 0:4:24,82
If culture turns you into a turtle,

139
0:4:24,82 --> 0:4:26,2
then you really treat it as a treasure.

140
0:4:26,2 --> 0:4:26,72
Isn't that right?

141
0:4:26,72 --> 0:4:28,72
So often, you are this thing,

142
0:4:28,72 --> 0:4:31,0
it doesn't align with our interests in reality,

143
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:32,52
it doesn't fit our evolutionary path,

144
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:35,6
we should decisively abandon it.

145
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:35,74
It's evolution

146
0:4:35,74 --> 0:4:37,6
Isn't it about discarding the old

147
0:4:37,6 --> 0:4:38,6
and embracing the new?

148
0:4:38,6 --> 0:4:38,72
Right?

149
0:4:38,72 --> 0:4:40,64
So, Eastern and Western societies

150
0:4:40,64 --> 0:4:42,38
each have their own flaws

151
0:4:42,38 --> 0:4:44,0
if you can bridge these gaps

152
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:44,8
fill in the blanks

153
0:4:44,8 --> 0:4:47,49
it will lead to Eastern learning and Western construction

154
0:4:47,49 --> 0:4:50,49
Why not make it complementary?

155
0:4:50,49 --> 0:4:53,79
Whoever masters the advanced productive force in the future,

156
0:4:53,79 --> 0:4:55,639
whoever can push society forward,

157
0:4:55,639 --> 0:4:57,42
that's who will be right.

158
0:4:57,42 --> 0:5:0,4
Always talking about those outdated things,

159
0:5:0,4 --> 0:5:2,24
those feudal bureaucratic things.

160
0:5:2,24 --> 0:5:6,89
As I said, some places are really like that.

161
0:5:6,89 --> 0:5:8,27
Brother Rong likes to criticize,

162
0:5:8,27 --> 0:5:9,57
and sometimes likes to talk about it.

163
0:5:9,57 --> 0:5:10,59
Don't try to be like me

164
0:5:10,59 --> 0:5:12,2
because I'm getting up there in years

165
0:5:12,2 --> 0:5:14,76
and what I say doesn't carry much weight anymore

166
0:5:14,76 --> 0:5:16,3
since I'm already old

167
0:5:16,3 --> 0:5:17,4
I can't cause much of a stir anymore

168
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:18,46
unlike the young folks

169
0:5:18,46 --> 0:5:19,58
when young people get upset

170
0:5:19,58 --> 0:5:21,4
everyone gets scared

171
0:5:21,4 --> 0:5:22,3
you know, us old folks

172
0:5:22,3 --> 0:5:23,4
It's fine to chat a bit

173
0:5:23,4 --> 0:5:24,46
No one really cares

174
0:5:24,46 --> 0:5:25,12
So it's all good

175
0:5:25,12 --> 0:5:26,16
I can say whatever I want

176
0:5:26,16 --> 0:5:27,98
You young folks shouldn't jump to conclusions

177
0:5:27,98 --> 0:5:30,54
Most importantly, many companies

178
0:5:30,54 --> 0:5:32,2
Let's not name any specific ones

179
0:5:32,2 --> 0:5:36,46
But a lot of companies are addicted to meetings

180
0:5:36,46 --> 0:5:39,8
However, they don't generate profits

181
0:5:39,8 --> 0:5:40,4
Losing money every day

182
0:5:40,4 --> 0:5:41,21
Losing money every day

183
0:5:41,21 --> 0:5:43,47
But they insist on using this bureaucratic system

184
0:5:43,47 --> 0:5:44,41
To buy a ballpoint pen

185
0:5:44,41 --> 0:5:45,41
You have to file seven reports

186
0:5:45,41 --> 0:5:47,62
This kind of thing is taken to the extreme

187
0:5:47,62 --> 0:5:49,1
And then your parents tell you

188
0:5:49,1 --> 0:5:50,6
You should join this kind of company

189
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:52,16
You should apply to work for this kind of company

190
0:5:52,16 --> 0:5:53,36
You need to have a position.

191
0:5:53,36 --> 0:5:56,4
So, this kind of thing really drags down social efficiency.

192
0:5:56,4 --> 0:5:58,64
Thus, we end up with a bloated organization.

193
0:5:58,64 --> 0:6:0,58
Once there is such a place,

194
0:6:0,58 --> 0:6:3,2
it constantly acts in its own interest,

195
0:6:3,2 --> 0:6:4,48
consuming social resources.

196
0:6:4,48 --> 0:6:5,24
That’s how it is.

197
0:6:5,24 --> 0:6:7,96
So, I suggest that those who are capable,

198
0:6:7,96 --> 0:6:9,4
start private businesses.

199
0:6:9,4 --> 0:6:12,12
It's important to develop these aspects well in a private business.

200
0:6:12,12 --> 0:6:13,4
To boost the economy.

201
0:6:13,4 --> 0:6:15,45
Pang Donglai is a private enterprise, after all.

202
0:6:15,45 --> 0:6:19,17
Imagine if Pang Donglai were to undergo restructuring and become something else.

203
0:6:19,17 --> 0:6:20,15
Would that be the case?

204
0:6:20,15 --> 0:6:23,14
So, a lot of times, you need to understand these things.

205
0:6:23,14 --> 0:6:25,12
When certain types of people come together,

206
0:6:25,12 --> 0:6:29,19
they create a particular kind of living atmosphere.

207
0:6:29,19 --> 0:6:30,27
Many people often say,

208
0:6:30,27 --> 0:6:31,59
Bro Rong, I took the civil service exam.

209
0:6:31,59 --> 0:6:33,32
But later on, I couldn't adapt.

210
0:6:33,32 --> 0:6:34,88
You couldn't adapt?

211
0:6:34,88 --> 0:6:37,6
No one could really adapt to that.

212
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:39,24
If you don't have such strong servility,

213
0:6:39,24 --> 0:6:40,44
how could you adapt?

214
0:6:40,44 --> 0:6:41,56
Morning briefings every day,

215
0:6:41,56 --> 0:6:42,8
and evening reports,

216
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:44,56
what's the point of all that?

217
0:6:44,56 --> 0:6:45,5
To be honest

218
0:6:45,5 --> 0:6:48,14
in today's society, we should generate value

219
0:6:48,14 --> 0:6:49,42
they say the economy is in a downturn

220
0:6:49,42 --> 0:6:52,57
if you lack the ability to create economic value

221
0:6:52,57 --> 0:6:54,93
you're just burning through money every day

222
0:6:54,93 --> 0:6:55,89
how can that be acceptable

223
0:6:55,89 --> 0:6:56,21
right

224
0:6:56,21 --> 0:6:59,28
so in many cases, we need to conduct a thorough self-reflection

225
0:6:59,28 --> 0:7:3,46
often it's because your innovative spirit isn't strong enough

226
0:7:3,46 --> 0:7:5,72
You've also fallen out of step with the times.

227
0:7:5,72 --> 0:7:7,66
In that case, you're lagging behind others.

228
0:7:7,66 --> 0:7:10,69
That's why we often wonder why you're in the red.

229
0:7:10,69 --> 0:7:11,61
Why you run into issues.

230
0:7:11,61 --> 0:7:13,8
It's because you're too submissive.

231
0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:14,24
You don't have that.

232
0:7:14,24 --> 0:7:15,88
How do you say it?

233
0:7:15,88 --> 0:7:17,24
The ability to gauge the direction of the wind.

234
0:7:17,24 --> 0:7:18,68
Everything is about seeking guidance early on.

235
0:7:18,68 --> 0:7:19,22
Evening report

236
0:7:19,22 --> 0:7:20,84
Everything requires compliance

237
0:7:20,84 --> 0:7:22,429
This isn't the military

238
0:7:22,429 --> 0:7:23,569
The military is different

239
0:7:23,569 --> 0:7:24,589
The army has combat effectiveness

240
0:7:24,589 --> 0:7:26,45
There must be strict adherence to orders

241
0:7:26,45 --> 0:7:28,61
Some people try to run their businesses this way

242
0:7:28,61 --> 0:7:30,45
Using feudal and bureaucratic methods

243
0:7:30,45 --> 0:7:32,89
Those methods belong to the 263 years of the Qing Dynasty

244
0:7:32,89 --> 0:7:34,5
The things that are ruined

245
0:7:34,5 --> 0:7:35,71
You need to pick them up

246
0:7:35,71 --> 0:7:36,59
Those things

247
0:7:36,59 --> 0:7:37,67
So in many cases

248
0:7:37,67 --> 0:7:39,31
I think this is the driving force for progress

249
0:7:39,31 --> 0:7:40,15
A country

250
0:7:40,15 --> 0:7:43,69
The most tragic thing for a nation is not having these things

251
0:7:43,69 --> 0:7:45,21
It's a feudal inertia

252
0:7:45,21 --> 0:7:46,11
It doesn't matter

253
0:7:46,11 --> 0:7:49,9
But the most tragic thing is that in many places,

254
0:7:49,9 --> 0:7:50,74
I won’t specify which places,

255
0:7:50,74 --> 0:7:54,4
people treat these things like treasures.

256
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:55,78
Even young people fall for it,

257
0:7:55,78 --> 0:7:57,14
which is really concerning.

258
0:7:57,14 --> 0:7:59,1
I’ve seen a lot of stuff on Douyin,

259
0:7:59,1 --> 0:8:1,24
teaching people how to read between the lines,

260
0:8:1,24 --> 0:8:3,22
how to gauge others’ intentions,

261
0:8:3,22 --> 0:8:4,74
and how to set up schemes.

262
0:8:4,74 --> 0:8:7,9
Teaching people how to do harmful things

263
0:8:7,9 --> 0:8:8,21
Teaching people how to do what

264
0:8:8,21 --> 0:8:9,73
I really hate all of this

265
0:8:9,73 --> 0:8:11,49
Why I introduced Machiavellianism

266
0:8:11,49 --> 0:8:13,5
It's necessary to break all of this

267
0:8:13,5 --> 0:8:16,9
To break the notion that power should be prioritized

268
0:8:16,9 --> 0:8:19,0
Everything is about flattering power

269
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:22,14
Is this the state a person should be in in modern society

270
0:8:22,14 --> 0:8:22,88
I'm asking you

271
0:8:22,88 --> 0:8:23,96
So, let's talk about it.

272
0:8:23,96 --> 0:8:27,4
For a society to move forward, it must develop in a positive direction.

273
0:8:27,4 --> 0:8:29,0
We are now, in my view,

274
0:8:29,0 --> 0:8:30,68
already a moderately developed country.

275
0:8:30,68 --> 0:8:32,56
We should have a normal business culture.

276
0:8:32,56 --> 0:8:34,14
We can't still prioritize agriculture over commerce.

277
0:8:34,14 --> 0:8:35,3
Are you a farmer?

278
0:8:35,3 --> 0:8:36,36
You don't even farm.

279
0:8:36,36 --> 0:8:36,66
Right?

280
0:8:36,66 --> 0:8:37,54
You just be yourself

281
0:8:37,54 --> 0:8:38,8
cultivate your own bit of authority

282
0:8:38,8 --> 0:8:40,349
so this is extremely terrifying

283
0:8:40,349 --> 0:8:42,109
I say people need to change their servile nature

284
0:8:42,109 --> 0:8:46,309
and must stop fawning and kowtowing to power

285
0:8:46,309 --> 0:8:49,48
that kind of fear is incredibly terrifying

286
0:8:49,48 --> 0:8:52,3
don't think I'm always criticizing the people of Jing-Jin-Ji

287
0:8:52,3 --> 0:8:53,4
of course

288
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:54,4
this time we can't include Hebei

289
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:57,56
What makes the people of Beijing and Tianjin so strong

290
0:8:57,56 --> 0:8:58,46
You know what

291
0:8:58,46 --> 0:9:0,89
It's that they're not afraid of officials

292
0:9:0,89 --> 0:9:1,689
Why should they be afraid of officials?

293
0:9:1,689 --> 0:9:4,369
I have a classmate who came from another place to study

294
0:9:4,369 --> 0:9:5,769
I'm not saying anything about him

295
0:9:5,769 --> 0:9:7,309
One time, we were walking down the street

296
0:9:7,309 --> 0:9:9,78
Suddenly, his legs went weak

297
0:9:9,78 --> 0:9:12,6
Oh, he said, 'That's the county seat back home'

298
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:14,22
The local big official

299
0:9:14,22 --> 0:9:14,74
The top leader

300
0:9:14,74 --> 0:9:15,37
Oh

301
0:9:15,37 --> 0:9:17,31
My legs are shaking

302
0:9:17,31 --> 0:9:19,64
Really shaking, they are

303
0:9:19,64 --> 0:9:20,64
Then he said

304
0:9:20,64 --> 0:9:22,32
That person is incredibly wealthy

305
0:9:22,32 --> 0:9:24,32
And has immense power

306
0:9:24,32 --> 0:9:25,329
Really formidable

307
0:9:25,329 --> 0:9:27,9
I thought he was coming to Beijing.

308
0:9:27,9 --> 0:9:28,729
What’s so great about him?

309
0:9:28,729 --> 0:9:29,89
Right?

310
0:9:29,89 --> 0:9:30,289
Then he would have to come over too, wouldn’t he?

311
0:9:30,289 --> 0:9:31,489
When he comes over, he’s just an ordinary person.

312
0:9:31,489 --> 0:9:32,669
I’m a native of the capital city.

313
0:9:32,669 --> 0:9:33,839
I damn well don’t care about you.

314
0:9:33,839 --> 0:9:34,719
Right?

315
0:9:34,719 --> 0:9:36,959
So, it’s this spirit of not fearing authority that we’re talking about.

316
0:9:36,959 --> 0:9:38,279
People in Beijing and Tianjin don’t buy that.

317
0:9:38,279 --> 0:9:40,66
Don’t try to intimidate me with your power.

318
0:9:40,66 --> 0:9:42,82
For 300 or 400 years in Beijing,

319
0:9:42,82 --> 0:9:44,54
there have been plenty of princes and nobles.

320
0:9:44,54 --> 0:9:45,82
What kind of act are you putting on with me?

321
0:9:45,82 --> 0:9:48,96
Are you kidding, using a Ming dynasty sword to execute officials of this dynasty?

322
0:9:48,96 --> 0:9:50,58
Are you holding a rotten fish or what?

323
0:9:50,58 --> 0:9:51,839
Do you really think you’re something special?

324
0:9:51,839 --> 0:9:52,839
That’s why I’m asking you.

325
0:9:52,839 --> 0:9:56,99
What's most crucial for us young people is to break this culture of being obsessed with officialdom.

326
0:9:56,99 --> 0:9:57,379
The worship of power.

327
0:9:57,379 --> 0:9:58,539
No, that's not it.

328
0:9:58,539 --> 0:10:0,72
Having no respect for the law in one's heart.

329
0:10:0,72 --> 0:10:1,52
That's not what it's about.

330
0:10:1,52 --> 0:10:2,84
It's about not bowing down to authority,

331
0:10:2,84 --> 0:10:5,72
Not blindly fawning over individuals.

332
0:10:5,72 --> 0:10:7,41
It's meaningless.

333
0:10:7,41 --> 0:10:9,19
We should have ideals in our hearts.

334
0:10:9,19 --> 0:10:10,1
Be ethical

335
0:10:10,1 --> 0:10:12,21
have a spirit of the rule of law

336
0:10:12,21 --> 0:10:16,0
don't engage in those feudal practices for no reason

337
0:10:16,0 --> 0:10:18,96
everything should be about seeking approval and reporting first

338
0:10:18,96 --> 0:10:22,16
a lot of the time, these things are incredibly boring

339
0:10:22,16 --> 0:10:25,16
these things really slow down the pace of societal progress

340
0:10:25,16 --> 0:10:27,61
we say that people should keep moving forward

341
0:10:27,61 --> 0:10:28,63
keep developing

342
0:10:28,63 --> 0:10:29,47
keep evolving

343
0:10:29,47 --> 0:10:30,63
constantly seeking true knowledge

344
0:10:30,63 --> 0:10:31,43
constantly verifying

345
0:10:31,43 --> 0:10:32,11
constantly falsifying

346
0:10:32,11 --> 0:10:34,14
that is the spirit of science

347
0:10:35,86 --> 0:10:36,86
the spirit of science

348
0:10:36,86 --> 0:10:38,18
rather than certain things

349
0:10:38,18 --> 0:10:39,94
spending the whole day, how to put it

350
0:10:39,94 --> 0:10:42,48
once you're on the royal payroll, you start doing things against your conscience

351
0:10:42,48 --> 0:10:44,2
that's not serving the people either

352
0:10:44,2 --> 0:10:44,72
Right?

353
0:10:44,72 --> 0:10:46,22
You're serving yourself, right?

354
0:10:46,22 --> 0:10:46,76
Right?

355
0:10:46,76 --> 0:10:48,46
So often we say

356
0:10:48,46 --> 0:10:51,8
If you want to break out of this mindset

357
0:10:51,8 --> 0:10:52,58
First, don't just assume

358
0:10:52,58 --> 0:10:54,18
Everything is right because parents say so

359
0:10:54,18 --> 0:10:55,9
Everything is right because teachers and schools say so

360
0:10:55,9 --> 0:10:58,43
Question more things

361
0:10:58,43 --> 0:11:0,23
Doubt everything around you

362
0:11:0,23 --> 0:11:1,47
That's when things get interesting

363
0:11:1,47 --> 0:11:2,69
Otherwise, you'll live

364
0:11:2,69 --> 0:11:4,79
In your twenties like a sixty-year-old

365
0:11:4,79 --> 0:11:5,9
What's the point of that?

366
0:11:5,9 --> 0:11:8,1
Brother Rong was also very restless in his youth

367
0:11:8,1 --> 0:11:10,1
But now he's much more peaceful

368
0:11:10,1 --> 0:11:11,81
Why, when we have more now

369
0:11:11,81 --> 0:11:14,37
We should always maintain a youthful state

370
0:11:14,37 --> 0:11:16,41
Always engage in self-criticism

371
0:11:16,41 --> 0:11:18,59
Always adjust to societal norms

372
0:11:18,59 --> 0:11:20,2
This is something that should always be done

373
0:11:20,2 --> 0:11:23,22
My ideal is to promote the development of commercial culture

374
0:11:23,22 --> 0:11:25,18
To promote the exchange of ideas between the East and West

375
0:11:25,18 --> 0:11:26,1
A combination

376
0:11:26,1 --> 0:11:27,43
Mutual complementation

377
0:11:27,43 --> 0:11:30,35
You can't say we've entered the 21st century

378
0:11:30,35 --> 0:11:31,79
And now we're bringing back feudal practices

379
0:11:31,79 --> 0:11:33,47
Things that have been rotten for thousands of years

380
0:11:33,47 --> 0:11:36,36
Things that have made us weak and impoverished are being revived

381
0:11:36,36 --> 0:11:38,2
Is this called maintaining revolutionary youth?

382
0:11:38,2 --> 0:11:39,0
What is this?

383
0:11:39,0 --> 0:11:39,32
Right?

384
0:11:39,32 --> 0:11:40,48
This is a kind of

385
0:11:40,48 --> 0:11:44,1
To put it bluntly, you don't have that genuine concern for others

386
0:11:44,1 --> 0:11:45,82
You don't have a pure heart to serve

387
0:11:45,82 --> 0:11:48,84
You're just serving your own power

388
0:11:48,84 --> 0:11:50,8
You're doing this

389
0:11:50,8 --> 0:11:51,8
You're just making a show

390
0:11:51,8 --> 0:11:52,69
So this is what we call class solidification

391
0:11:52,69 --> 0:11:55,47
This is what we call the revival of feudal forces

392
0:11:55,47 --> 0:11:57,92
These are the things that should be prevented first

393
0:11:57,92 --> 0:12:0,8
We talk about a young person

394
0:12:0,8 --> 0:12:2,48
If he also kneels and licks

395
0:12:2,48 --> 0:12:3,64
If he also shows up with no dignity

396
0:12:3,64 --> 0:12:4,74
With a servile attitude

397
0:12:4,74 --> 0:12:5,98
If this is the case

398
0:12:5,98 --> 0:12:6,8
Then this society is truly pitiful

399
0:12:6,8 --> 0:12:9,16
That would make this society too pitiful.
