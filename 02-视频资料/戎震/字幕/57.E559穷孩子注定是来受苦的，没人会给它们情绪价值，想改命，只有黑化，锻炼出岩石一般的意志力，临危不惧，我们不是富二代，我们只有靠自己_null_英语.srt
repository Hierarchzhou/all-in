1
0:0:0,56 --> 0:0:4,15
It's 04:30 in the early morning.

2
0:0:4,51 --> 0:0:6,97
If you're in a really good mood,

3
0:0:6,97 --> 0:0:9,49
then you shouldn't watch this video.

4
0:0:9,49 --> 0:0:12,469
In fact, wait until you're feeling a bit down,

5
0:0:12,469 --> 0:0:14,149
and then come back to watch this batch of videos.

6
0:0:14,149 --> 0:0:18,329
Because in this video, I posted four statuses on my Moments in the middle of the night,

7
0:0:18,329 --> 0:0:22,29
complaining about two girls I know.

8
0:0:22,29 --> 0:0:24,53
These two girls are from wealthy families,

9
0:0:24,53 --> 0:0:27,56
and both of them claim to have depression.

10
0:0:27,56 --> 0:0:31,0
Then these two people both wanted to make money through creating media content.

11
0:0:31,0 --> 0:0:31,94
Monetize

12
0:0:31,94 --> 0:0:34,38
They came to me for advice.

13
0:0:34,38 --> 0:0:34,74
Sigh

14
0:0:34,74 --> 0:0:37,11
That was their biggest mistake.

15
0:0:37,11 --> 0:0:41,84
Because asking me would only result in harsh criticism.

16
0:0:41,84 --> 0:0:43,58
Many people say,

17
0:0:43,58 --> 0:0:44,52
Brother Rong,

18
0:0:44,52 --> 0:0:45,9
My cyber godfather

19
0:0:45,9 --> 0:0:47,66
You're my soul massage.

20
0:0:47,66 --> 0:0:50,12
You're the ultimate sleep companion.

21
0:0:50,12 --> 0:0:52,63
That's a trait I have.

22
0:0:52,63 --> 0:0:56,629
But in reality, I have an ENTJ personality.

23
0:0:56,629 --> 0:1:0,65
What irritates me the most is stupidity.

24
0:1:0,65 --> 0:1:3,93
Before putting in the effort.

25
0:1:3,93 --> 0:1:6,47
When someone just scratches the surface.

26
0:1:6,47 --> 0:1:8,41
Wasting my time.

27
0:1:8,41 --> 0:1:10,27
Draining my energy.

28
0:1:10,27 --> 0:1:12,71
Then go and ask some pointless questions

29
0:1:12,71 --> 0:1:16,28
You’re putting your self-esteem on a pedestal

30
0:1:16,28 --> 0:1:19,36
Your pride can’t be touched at all

31
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:20,88
They’re all from wealthy families

32
0:1:20,88 --> 0:1:25,13
With a mindset of trying, they also want to do media

33
0:1:25,13 --> 0:1:27,47
I can manage eight accounts in one go

34
0:1:27,47 --> 0:1:30,3
I want to update my grandparents' life

35
0:1:30,3 --> 0:1:33,27
I don’t think I’m someone without a career

36
0:1:33,27 --> 0:1:35,18
That’s how it is

37
0:1:35,18 --> 0:1:37,28
Let me read these few WeChat Moments.

38
0:1:37,28 --> 0:1:38,38
They're all insults.

39
0:1:38,38 --> 0:1:41,8
You'll get a real sense of my personality after this.

40
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:44,4
Each one is harsher than the last.

41
0:1:44,6 --> 0:1:45,96
Even though it was midnight,

42
0:1:45,96 --> 0:1:48,22
it still got over 50 likes.

43
0:1:48,22 --> 0:1:52,77
In other words, the people around me are all night owls.

44
0:1:53,37 --> 0:1:54,83
Woke up from a nightmare,

45
0:1:54,83 --> 0:1:57,1
I asked Deep Sick two questions.

46
0:1:57,1 --> 0:2:1,87
Ask him to provide the best investment advice given my current asset status

47
0:2:1,87 --> 0:2:7,3
and the best operational strategy for the development of my current career

48
0:2:7,51 --> 0:2:10,63
Most of the answers I got were within the average range

49
0:2:10,63 --> 0:2:13,93
and didn't offer very specific actionable advice

50
0:2:13,93 --> 0:2:17,1
but rather a pile of common information and negative numbers

51
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:19,839
talking a lot of nonsense that even beginners know

52
0:2:19,839 --> 0:2:22,659
but the core of the issue was never addressed

53
0:2:22,659 --> 0:2:25,52
and no one would feed him with useful information

54
0:2:25,52 --> 0:2:26,8
even if it were provided

55
0:2:26,8 --> 0:2:28,48
It won't be the mainstream information

56
0:2:28,48 --> 0:2:33,2
It seems that relying on large AI models for business advice is still premature

57
0:2:33,2 --> 0:2:36,14
Fancy talk is utterly useless

58
0:2:36,14 --> 0:2:39,62
What truly works isn’t written in books

59
0:2:39,62 --> 0:2:41,38
It’s not taught in classrooms

60
0:2:41,38 --> 0:2:44,78
The real business wisdom often comes down to a single sentence

61
0:2:44,78 --> 0:2:48,14
Most of it is about how to cleverly bend the rules

62
0:2:48,14 --> 0:2:50,98
To profit from loopholes without getting caught

63
0:2:50,98 --> 0:2:53,56
These are all pretty dark practices

64
0:2:53,96 --> 0:2:56,18
Let AI help you analyze accurate information

65
0:2:56,18 --> 0:2:57,56
It's like finding a needle in a haystack

66
0:2:57,56 --> 0:3:0,34
The premise of intelligence analysis is to listen to more sources

67
0:3:0,34 --> 0:3:1,29
and dig deeper

68
0:3:1,29 --> 0:3:3,829
to truly distill useful information

69
0:3:3,829 --> 0:3:5,189
I now spend over ten hours a day reading books

70
0:3:5,189 --> 0:3:7,349
and watching long videos

71
0:3:7,349 --> 0:3:9,709
Only by consuming a large volume can you sift out the valuable information

72
0:3:9,709 --> 0:3:14,35
not those who don't quit their jobs to pursue a career in media

73
0:3:14,35 --> 0:3:15,66
Look, the criticism is starting to roll in.

74
0:3:15,66 --> 0:3:20,6
I can only say that your expertise can't match us full-time bloggers.

75
0:3:20,6 --> 0:3:22,209
Especially those with a team.

76
0:3:22,209 --> 0:3:25,909
This field is now saturated with fierce competition.

77
0:3:25,909 --> 0:3:27,749
If your work is just average,

78
0:3:27,749 --> 0:3:29,68
and your advice is too vague,

79
0:3:29,68 --> 0:3:31,66
it’s just like Deep Seek.

80
0:3:31,66 --> 0:3:34,56
You might as well not enter the industry and build a personal brand.

81
0:3:34,56 --> 0:3:35,66
If you don’t put in the time,

82
0:3:35,66 --> 0:3:38,3
Why should users like you?

83
0:3:38,3 --> 0:3:41,49
This is the most mild one among my four WeChat Moments posts.

84
0:3:41,49 --> 0:3:43,41
Let me read the second one to you.

85
0:3:43,65 --> 0:3:45,3
Either go full-time,

86
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:46,7
or don't do it at all.

87
0:3:46,7 --> 0:3:48,26
I'm just putting pressure on these two people.

88
0:3:48,26 --> 0:3:49,82
There's no second way.

89
0:3:49,82 --> 0:3:52,8
It's not about whether you're overworking or not,

90
0:3:52,8 --> 0:3:54,36
it's about your intelligence being insufficient.

91
0:3:54,36 --> 0:3:59,71
I never thought that all this blind effort would just move me

92
0:3:59,71 --> 0:4:2,21
In the end, it’s all for nothing

93
0:4:2,81 --> 0:4:3,73
Everything’s fallen apart

94
0:4:3,73 --> 0:4:4,55
I’ll carry on

95
0:4:4,55 --> 0:4:6,21
It’s your IQ that’s lacking

96
0:4:6,21 --> 0:4:10,69
I never thought that all this blind effort would just move me

97
0:4:10,69 --> 0:4:12,459
In the end, it’s all for nothing

98
0:4:12,459 --> 0:4:14,39
Every single one of them

99
0:4:14,39 --> 0:4:16,46
You guys who’ve been watching me do this media thing

100
0:4:16,46 --> 0:4:18,52
Those who felt they could do it

101
0:4:18,52 --> 0:4:21,909
A few of them were fully committed

102
0:4:21,909 --> 0:4:23,969
These UPloaders around me

103
0:4:23,969 --> 0:4:26,109
Regardless of which category they're in

104
0:4:26,109 --> 0:4:28,89
As long as they achieve a significant scale

105
0:4:28,89 --> 0:4:30,149
Which one isn't like a madman

106
0:4:30,149 --> 0:4:33,22
Busting their guts for you outsiders

107
0:4:33,22 --> 0:4:34,2
Crazy

108
0:4:35,48 --> 0:4:38,51
How many of them aren't just trying it out

109
0:4:38,51 --> 0:4:40,75
Serves you right for not being able to do it.

110
0:4:40,75 --> 0:4:43,47
Damn, not even thinking about it.

111
0:4:43,47 --> 0:4:44,51
Not trying at all.

112
0:4:44,51 --> 0:4:45,63
Not using your brain.

113
0:4:45,63 --> 0:4:47,82
Born both cowardly and stupid.

114
0:4:47,82 --> 0:4:49,64
So you end up like this.

115
0:4:49,64 --> 0:4:50,62
Don't blame others.

116
0:4:50,62 --> 0:4:51,66
Blame yourself.

117
0:4:51,66 --> 0:4:52,9
Only see the thief getting the rewards.

118
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:53,92
You can't just complain about the thief without doing anything.

119
0:4:53,92 --> 0:4:56,1
It's not enough to just envy others' success.

120
0:4:56,1 --> 0:5:0,539
While others shed tears all night and get back up to keep going, you need to do the same.

121
0:5:0,539 --> 0:5:2,479
A few nasty comments in the comment section,

122
0:5:2,479 --> 0:5:4,439
and your ego shatters.

123
0:5:4,439 --> 0:5:6,779
What a load of nonsense.

124
0:5:6,779 --> 0:5:10,9
You haven't even reached the point where you need to rely on talent.

125
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:12,57
See how others do it,

126
0:5:12,57 --> 0:5:14,9
and give it a try yourself.

127
0:5:14,9 --> 0:5:16,49
Getting a little success and getting cocky

128
0:5:16,49 --> 0:5:19,17
Then working for three days and slacking off for two

129
0:5:19,17 --> 0:5:20,72
Damn it

130
0:5:20,72 --> 0:5:22,28
I even dream about it

131
0:5:22,28 --> 0:5:23,52
What we’re shooting the next day

132
0:5:23,52 --> 0:5:24,84
Taking notes all the time

133
0:5:24,84 --> 0:5:27,9
Posting on social media like a madman

134
0:5:27,9 --> 0:5:28,99
It’s also to document my feelings

135
0:5:28,99 --> 0:5:30,99
Only emotions can truly spread

136
0:5:30,99 --> 0:5:33,43
You might want to stay out of our industry.

137
0:5:33,43 --> 0:5:36,18
It could make a lot of people think it’s all too easy.

138
0:5:36,18 --> 0:5:39,34
Anyone could do this crap.

139
0:5:39,34 --> 0:5:41,44
It’s the same story wherever you go.

140
0:5:41,44 --> 0:5:43,2
This is the second one.

141
0:5:43,2 --> 0:5:45,52
The third one is even harsher, though.

142
0:5:45,52 --> 0:5:48,93
You’re not a kid anymore at 30.

143
0:5:48,93 --> 0:5:51,37
Without your own career,

144
0:5:51,37 --> 0:5:53,79
your life will get darker and darker.

145
0:5:53,79 --> 0:5:56,1
What the hell kind of childish mentality is this?

146
0:5:56,1 --> 0:5:57,47
There's a lot of Mom in that.

147
0:5:57,47 --> 0:6:0,9
A few words and you're already depressed, wanting to take pills.

148
0:6:0,9 --> 0:6:2,92
Often, it can only be said that human society isn't suitable for you.

149
0:6:2,92 --> 0:6:6,8
Heaven's movement is healthy; the gentleman thus strives unceasingly.

150
0:6:6,8 --> 0:6:11,53
You spoiled rich kids, living in luxury, are nothing but useless.

151
0:6:11,53 --> 0:6:14,69
You wouldn't understand people like us who started from scratch.

152
0:6:14,69 --> 0:6:17,73
To get to where we are today, on equal footing with you,

153
0:6:17,73 --> 0:6:20,14
We've endured so much hardship.

154
0:6:20,5 --> 0:6:23,42
The skills we rely on to survive in society

155
0:6:23,42 --> 0:6:24,72
have been built through tears

156
0:6:24,72 --> 0:6:25,6
and blood

157
0:6:25,6 --> 0:6:28,15
pieced together bit by bit

158
0:6:28,15 --> 0:6:31,69
What makes you think watching a video makes you an expert?

159
0:6:31,69 --> 0:6:36,7
You're just protecting your pathetic self-esteem

160
0:6:36,7 --> 0:6:37,91
When your parents are gone

161
0:6:37,91 --> 0:6:40,8
you won't be anything

162
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:42,34
The more I talk, the more disgusted I feel

163
0:6:42,34 --> 0:6:43,64
The more I talk, the harsher it gets

164
0:6:43,64 --> 0:6:46,32
And the last one is ENTJ

165
0:6:46,32 --> 0:6:50,33
Equally despising all scum, fools, and plagues

166
0:6:50,33 --> 0:6:53,11
I have no obligation to cater to your emotions

167
0:6:53,11 --> 0:6:55,2
That’s your mother’s job

168
0:6:55,2 --> 0:6:56,52
The law of nature

169
0:6:56,52 --> 0:6:57,5
Survival of the fittest

170
0:6:57,5 --> 0:6:58,4
The survival of the adapted

171
0:6:58,4 --> 0:7:0,77
I have no use for inferior genetic traits

172
0:7:0,77 --> 0:7:2,27
Your empathy

173
0:7:2,27 --> 0:7:3,77
You should be eliminated

174
0:7:3,77 --> 0:7:7,29
Instead of gaining any emotional value

175
0:7:7,77 --> 0:7:9,63
It's precisely because of your weakness

176
0:7:9,63 --> 0:7:10,95
Your habitual avoidance

177
0:7:10,95 --> 0:7:12,33
Chasing emotional satisfaction

178
0:7:12,33 --> 0:7:14,43
That's what makes you extremely vulnerable

179
0:7:14,43 --> 0:7:15,67
Timid and sensitive

180
0:7:15,67 --> 0:7:18,67
Such a person doesn't have the qualifications to be an excellent entrepreneur

181
0:7:18,67 --> 0:7:19,97
Or a qualified parent

182
0:7:19,97 --> 0:7:22,57
cannot be considered a true adult

183
0:7:22,57 --> 0:7:25,71
The internet has been too good to you

184
0:7:25,71 --> 0:7:27,41
various information bubbles

185
0:7:27,41 --> 0:7:30,53
making you feel great about how unique your personality is

186
0:7:30,53 --> 0:7:31,63
very charming

187
0:7:31,63 --> 0:7:33,11
Ah, I am a lover

188
0:7:33,11 --> 0:7:34,34
I am the beloved

189
0:7:34,34 --> 0:7:36,2
I have my own brilliance

190
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:40,21
Well, a defective product is just that – defective.

191
0:7:40,21 --> 0:7:41,11
Of course, let’s talk about it.

192
0:7:41,11 --> 0:7:41,93
To be honest,

193
0:7:41,93 --> 0:7:44,17
I know what I’m saying might sound harsh,

194
0:7:44,17 --> 0:7:46,64
but why do I say it this way?

195
0:7:46,675 --> 0:7:48,86
Because in this world,

196
0:7:48,86 --> 0:7:50,54
especially in society,

197
0:7:50,54 --> 0:7:52,74
there’s no one who will truly feel sorry for you.

198
0:7:52,74 --> 0:7:55,14
Many people will provide you with emotional support.

199
0:7:55,14 --> 0:7:57,64
I'm here to provide you with emotional support.

200
0:7:57,64 --> 0:7:59,88
But kids, I have something to say.

201
0:7:59,88 --> 0:8:2,28
Providing you with emotional support

202
0:8:2,28 --> 0:8:5,64
is meant to make you feel good.

203
0:8:6,12 --> 0:8:8,2
After feeling good,

204
0:8:8,2 --> 0:8:10,92
one should know shame and then become courageous.

205
0:8:10,92 --> 0:8:12,3
If you don't even know shame,

206
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:13,72
and no one pushes you,

207
0:8:13,72 --> 0:8:15,48
how can you move forward?

208
0:8:15,48 --> 0:8:17,26
Watch food vlogs every day

209
0:8:17,26 --> 0:8:19,44
See how to travel in Japan

210
0:8:19,44 --> 0:8:21,92
Check out how to make money online

211
0:8:21,92 --> 0:8:24,51
Watch a few very elegant videos

212
0:8:24,51 --> 0:8:26,57
With a really nice background music

213
0:8:26,57 --> 0:8:27,29
Isn't it

214
0:8:27,29 --> 0:8:29,25
Then boom-chicka-boom-chicka

215
0:8:29,25 --> 0:8:30,21
Sipping on bubble tea

216
0:8:30,21 --> 0:8:31,82
Eating fried chicken cutlets

217
0:8:31,82 --> 0:8:33,88
And so the day begins.

218
0:8:33,88 --> 0:8:36,6
You haven’t even moved a muscle.

219
0:8:36,6 --> 0:8:37,86
You haven’t burned a single calorie.

220
0:8:37,86 --> 0:8:38,95
Right?

221
0:8:38,95 --> 0:8:42,77
You’re just pretending to put in effort.

222
0:8:42,77 --> 0:8:45,21
Then I got fired from my job, uh.

223
0:8:45,21 --> 0:8:46,85
I’ve run into some unpleasant situations.

224
0:8:46,85 --> 0:8:47,13
Oh.

225
0:8:47,13 --> 0:8:48,89
A follower scolded me, uh.

226
0:8:48,89 --> 0:8:49,63
Someone left a comment

227
0:8:49,63 --> 0:8:51,12
Someone sent me a private message to insult me

228
0:8:51,12 --> 0:8:53,48
Oh, what about my self-esteem?

229
0:8:53,48 --> 0:8:55,56
Then I won’t do it next time

230
0:8:55,56 --> 0:8:56,32
Oh

231
0:8:56,32 --> 0:8:57,28
That’s it

232
0:8:57,28 --> 0:8:58,76
So many times you’ll find

233
0:8:58,76 --> 0:9:2,37
What has society become now?

234
0:9:2,37 --> 0:9:4,11
The era of neoliberalism

235
0:9:4,11 --> 0:9:5,78
It's often quite amusing

236
0:9:5,78 --> 0:9:7,38
no matter what your sexual orientation is

237
0:9:7,38 --> 0:9:9,14
no matter what your gender is

238
0:9:9,14 --> 0:9:12,97
no matter what unique personality traits you have

239
0:9:12,97 --> 0:9:15,67
there are 16 types in the MBTI, right?

240
0:9:15,67 --> 0:9:17,54
there are 12 zodiac signs

241
0:9:17,54 --> 0:9:19,24
Bro Rong even came up with 25 personality types

242
0:9:19,24 --> 0:9:22,38
you're definitely special

243
0:9:22,38 --> 0:9:23,58
You are unique

244
0:9:23,58 --> 0:9:24,6
You are not weak

245
0:9:24,6 --> 0:9:25,68
You are special

246
0:9:25,68 --> 0:9:27,9
You are a unique individual

247
0:9:27,9 --> 0:9:32,46
In reality

248
0:9:33,6 --> 0:9:36,24
Many parents are very strict

249
0:9:36,24 --> 0:9:37,4
Teachers are also very strict

250
0:9:37,4 --> 0:9:39,16
Once they get away from this system

251
0:9:39,16 --> 0:9:41,38
They will feel, honestly

252
0:9:41,38 --> 0:9:43,34
Parents put all sorts of pressure on me

253
0:9:43,34 --> 0:9:45,42
It led to my depression.

254
0:9:45,42 --> 0:9:47,49
I have depression.

255
0:9:47,81 --> 0:9:49,93
But is that really how others see it?

256
0:9:51,1 --> 0:9:52,83
Many people are frustrated with you, wishing you could be better.

257
0:9:52,83 --> 0:9:55,3
I really understand this kind of parent.

258
0:9:55,54 --> 0:9:58,48
Of course, many parents lack education.

259
0:9:58,48 --> 0:9:59,44
And they don’t understand psychology.

260
0:9:59,44 --> 0:10:0,7
Nor do they know much about education.

261
0:10:0,7 --> 0:10:3,96
They want to mold you into a different person.

262
0:10:3,96 --> 0:10:4,96
Actually, that's not good either.

263
0:10:4,96 --> 0:10:5,96
Because different people...

264
0:10:5,96 --> 0:10:7,67
Each monkey needs a different approach.

265
0:10:7,67 --> 0:10:9,71
But let me be frank...

266
0:10:9,71 --> 0:10:13,37
Who gives you emotional support in this society?

267
0:10:14,1 --> 0:10:16,13
Who provides you with emotional value?

268
0:10:18,18 --> 0:10:20,46
Who would give you emotional value for free?

269
0:10:21,62 --> 0:10:23,6
When you come to me for consultation...

270
0:10:23,6 --> 0:10:25,65
Aren't you paying for it?

271
0:10:25,85 --> 0:10:27,17
When you're not spending money

272
0:10:27,17 --> 0:10:29,61
would I provide you with emotional support for free?

273
0:10:30,65 --> 0:10:31,65
You added me on WeChat

274
0:10:31,65 --> 0:10:32,93
which means you're my friend now

275
0:10:32,93 --> 0:10:33,96
No way

276
0:10:33,96 --> 0:10:34,96
Right?

277
0:10:34,96 --> 0:10:37,32
In this world, nothing is free

278
0:10:37,32 --> 0:10:39,98
that truly offers emotional value

279
0:10:40,18 --> 0:10:41,54
Ah, watch my videos

280
0:10:41,54 --> 0:10:42,72
You've received encouragement

281
0:10:42,72 --> 0:10:44,12
And then?

282
0:10:44,12 --> 0:10:47,99
What would you do to truly make me happy?

283
0:10:47,99 --> 0:10:50,7
After you power up

284
0:10:50,7 --> 0:10:53,77
When you become a super fan, the words 'Enterprise Owner' will appear next to your name

285
0:10:53,77 --> 0:10:54,37
Isn't that right?

286
0:10:54,37 --> 0:10:57,63
That's what I genuinely hope for you

287
0:10:57,63 --> 0:10:59,69
Now, when you do a little bit

288
0:10:59,69 --> 0:11:0,57
Behind it all

289
0:11:0,57 --> 0:11:2,97
Bro Rong gave me a mental massage.

290
0:11:2,97 --> 0:11:4,57
What's the point of that?

291
0:11:4,57 --> 0:11:6,23
After you get a mental massage,

292
0:11:6,23 --> 0:11:8,13
you receive healing.

293
0:11:8,13 --> 0:11:9,91
I'm of course very happy.

294
0:11:9,91 --> 0:11:12,19
Because so many people have really worked hard.

295
0:11:12,19 --> 0:11:14,7
Many people need this encouragement.

296
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:16,95
But what can truly change your fate?

297
0:11:16,95 --> 0:11:18,85
I ask you, buddy.

298
0:11:19,37 --> 0:11:22,25
Let's lick our wounds

299
0:11:22,25 --> 0:11:24,38
Give each other a lick on the behind

300
0:11:24,38 --> 0:11:25,54
Comfort each other

301
0:11:25,54 --> 0:11:26,26
Pat each other on the back

302
0:11:26,26 --> 0:11:27,22
Then shake hands

303
0:11:27,22 --> 0:11:27,86
You're good, I'm good

304
0:11:27,86 --> 0:11:28,58
Everyone's good

305
0:11:28,58 --> 0:11:31,5
Society will start to favor us

306
0:11:31,5 --> 0:11:33,97
Society will start to allocate more resources to us

307
0:11:33,97 --> 0:11:38,28
Can the rich just give away their interests so easily?

308
0:11:38,28 --> 0:11:40,4
You, as a child of a commoner,

309
0:11:40,4 --> 0:11:42,46
can just sit back and get everything without effort?

310
0:11:42,46 --> 0:11:46,929
Do you think that if I say it, a million-dollar mansion will just appear?

311
0:11:46,929 --> 0:11:48,149
Is that how it works?

312
0:11:48,149 --> 0:11:50,339
Is that really how it is, buddy?

313
0:11:50,339 --> 0:11:52,819
Think about it carefully, is that how it is?

314
0:11:52,819 --> 0:11:54,859
Why is it that in many cases,

315
0:11:54,859 --> 0:11:57,44
I actually don't have such a strong sense of empathy?

316
0:11:57,68 --> 0:11:59,74
I don’t actually want to cater to your emotions.

317
0:11:59,74 --> 0:12:1,68
Although, to be honest, a lot of the time,

318
0:12:1,68 --> 0:12:4,1
people say I provide emotional value to you.

319
0:12:4,1 --> 0:12:5,98
But in reality, most of the time,

320
0:12:5,98 --> 0:12:8,19
I’m actually a lot like your parents.

321
0:12:8,19 --> 0:12:9,63
I feel the same frustration when you don’t live up to your potential.

322
0:12:9,63 --> 0:12:12,89
It’s just that I tend to be more patient and guiding in my approach.

323
0:12:12,89 --> 0:12:13,769
I break things down for you,

324
0:12:13,769 --> 0:12:14,509
and explain them in detail.

325
0:12:14,509 --> 0:12:17,969
But when you really have to face life one day

326
0:12:17,969 --> 0:12:20,23
When you have to deal with not being able to pay the rent

327
0:12:20,23 --> 0:12:22,47
When you have to handle a boss who’s pushing you to the limit

328
0:12:22,47 --> 0:12:24,31
What are you going to do

329
0:12:25,16 --> 0:12:26,64
Is it about emotional value

330
0:12:26,64 --> 0:12:28,4
Buddy, I ask you

331
0:12:28,4 --> 0:12:29,48
I really admire you guys

332
0:12:29,48 --> 0:12:29,92
Generation Z

333
0:12:29,92 --> 0:12:31,68
The creativity of the Millennials

334
0:12:31,68 --> 0:12:34,18
the ability to search for information

335
0:12:34,18 --> 0:12:35,1
but to be honest

336
0:12:35,1 --> 0:12:35,88
you guys are not as resilient emotionally

337
0:12:35,88 --> 0:12:38,85
as the generation before us

338
0:12:38,85 --> 0:12:41,41
we've encountered so many of the worst things in this world

339
0:12:41,41 --> 0:12:43,1
things that are hard to even talk about

340
0:12:43,1 --> 0:12:44,69
sometimes they're just unspeakable

341
0:12:44,69 --> 0:12:46,569
our mortality rate is so high now

342
0:12:46,569 --> 0:12:48,209
to be honest, a lot of times

343
0:12:48,209 --> 0:12:51,209
The kind of Japanese-style education we experienced as children

344
0:12:51,209 --> 0:12:53,149
That corporal punishment

345
0:12:53,149 --> 0:12:56,6
Physical punishment was simply too much

346
0:12:56,6 --> 0:12:57,98
It's completely different from what kids experience now

347
0:12:57,98 --> 0:12:59,72
You can't hit or scold them now

348
0:12:59,72 --> 0:13:2,22
Actually, many of you can't be hit or scolded now

349
0:13:2,22 --> 0:13:5,35
You can't even say a single bad word

350
0:13:5,35 --> 0:13:7,45
If your emotional state collapses

351
0:13:7,45 --> 0:13:10,3
I'll go straight to Xiaohongshu

352
0:13:10,3 --> 0:13:11,59
You just straight up posted me on Tieba.

353
0:13:11,59 --> 0:13:12,7
Right?

354
0:13:12,7 --> 0:13:12,99
Girls post on Xiaohongshu,

355
0:13:12,99 --> 0:13:14,3
guys post on Tieba, right?

356
0:13:14,3 --> 0:13:15,3
Sun Xiaochuan was completely roasted.

357
0:13:15,3 --> 0:13:16,79
That's when we met.

358
0:13:16,79 --> 0:13:17,639
But does it actually work?

359
0:13:17,639 --> 0:13:18,299
Buddy,

360
0:13:18,299 --> 0:13:21,279
I'm asking you, is it useful for me to provide emotional support?

361
0:13:21,279 --> 0:13:23,11
Take a moment to think about it.

362
0:13:23,39 --> 0:13:25,19
When I said those things,

363
0:13:25,19 --> 0:13:26,43
To be honest,

364
0:13:26,43 --> 0:13:29,14
Actually, these two individuals,

365
0:13:29,14 --> 0:13:31,22
These two people I'm educating,

366
0:13:31,22 --> 0:13:33,88
They don't know I'm talking about them.

367
0:13:33,88 --> 0:13:36,16
I just let off some steam late at night.

368
0:13:36,16 --> 0:13:38,62
Their schedules are different from ours.

369
0:13:38,62 --> 0:13:40,599
They need their milk tea in the morning.

370
0:13:40,599 --> 0:13:43,99
I want to have a great emotional value.

371
0:13:43,99 --> 0:13:45,499
I want to watch an American drama at night, right?

372
0:13:45,499 --> 0:13:46,919
Watch a Japanese drama.

373
0:13:46,919 --> 0:13:48,84
Do something for myself.

374
0:13:48,84 --> 0:13:50,42
Make myself feel better.

375
0:13:50,42 --> 0:13:50,84
Right?

376
0:13:50,84 --> 0:13:52,8
First, I need to please myself.

377
0:13:52,8 --> 0:13:52,64
Right?

378
0:13:52,64 --> 0:13:53,98
Then browse Xiaohongshu for a bit.

379
0:13:53,98 --> 0:13:54,32
Ouch

380
0:13:54,32 --> 0:13:57,45
Let's check out what new cosmetics are on sale recently

381
0:13:57,45 --> 0:14:0,67
Let's see what new clothes are worth buying this season

382
0:14:0,87 --> 0:14:2,31
So in many cases

383
0:14:2,31 --> 0:14:3,9
Let me tell you

384
0:14:3,9 --> 0:14:6,5
If you, a girl, want to go for a masculine look

385
0:14:6,5 --> 0:14:7,35
you have to be even more

386
0:14:7,35 --> 0:14:10,18
The masculine route is incredibly cool

387
0:14:10,18 --> 0:14:11,9
Really, really cool

388
0:14:11,9 --> 0:14:13,46
When it comes to what men have,

389
0:14:13,46 --> 0:14:15,99
what they possess is a capacity to endure.

390
0:14:15,99 --> 0:14:17,95
A very focused kind of

391
0:14:17,95 --> 0:14:20,11
ability that isn't swayed by emotions.

392
0:14:20,11 --> 0:14:22,829
Women, on the other hand, are too easily trapped by their emotions.

393
0:14:22,829 --> 0:14:24,749
This can be quite detrimental.

394
0:14:24,749 --> 0:14:27,89
So, who nurtures your emotions?

395
0:14:27,89 --> 0:14:28,689
Who takes care of your feelings?

396
0:14:28,689 --> 0:14:31,789
The harder it is to soothe your emotions.

397
0:14:31,789 --> 0:14:34,49
Once someone has calmed you down

398
0:14:34,49 --> 0:14:37,15
and patted you on the back

399
0:14:37,15 --> 0:14:38,17
smoothed things over for you

400
0:14:38,17 --> 0:14:38,83
put you at ease

401
0:14:38,83 --> 0:14:39,89
you feel comfortable

402
0:14:39,89 --> 0:14:42,27
then they might take advantage of you

403
0:14:42,27 --> 0:14:43,71
it's that simple

404
0:14:43,71 --> 0:14:45,89
so don't let your emotions get the better of you

405
0:14:45,89 --> 0:14:48,67
even if you're in turmoil inside

406
0:14:48,67 --> 0:14:49,89
Don't let it show

407
0:14:49,89 --> 0:14:51,3
Look at those strong female leads

408
0:14:51,3 --> 0:14:52,77
Those real-life female CEOs

409
0:14:52,77 --> 0:14:55,79
How many of them casually exhale towards someone's nose?

410
0:14:55,79 --> 0:14:56,9
Not many

411
0:14:56,9 --> 0:14:58,52
When you take care of someone's feelings

412
0:14:58,52 --> 0:15:0,62
When you let your boyfriend cater to your emotions

413
0:15:0,62 --> 0:15:2,37
That's actually the worst time

414
0:15:2,37 --> 0:15:5,29
That's when you're giving away your power

415
0:15:5,29 --> 0:15:6,69
A man should focus on his career.

416
0:15:6,69 --> 0:15:8,55
A man should provide financial support.

417
0:15:8,55 --> 0:15:10,67
A man should offer emotional support.

418
0:15:10,67 --> 0:15:11,47
Now, let me ask you something.

419
0:15:11,47 --> 0:15:14,37
If your husband constantly provides you with emotional support,

420
0:15:14,37 --> 0:15:16,36
how weak would you have to be?

421
0:15:16,36 --> 0:15:17,92
Look at all those examples.

422
0:15:17,92 --> 0:15:19,86
My husband brings me toilet paper.

423
0:15:19,86 --> 0:15:21,32
I’m thirsty, honey.

424
0:15:21,32 --> 0:15:23,319
Honey, I want to eat something.

425
0:15:23,319 --> 0:15:25,959
How weak are those people?

426
0:15:25,959 --> 0:15:26,88
I'm asking you.

427
0:15:26,88 --> 0:15:28,7
Is this the life you want?

428
0:15:28,7 --> 0:15:30,88
Is this the life an independent woman like you wants?

429
0:15:30,88 --> 0:15:33,31
I'm asking you, it's the same for guys, right?

430
0:15:33,31 --> 0:15:35,61
You always think girls need to rely on me, don't you?

431
0:15:35,61 --> 0:15:36,79
What do you think girls should be like?

432
0:15:36,79 --> 0:15:38,94
What do you have to complain about?

433
0:15:38,94 --> 0:15:40,26
You're Claude, aren't you?

434
0:15:40,26 --> 0:15:42,28
You're Tifa's boyfriend, huh?

435
0:15:42,28 --> 0:15:45,53
What do you have, Claude?

436
0:15:45,53 --> 0:15:48,31
Is Double Guan Yu playing with words?

437
0:15:48,31 --> 0:15:50,54
What do you have to talk about?

438
0:15:50,9 --> 0:15:51,88
You have a car.

439
0:15:51,88 --> 0:15:52,78
You have a house.

440
0:15:52,78 --> 0:15:54,2
You have cash flow.

441
0:15:54,2 --> 0:15:54,94
You have a career.

442
0:15:54,94 --> 0:15:56,16
You have shares

443
0:15:56,16 --> 0:15:57,82
You've got style

444
0:15:57,82 --> 0:15:59,7
Or are you 18 centimeters tall

445
0:15:59,7 --> 0:16:2,64
What do you have that's worth salvaging

446
0:16:2,64 --> 0:16:5,9
Why are you so mutually hateful

447
0:16:5,9 --> 0:16:7,68
Why are the emotions so opposed

448
0:16:7,68 --> 0:16:8,81
Gender opposition

449
0:16:8,81 --> 0:16:10,81
Aren't they just low-level men

450
0:16:10,81 --> 0:16:12,85
Low-level women opposing each other

451
0:16:12,85 --> 0:16:15,17
Someone who is a bit more good-looking

452
0:16:15,17 --> 0:16:17,47
Who’s stirring up conflict?

453
0:16:17,47 --> 0:16:19,47
Think about it carefully

454
0:16:19,47 --> 0:16:22,3
Can you blame others?

455
0:16:22,4 --> 0:16:23,96
Think about it carefully

456
0:16:23,96 --> 0:16:25,8
I take care of your emotions every day

457
0:16:25,8 --> 0:16:27,55
How exhausted I am

458
0:16:27,95 --> 0:16:29,47
Think about it carefully

459
0:16:29,47 --> 0:16:33,65
Actually, I’m just as tired of foolishness as everyone else

460
0:16:33,65 --> 0:16:34,97
There's no difference

461
0:16:34,97 --> 0:16:37,3
What can truly change you

462
0:16:37,3 --> 0:16:37,75
The sky is strong

463
0:16:37,75 --> 0:16:39,48
A gentleman should exert himself constantly

464
0:16:39,48 --> 0:16:41,28
Is it about rising from a peasant in the morning

465
0:16:41,28 --> 0:16:42,579
To standing before the emperor by night

466
0:16:42,579 --> 0:16:44,899
You need to have a heroic spirit

467
0:16:44,899 --> 0:16:46,299
It needs to be in your body

468
0:16:46,299 --> 0:16:47,539
It needs to be in your heart

469
0:16:47,539 --> 0:16:50,319
It has to be a flame that never goes out

470
0:16:50,319 --> 0:16:52,339
Otherwise, you’re nothing

471
0:16:52,339 --> 0:16:53,839
Taking care of emotions every day

472
0:16:53,839 --> 0:16:57,7
If a girl’s emotions are taken care of every day, that’s one thing

473
0:16:57,7 --> 0:16:59,22
A girl’s bad mood needs to be soothed

474
0:16:59,22 --> 0:17:1,62
You’re a man, a real man

475
0:17:1,62 --> 0:17:2,3
A tough guy

476
0:17:2,3 --> 0:17:3,9
Why should you be the one to take care of emotions?

477
0:17:3,9 --> 0:17:6,22
Look at the delicate men nowadays

478
0:17:6,22 --> 0:17:8,76
All kinds of people directly dress up as male idols

479
0:17:8,76 --> 0:17:11,1
Of course, I really like male idols

480
0:17:11,1 --> 0:17:14,65
But is that what a real man should be like?

481
0:17:14,65 --> 0:17:18,49
Well, I ask you, if a man doesn't even have masculinity,

482
0:17:18,49 --> 0:17:19,51
How can he protect his country and family?

483
0:17:19,51 --> 0:17:21,1
I ask you,

484
0:17:21,1 --> 0:17:23,31
You'd better join the military,

485
0:17:23,31 --> 0:17:24,43
Go and get some training,

486
0:17:24,43 --> 0:17:26,52
Especially to strengthen your willpower and character

487
0:17:26,52 --> 0:17:28,0
Many people say, to be honest

488
0:17:28,0 --> 0:17:30,78
we are now being greatly pampered by the internet

489
0:17:30,78 --> 0:17:33,11
entertainment to the death

490
0:17:33,11 --> 0:17:34,55
everything is just what it is

491
0:17:34,55 --> 0:17:37,639
it seems like if you hear about a way to make money tomorrow

492
0:17:37,639 --> 0:17:39,219
you could get a handle on it

493
0:17:39,219 --> 0:17:41,79
there are many ways to make money in this world

494
0:17:41,79 --> 0:17:43,38
the question is, are you the right fit for it?

495
0:17:43,58 --> 0:17:45,84
can you take the hit?

496
0:17:45,84 --> 0:17:48,26
Can you handle that?

497
0:17:48,26 --> 0:17:50,55
You're not that kind of person.

498
0:17:50,95 --> 0:17:52,11
Even if I gave you the opportunity,

499
0:17:52,11 --> 0:17:53,9
you wouldn't take it.

500
0:17:53,9 --> 0:17:55,21
You don't have the guts.

501
0:17:55,21 --> 0:17:57,1
So in this world,

502
0:17:57,1 --> 0:17:59,25
what truly needs to be honed is your willpower.

503
0:17:59,25 --> 0:18:2,23
Your willpower is crucial.

504
0:18:2,23 --> 0:18:3,87
What the military teaches you is

505
0:18:3,87 --> 0:18:5,37
It's about your willpower and character strength

506
0:18:5,37 --> 0:18:7,5
Of course, it also trains your physical fitness

507
0:18:7,5 --> 0:18:8,31
But more importantly

508
0:18:8,31 --> 0:18:9,19
You're not afraid of hardship

509
0:18:9,19 --> 0:18:10,699
And you're not afraid of death

510
0:18:10,699 --> 0:18:11,959
A fearless revolutionary spirit

511
0:18:11,959 --> 0:18:12,859
A fearless spirit

512
0:18:12,859 --> 0:18:14,239
This is crucial

513
0:18:14,239 --> 0:18:16,909
Fearlessness in the face of death is crucial

514
0:18:16,909 --> 0:18:19,69
So, let's talk about the boys later.

515
0:18:19,69 --> 0:18:19,569
And the girls.

516
0:18:19,569 --> 0:18:21,289
What do you mean, you're my followers?

517
0:18:21,289 --> 0:18:23,69
I really take care of your feelings.

518
0:18:23,69 --> 0:18:25,57
But you know you have to be strong.

519
0:18:25,57 --> 0:18:27,95
You must be confident and strong.

520
0:18:27,95 --> 0:18:29,59
Love and respect yourselves.

521
0:18:29,59 --> 0:18:32,29
But we can do without that pride.

522
0:18:32,29 --> 0:18:34,87
We can humble ourselves to learn.

523
0:18:34,87 --> 0:18:36,719
To acquire a skill

524
0:18:36,719 --> 0:18:39,59
it’s fine to practice obsessively

525
0:18:39,59 --> 0:18:41,84
because in this world, use it or lose it

526
0:18:41,84 --> 0:18:44,9
there’s no one who truly cares about your feelings

527
0:18:44,9 --> 0:18:47,389
but algorithms will cater to all your preferences

528
0:18:47,389 --> 0:18:49,429
if you want to improve

529
0:18:49,429 --> 0:18:50,469
take advantage of opportunities as they come

530
0:18:50,469 --> 0:18:53,13
it’s bound to be a painful process

531
0:18:53,13 --> 0:18:54,27
if you want to make money

532
0:18:54,27 --> 0:18:56,21
That’s absolutely against nature.

533
0:18:56,21 --> 0:18:57,41
You want to leap to the end.

534
0:18:57,41 --> 0:18:59,29
That’s a once-in-a-lifetime event.

535
0:18:59,29 --> 0:19:2,27
What kind of world will you be facing?

536
0:19:2,27 --> 0:19:5,69
What kind of terrifying future will you be facing?

537
0:19:5,69 --> 0:19:9,61
I can’t even imagine the era I lived in.

538
0:19:9,61 --> 0:19:12,31
Competition was relatively less intense compared to what you face now.

539
0:19:12,31 --> 0:19:15,85
You are now facing several major technological challenges.

540
0:19:15,85 --> 0:19:19,21
There’s only one possibility: to replace human work.

541
0:19:19,21 --> 0:19:22,29
Your job market is far more competitive than in our time.

542
0:19:22,29 --> 0:19:23,49
Compared to when we were young.

543
0:19:23,49 --> 0:19:26,13
It's on a completely different scale.

544
0:19:26,13 --> 0:19:27,25
I can't even imagine.

545
0:19:27,25 --> 0:19:29,31
What it would be like if I were a young person today.

546
0:19:29,31 --> 0:19:30,61
How I would make a living.

547
0:19:30,61 --> 0:19:31,96
I have no idea.

548
0:19:32,16 --> 0:19:34,3
Because I just don't know.

549
0:19:34,3 --> 0:19:37,33
Back then, it wasn't as challenging.

550
0:19:38,1 --> 0:19:38,81
I'm not really tall

551
0:19:40,13 --> 0:19:42,199
This is 20 years later

552
0:19:42,399 --> 0:19:45,739
When I was 21, I wasn't as anxious as you guys are now

553
0:19:45,739 --> 0:19:47,699
It wasn't as hard to find a job

554
0:19:47,699 --> 0:19:48,539
I don't know

555
0:19:48,539 --> 0:19:51,239
If you're not putting in 120% effort now

556
0:19:51,239 --> 0:19:53,29
How will you face the world in the future?

557
0:19:53,29 --> 0:19:55,37
So I'm actually quite anxious now

558
0:19:55,37 --> 0:19:56,5
Very nervous

559
0:19:56,5 --> 0:19:57,97
I'm very happy

560
0:19:57,97 --> 0:20:1,11
I still have a bit of money

561
0:20:1,11 --> 0:20:3,59
I still have some assets of my own

562
0:20:3,59 --> 0:20:5,49
I still have some passive income

563
0:20:5,49 --> 0:20:8,93
Enough to keep me from bowing for a bowl of rice

564
0:20:8,93 --> 0:20:10,29
Otherwise, I'd be driving a ride-hailing car

565
0:20:10,29 --> 0:20:13,3
Or delivering food, which is quite common

566
0:20:13,3 --> 0:20:14,81
Just like millions of others

567
0:20:14,81 --> 0:20:15,39
I don't know

568
0:20:15,39 --> 0:20:16,51
If I were like that

569
0:20:16,51 --> 0:20:17,67
What would I do?

570
0:20:17,67 --> 0:20:20,86
Because I don't want to face this era

571
0:20:21,14 --> 0:20:23,5
So you must train your willpower

572
0:20:23,5 --> 0:20:24,18
Your character

573
0:20:24,18 --> 0:20:25,97
You need to harness your energy

574
0:20:25,97 --> 0:20:27,41
You need to strengthen your willpower

575
0:20:27,41 --> 0:20:30,47
You need to push your abilities to the limit

576
0:20:30,47 --> 0:20:32,47
You have to work your ass off

577
0:20:32,47 --> 0:20:34,55
I worked really hard when I was young

578
0:20:34,55 --> 0:20:35,85
I was very dedicated

579
0:20:35,85 --> 0:20:38,77
But if you always look at the internet for

580
0:20:38,77 --> 0:20:40,11
These negative things

581
0:20:40,11 --> 0:20:41,93
Things that calm your emotions

582
0:20:41,93 --> 0:20:44,8
You'll end up achieving nothing

583
0:20:44,8 --> 0:20:46,8
So sometimes, harsh advice is the best advice

584
0:20:46,8 --> 0:20:49,36
Cyber Godfather might comfort you sometimes

585
0:20:49,36 --> 0:20:50,88
And sometimes push you

586
0:20:50,88 --> 0:20:52,16
You need to be scolded

587
0:20:52,16 --> 0:20:53,9
You need to hear these things

588
0:20:53,9 --> 0:20:56,0
You need to confront your weaknesses

589
0:20:56,0 --> 0:20:59,6
You need to face the cowardice in your soul

590
0:20:59,6 --> 0:21:1,4
Those things that you use or lose

591
0:21:1,4 --> 0:21:3,9
You must have a very strong competitive spirit

592
0:21:3,9 --> 0:21:6,26
I'm not telling you to compete for a civil service position

593
0:21:6,26 --> 0:21:7,6
I'm not telling you to compete for a postgraduate spot

594
0:21:7,6 --> 0:21:9,469
I'm telling you to compete in your career

595
0:21:9,469 --> 0:21:11,549
I want you to compete in your basic skills

596
0:21:11,549 --> 0:21:12,629
In your will and character

597
0:21:12,629 --> 0:21:14,98
You can't give up easily

598
0:21:14,98 --> 0:21:17,8
You can't quit easily

599
0:21:17,8 --> 0:21:20,2
You can't admit defeat before you've fully explored your potential

600
0:21:20,2 --> 0:21:22,17
And feel satisfied with yourself

601
0:21:22,17 --> 0:21:24,9
Feeling quite pleased with yourself

602
0:21:24,9 --> 0:21:26,1
Taking a few photos here and there

603
0:21:26,1 --> 0:21:27,59
Posting two videos today

604
0:21:27,59 --> 0:21:29,15
One tomorrow

605
0:21:29,15 --> 0:21:30,25
None the third day

606
0:21:30,25 --> 0:21:31,95
Doing live streams only when you feel like it

607
0:21:31,95 --> 0:21:34,1
That's just not acceptable

608
0:21:34,1 --> 0:21:35,37
That's just not acceptable

609
0:21:36,41 --> 0:21:37,47
You might be completely

610
0:21:37,47 --> 0:21:38,95
Relying on these skills for the next few decades

611
0:21:38,95 --> 0:21:42,32
Many people will only be able to rely on social media

612
0:21:42,32 --> 0:21:44,92
As their sole source of income

613
0:21:44,92 --> 0:21:46,88
What will you do then?

614
0:21:46,88 --> 0:21:48,16
You need to practice well

615
0:21:48,16 --> 0:21:50,4
Because not being able to make a living is terrifying

616
0:21:50,4 --> 0:21:53,94
You can lie flat

617
0:21:53,94 --> 0:21:55,64
But are you content with that?

618
0:21:55,64 --> 0:21:57,58
Aren't you discontent?

619
0:21:57,58 --> 0:21:59,26
You're not willing to give up
