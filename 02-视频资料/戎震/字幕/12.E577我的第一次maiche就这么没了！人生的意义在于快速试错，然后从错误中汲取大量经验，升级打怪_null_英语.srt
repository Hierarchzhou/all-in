1
0:0:0,64 --> 0:0:4,68
Life only moves forward through constant trial and error.

2
0:0:4,68 --> 0:0:6,96
That's the meaning of our existence.

3
0:0:6,96 --> 0:0:8,62
Hey, I bought a car.

4
0:0:8,62 --> 0:0:10,38
But I regret it.

5
0:0:10,38 --> 0:0:13,78
I bought such a small car with this range.

6
0:0:13,78 --> 0:0:17,669
I used to think I could get a BYD Qin L.

7
0:0:17,669 --> 0:0:21,6
Is this range from a hybrid system?

8
0:0:21,6 --> 0:0:22,44
Is this called an extended-range or a hybrid?

9
0:0:22,44 --> 0:0:23,24
I don't really know either.

10
0:0:23,24 --> 0:0:27,43
It has a range of over 2200km, which is great.

11
0:0:27,99 --> 0:0:31,69
But later, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that

12
0:0:31,69 --> 0:0:32,83
in Beijing,

13
0:0:32,83 --> 0:0:37,83
only pure electric vehicles are considered new energy vehicles here.

14
0:0:37,83 --> 0:0:40,1
I'm not sure how it works in other provinces and cities.

15
0:0:40,1 --> 0:0:45,63
but the probability of winning a regular fuel car license plate in Beijing is

16
0:0:45,63 --> 0:0:48,4
only 0.1%. 

17
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:51,18
Everyone knows that using condoms

18
0:0:51,18 --> 0:0:53,96
still leaves a 3% chance of pregnancy.

19
0:0:53,96 --> 0:1:0,98
That means the probability of unexpectedly becoming a father is 30 times higher than winning the Beijing license plate lottery.

20
0:1:0,98 --> 0:1:3,319
It's such a magical process.

21
0:1:3,319 --> 0:1:7,879
I've been on the waiting list for a family license plate for 5 years.

22
0:1:9,159 --> 0:1:11,13
Finally, I got a new energy vehicle license plate.

23
0:1:11,13 --> 0:1:14,25
And I was lucky enough to win the draw on May 28th this year.

24
0:1:14,25 --> 0:1:15,93
That's how it went.

25
0:1:15,93 --> 0:1:19,23
Actually, I could have bought a car next year, around the Spring Festival.

26
0:1:19,23 --> 0:1:20,83
My parents and I had already discussed it.

27
0:1:20,83 --> 0:1:21,71
We planned to buy the car next Spring Festival.

28
0:1:21,71 --> 0:1:24,38
Next Spring Festival, if I buy a car, I definitely won't buy it from a gold shop.

29
0:1:24,38 --> 0:1:25,88
But I ended up buying a motorcycle.

30
0:1:25,88 --> 0:1:27,2
I was really excited.

31
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:29,819
I think buying a motorcycle is a pretty good idea.

32
0:1:29,819 --> 0:1:31,599
So, I decided to go ahead and buy a car as well.

33
0:1:31,599 --> 0:1:34,48
And the Geely Panda Knight is just perfect.

34
0:1:34,48 --> 0:1:36,4
The 210km range is really great.

35
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:38,36
During the drive back today,

36
0:1:38,36 --> 0:1:41,12
I noticed something interesting about the drive.

37
0:1:41,12 --> 0:1:43,22
This is at least 40 kilometers, right?

38
0:1:43,22 --> 0:1:45,42
Hehe, but we're not dissing the car.

39
0:1:45,42 --> 0:1:46,8
I have the air conditioning set pretty high.

40
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:48,46
Because it's particularly hot today.

41
0:1:48,46 --> 0:1:51,1
So, the range has dropped by 70 kilometers.

42
0:1:51,1 --> 0:1:52,12
It's down by 37%.

43
0:1:52,12 --> 0:1:53,729
There's still 63% left.

44
0:1:53,729 --> 0:1:55,49
It was fully charged when we started.

45
0:1:55,49 --> 0:1:56,309
And now it's dropped by 37%.

46
0:1:56,309 --> 0:1:57,429
It really breaks my heart

47
0:1:57,429 --> 0:1:59,63
I mean, during the summer

48
0:1:59,63 --> 0:2:2,39
the actual range of this car

49
0:2:2,39 --> 0:2:5,86
is probably between 135km and 149km

50
0:2:5,86 --> 0:2:13,4
and the car kindly reminds us that using the heater in winter will significantly increase energy consumption

51
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:16,94
which means the energy consumption can reach 30%

52
0:2:16,94 --> 0:2:18,329
it’s only 10% in the summer

53
0:2:18,329 --> 0:2:20,9
so we need to factor that in

54
0:2:20,9 --> 0:2:23,889
so I think the range will drop a bit more in winter

55
0:2:23,889 --> 0:2:26,26
This is the downside of small batteries.

56
0:2:26,26 --> 0:2:28,5
But there is an upside, though.

57
0:2:28,5 --> 0:2:30,9
Because now we can understand the rankings on CarDi.

58
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:33,57
This Beijing Geely's Xinyuan model,

59
0:2:33,57 --> 0:2:35,25
the Xinyuan car,

60
0:2:35,25 --> 0:2:37,83
if I use my car, how much of its value would it be worth?

61
0:2:37,83 --> 0:2:40,73
since they all fall under the Geely Galaxy and Geely Geometry series.

62
0:2:40,73 --> 0:2:41,709
Right?

63
0:2:41,709 --> 0:2:43,349
from the same manufacturer.

64
0:2:43,349 --> 0:2:44,629
If you buy it again,

65
0:2:44,629 --> 0:2:45,669
it would be cheaper, wouldn't it?

66
0:2:45,669 --> 0:2:47,609
You might even save two or three thousand dollars.

67
0:2:47,609 --> 0:2:52,11
So, it’s a bit of a catch-22 now.

68
0:2:52,11 --> 0:2:53,7
The car has already been bought,

69
0:2:53,7 --> 0:2:53,51
right?

70
0:2:53,51 --> 0:2:56,59
It has already cost 33,600 dollars.

71
0:2:56,59 --> 0:2:57,99
The insurance is also sorted out,

72
0:2:57,99 --> 0:2:58,259
and the plates are registered.

73
0:2:58,259 --> 0:2:59,48
I've also arrived home.

74
0:2:59,48 --> 0:3:1,4
The parking fee is paid too.

75
0:3:1,4 --> 0:3:2,8
All the way until June 30th next year.

76
0:3:2,8 --> 0:3:5,34
I'm currently parked at this place.

77
0:3:5,34 --> 0:3:6,6
Just parked by the roadside.

78
0:3:6,6 --> 0:3:7,52
If you happen to pass by,

79
0:3:7,52 --> 0:3:8,93
you can take a group photo.

80
0:3:10,21 --> 0:3:12,23
Now I'm in a bit of a dilemma.

81
0:3:12,23 --> 0:3:14,17
You're talking about over 100 kilometers.

82
0:3:14,17 --> 0:3:18,46
What's the difference between this and my electric scooter number 9?

83
0:3:18,46 --> 0:3:20,4
My number 9 isn’t even lithium-powered.

84
0:3:20,4 --> 0:3:21,16
It’s still using a lead-acid battery.

85
0:3:21,16 --> 0:3:23,0
This one with the lead-acid battery.

86
0:3:23,0 --> 0:3:24,9
Since it’s the mz mix, you know.

87
0:3:24,9 --> 0:3:26,22
It’s the same, yeah.

88
0:3:26,22 --> 0:3:27,32
It goes further in the summer.

89
0:3:27,32 --> 0:3:29,28
But in winter, the range is shorter.

90
0:3:29,28 --> 0:3:32,54
Plus, there’s also the issue of air conditioning in cars.

91
0:3:32,54 --> 0:3:35,1
So it's basically turned into a practice car.

92
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:37,9
It doesn't even serve as a reliable mode of transportation.

93
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:39,21
But I mentioned,

94
0:3:39,21 --> 0:3:41,33
this is just a number-holding car.

95
0:3:41,33 --> 0:3:43,49
It's quite normal for a number-holding car.

96
0:3:43,49 --> 0:3:46,5
I use this car to hold onto the number.

97
0:3:46,5 --> 0:3:48,0
Because every time you sell a car,

98
0:3:48,0 --> 0:3:51,18
the validity period of this quota gets extended.

99
0:3:51,18 --> 0:3:53,12
It becomes 12 months again.

100
0:3:53,12 --> 0:3:54,399
Sell this car.

101
0:3:54,399 --> 0:3:56,879
Then you’ll have 12 months without needing to buy a new one.

102
0:3:56,879 --> 0:3:58,39
But you always get stuck.

103
0:3:58,39 --> 0:3:59,399
Those 12 months could be inconvenient.

104
0:3:59,399 --> 0:4:1,56
I’m worried that next year,

105
0:4:1,56 --> 0:4:1,92
right?

106
0:4:1,92 --> 0:4:3,86
if I suddenly need to go on an international trip,

107
0:4:3,86 --> 0:4:5,209
for three or four months,

108
0:4:5,209 --> 0:4:7,169
I can’t let the quota issue hold me back.

109
0:4:7,169 --> 0:4:8,849
I’ll come back for the car thing.

110
0:4:8,849 --> 0:4:9,669
Right?

111
0:4:9,669 --> 0:4:11,589
The round-trip ticket costs over ten thousand yuan.

112
0:4:11,589 --> 0:4:14,53
So, I guess I bought it in advance.

113
0:4:14,53 --> 0:4:15,73
Just got the discomfort early.

114
0:4:15,73 --> 0:4:17,25
So, the more you have,

115
0:4:17,25 --> 0:4:18,7
the more you suffer.

116
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:20,14
But let’s talk about it.

117
0:4:20,5 --> 0:4:23,26
Life is all about experiences.

118
0:4:23,26 --> 0:4:25,52
You need to try and fail quickly

119
0:4:25,52 --> 0:4:27,21
You have to experiment and make mistakes

120
0:4:27,21 --> 0:4:29,93
Only then will you know if your choices are right

121
0:4:29,93 --> 0:4:30,77
To reiterate

122
0:4:30,77 --> 0:4:32,72
Don’t punish your past self

123
0:4:32,72 --> 0:4:34,48
In the time frame of your past

124
0:4:34,48 --> 0:4:36,69
What you did seemed right at the time

125
0:4:36,69 --> 0:4:38,25
Because my goal is to secure a parking spot

126
0:4:38,25 --> 0:4:40,81
My aim is to spend as little money as possible

127
0:4:40,81 --> 0:4:42,35
This car actually has fast charging.

128
0:4:42,35 --> 0:4:43,39
If it didn’t have fast charging,

129
0:4:43,39 --> 0:4:45,56
I’d definitely still go for the high-end BYD Seagull.

130
0:4:45,56 --> 0:4:47,68
Of course, whether it’s 300km or 400km,

131
0:4:47,68 --> 0:4:50,56
My initial choice was the high-spec BYD Seagull,

132
0:4:50,56 --> 0:4:52,83
The high-spec BYD Dolphin,

133
0:4:52,83 --> 0:4:54,23
They all have ranges of 400 to 500 kilometers,

134
0:4:54,23 --> 0:4:55,47
Because I think there will be some loss,

135
0:4:55,47 --> 0:4:57,19
But you can actually get a car like this.

136
0:4:57,19 --> 0:4:59,81
This car only takes up half a parking space.

137
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:1,23
It's a very easy-to-drive small car.

138
0:5:1,23 --> 0:5:5,51
But to be honest, it's more suitable for smaller cities and towns.

139
0:5:5,51 --> 0:5:7,21
It's particularly fitting for small counties.

140
0:5:7,21 --> 0:5:8,93
The road conditions aren't complicated either.

141
0:5:8,93 --> 0:5:10,95
But the car does have great power.

142
0:5:10,95 --> 0:5:14,9
The Wuling Hongguang Mini now also has fast charging.

143
0:5:14,9 --> 0:5:19,18
So this Wuling Hongguang Mini and the Geely Geometry Panda Knight Panda kart.

144
0:5:19,18 --> 0:5:20,64
Actually, they can also be recommended to you.

145
0:5:20,64 --> 0:5:22,14
But still, the same thing

146
0:5:22,14 --> 0:5:23,48
Big cities aren't suitable

147
0:5:23,48 --> 0:5:26,44
Hehe, in big cities, you're always traveling tens of kilometers

148
0:5:26,44 --> 0:5:27,56
If you're in Beijing

149
0:5:27,56 --> 0:5:28,72
It's often over 30 kilometers

150
0:5:28,72 --> 0:5:29,84
Or even 40 kilometers

151
0:5:29,84 --> 0:5:31,88
You have to recharge every time you go out

152
0:5:31,88 --> 0:5:32,64
That's quite a hassle

153
0:5:32,64 --> 0:5:34,58
So it's become my practice car

154
0:5:34,58 --> 0:5:35,84
So, to be honest,

155
0:5:35,84 --> 0:5:36,799
I have nothing better to do,

156
0:5:36,799 --> 0:5:39,599
I wouldn’t drive more than a few laps, maybe seven or eight,

157
0:5:39,599 --> 0:5:40,639
which is about 78 kilometers,

158
0:5:40,639 --> 0:5:41,459
or a dozen kilometers,

159
0:5:41,459 --> 0:5:43,29
I wouldn’t drive too far, you know,

160
0:5:43,29 --> 0:5:47,13
so this has become my practice car,

161
0:5:47,41 --> 0:5:48,69
Let’s add one more thing,

162
0:5:48,69 --> 0:5:51,31
all the things in life

163
0:5:51,31 --> 0:5:54,2
Actually, you can see why you play games the same way.

164
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:55,82
Look, I'm playing zombies now.

165
0:5:55,82 --> 0:5:58,109
The Last Stand is just for fun.

166
0:5:58,109 --> 0:6:0,889
I've probably completed it about ten times.

167
0:6:0,889 --> 0:6:2,609
But in reality, I play on easy mode.

168
0:6:2,609 --> 0:6:3,589
Sandbox mode.

169
0:6:3,589 --> 0:6:6,22
Adjusted the difficulty so food doesn't spoil.

170
0:6:6,22 --> 0:6:6,9
There's an abundance of it.

171
0:6:6,9 --> 0:6:8,4
A ton of weapons too.

172
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:9,18
So I just play for the fun of it

173
0:6:9,18 --> 0:6:10,8
I always cheat when I play games

174
0:6:10,8 --> 0:6:13,35
Cheating allows me to play at the lowest difficulty

175
0:6:13,35 --> 0:6:13,99
I always do it this way

176
0:6:13,99 --> 0:6:15,47
As long as I have a good time

177
0:6:15,47 --> 0:6:17,289
Don't challenge yourself

178
0:6:17,289 --> 0:6:19,369
But this game is just like that

179
0:6:19,369 --> 0:6:21,669
Take the Total War series for example

180
0:6:21,669 --> 0:6:22,929
Every time you lose

181
0:6:22,929 --> 0:6:26,32
Every time you make a mistake moving forward

182
0:6:26,32 --> 0:6:28,96
your growth rate will accelerate

183
0:6:28,96 --> 0:6:31,97
like learning a language, each mistake you make

184
0:6:31,97 --> 0:6:33,75
stumbling once

185
0:6:33,75 --> 0:6:34,75
helps you move faster

186
0:6:34,75 --> 0:6:39,12
so humans constantly learn and progress through mistakes

187
0:6:39,12 --> 0:6:40,78
you can't be afraid of making mistakes

188
0:6:40,78 --> 0:6:42,26
if you fear making mistakes

189
0:6:42,26 --> 0:6:43,56
you have a tendency to make them

190
0:6:43,56 --> 0:6:44,62
It's easy not to start

191
0:6:44,62 --> 0:6:45,58
It's easy to procrastinate

192
0:6:45,58 --> 0:6:46,26
Did you know?

193
0:6:46,26 --> 0:6:50,15
But once you start doing something, as long as you get started

194
0:6:50,15 --> 0:6:51,53
Even if it's not perfect

195
0:6:51,53 --> 0:6:53,3
As long as you begin, that's what matters

196
0:6:53,3 --> 0:6:55,36
Just like I force myself to get on the road

197
0:6:55,36 --> 0:6:56,98
I dare to ride my motorcycle on the road

198
0:6:56,98 --> 0:6:59,2
But I can also ride an electric scooter

199
0:6:59,2 --> 0:7:1,17
I'm really a bit hesitant to drive a car on the road.

200
0:7:1,17 --> 0:7:5,41
Because the accident video from the fourth subject exam really gave me a scare.

201
0:7:5,41 --> 0:7:9,93
And I always think that with every press of the pedal, it could be someone's life at stake.

202
0:7:9,93 --> 0:7:10,89
Someone else's child,

203
0:7:10,89 --> 0:7:13,22
an elderly person's life is in my hands.

204
0:7:13,22 --> 0:7:15,14
So I can't afford to be relaxed at all.

205
0:7:15,14 --> 0:7:16,74
I absolutely can't overlook these things.

206
0:7:16,74 --> 0:7:18,62
That's why I take a lot of responsibility for it.

207
0:7:18,62 --> 0:7:19,549
I get really nervous.

208
0:7:19,549 --> 0:7:23,449
I think this thing is just a tear for every driver

209
0:7:23,449 --> 0:7:24,969
like family members sharing a toast

210
0:7:24,969 --> 0:7:27,349
it's just something that can't happen to me

211
0:7:27,349 --> 0:7:29,829
so I'm extremely nervous

212
0:7:29,829 --> 0:7:33,5
I was planning to be quite preoccupied today

213
0:7:33,5 --> 0:7:35,13
intending to drive back 30km

214
0:7:35,13 --> 0:7:36,77
but there was a truck in the middle

215
0:7:36,77 --> 0:7:37,69
it suddenly slammed on the brakes

216
0:7:37,69 --> 0:7:39,1
which made me have to brake hard too

217
0:7:39,1 --> 0:7:40,25
A sudden brake

218
0:7:40,25 --> 0:7:43,45
My water bottle flew from the back seat to the front

219
0:7:43,45 --> 0:7:45,35
It made me super nervous

220
0:7:45,35 --> 0:7:47,51
I thought, this is just from a quick brake

221
0:7:47,51 --> 0:7:48,39
Either I would hit someone from behind

222
0:7:48,39 --> 0:7:49,31
Or someone would hit me from behind

223
0:7:49,31 --> 0:7:50,63
What a terrifying situation

224
0:7:50,63 --> 0:7:52,31
So I thought, oh well, forget it

225
0:7:52,31 --> 0:7:53,35
I’ll just call a driver

226
0:7:53,35 --> 0:7:56,37
I drove about 56 kilometers

227
0:7:56,37 --> 0:7:59,23
before I found a place to park and dared to call a driver

228
0:7:59,23 --> 0:8:0,35
and then drove back

229
0:8:0,35 --> 0:8:2,66
all the way back to my starting point

230
0:8:2,66 --> 0:8:4,34
there was a sharp turn in the middle

231
0:8:4,34 --> 0:8:9,199
and my water bottle got thrown under the brake and accelerator pedals

232
0:8:9,199 --> 0:8:10,859
fortunately, it got stuck under the accelerator

233
0:8:10,859 --> 0:8:11,899
it didn’t get stuck under the brake

234
0:8:11,899 --> 0:8:12,979
if it had gotten stuck under the brake

235
0:8:12,979 --> 0:8:14,78
So I had to use the handbrake to stop the car.

236
0:8:14,78 --> 0:8:15,62
How dangerous that was.

237
0:8:15,62 --> 0:8:17,74
That's what I had anticipated.

238
0:8:17,74 --> 0:8:19,74
For example, my car needs an additional installation.

239
0:8:19,74 --> 0:8:21,22
A partition in the middle.

240
0:8:21,22 --> 0:8:23,8
And the water can't be placed in the front passenger seat.

241
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:25,38
It must be placed in the back.

242
0:8:25,38 --> 0:8:26,78
Or in the cup holder.

243
0:8:26,78 --> 0:8:27,68
That's much safer.

244
0:8:27,68 --> 0:8:32,34
Nothing should reach under this brake pedal.

245
0:8:32,34 --> 0:8:33,77
That's extremely dangerous.

246
0:8:33,77 --> 0:8:37,53
And I will absolutely never drive in flip-flops again.

247
0:8:37,53 --> 0:8:39,9
When riding a motorcycle or similar.

248
0:8:39,9 --> 0:8:40,589
You need to wear protective gear.

249
0:8:40,589 --> 0:8:41,989
It's not enough to just have insurance.

250
0:8:41,989 --> 0:8:42,909
You also need to wear protective gear.

251
0:8:42,909 --> 0:8:43,769
Wear a helmet.

252
0:8:43,769 --> 0:8:45,46
I always wear my helmet.

253
0:8:45,46 --> 0:8:47,8
But I bought this protective gear and never wore it.

254
0:8:47,8 --> 0:8:49,86
For people like those who offer riding services,

255
0:8:49,86 --> 0:8:50,82
You're just riding a scooter.

256
0:8:50,82 --> 0:8:51,71
Is it really necessary?

257
0:8:51,71 --> 0:8:54,71
I should at least wear proper hiking shoes,

258
0:8:54,71 --> 0:8:55,63
Or sports shoes.

259
0:8:55,63 --> 0:8:59,71
Instead of wearing those flip-flops all the time.

260
0:8:59,71 --> 0:9:2,73
So when you think about my entrepreneurial journey,

261
0:9:2,73 --> 0:9:4,69
To be honest,

262
0:9:4,69 --> 0:9:7,41
Some of you may already be familiar with this.

263
0:9:7,41 --> 0:9:8,33
And some are new to our audience.

264
0:9:8,33 --> 0:9:9,33
Let me tell you all,

265
0:9:9,33 --> 0:9:10,89
in my entrepreneurial journey,

266
0:9:10,89 --> 0:9:12,42
I changed projects several times,

267
0:9:12,42 --> 0:9:14,42
even shifted industries,

268
0:9:14,42 --> 0:9:18,23
because if I hadn't pursued certain projects,

269
0:9:18,23 --> 0:9:20,61
if I hadn't ventured into certain industries,

270
0:9:20,61 --> 0:9:22,85
I would have felt unsatisfied.

271
0:9:22,85 --> 0:9:26,95
This person would say that they won't give up until they hit a brick wall.

272
0:9:26,95 --> 0:9:28,27
If you feel unwilling to let go,

273
0:9:28,27 --> 0:9:31,7
you might think it’s an unfinished business in your life.

274
0:9:31,7 --> 0:9:32,47
If you decide not to do it,

275
0:9:32,47 --> 0:9:34,83
you'll feel really bad about it.

276
0:9:35,56 --> 0:9:36,8
But if you really go for it,

277
0:9:36,8 --> 0:9:38,46
you’ll wonder why it can’t work out.

278
0:9:38,46 --> 0:9:41,36
Often, it’s a process of trial and error.

279
0:9:41,36 --> 0:9:42,4
So I often tell people

280
0:9:42,4 --> 0:9:44,4
A company wants to make money

281
0:9:44,4 --> 0:9:47,4
From the first year to the third year, everything was pretty normal

282
0:9:47,4 --> 0:9:50,36
I've already surpassed the average for most people

283
0:9:50,36 --> 0:9:53,95
I only really started making big money in the fourth year

284
0:9:53,95 --> 0:9:56,7
Before that, it was a struggle just to keep going

285
0:9:56,7 --> 0:9:57,51
Earning a little to keep going

286
0:9:57,51 --> 0:9:58,92
Earning a little to keep going

287
0:9:58,92 --> 0:10:0,52
So I tell everyone

288
0:10:0,52 --> 0:10:2,24
It's about the process of starting a business

289
0:10:2,24 --> 0:10:4,26
It's just like playing a game.

290
0:10:4,26 --> 0:10:6,86
When you start a new game, you're not familiar with it.

291
0:10:6,86 --> 0:10:8,36
You think you are familiar with it.

292
0:10:8,36 --> 0:10:11,79
Total War is the same; every new release requires me to get used to it again.

293
0:10:11,79 --> 0:10:12,67
History of the Three Kingdoms,

294
0:10:12,67 --> 0:10:13,53
Nobunaga's Ambition,

295
0:10:13,53 --> 0:10:14,59
for all these games,

296
0:10:14,59 --> 0:10:16,52
every new release requires you to adapt again.

297
0:10:16,52 --> 0:10:17,42
with every new generation.

298
0:10:17,42 --> 0:10:18,7
The gameplay will change.

299
0:10:18,7 --> 0:10:19,94
You're bound to hit some bumps.

300
0:10:19,94 --> 0:10:23,62
We often say that in RPG games, the first time you clear the game,

301
0:10:23,62 --> 0:10:24,5
it might be with the first character,

302
0:10:24,5 --> 0:10:25,38
you end up wasting them.

303
0:10:25,38 --> 0:10:26,22
The story gets wasted,

304
0:10:26,22 --> 0:10:27,95
and then you have to go back,

305
0:10:27,95 --> 0:10:29,37
spending another two hours replaying,

306
0:10:29,37 --> 0:10:31,23
the first character might get overleveled and become useless.

307
0:10:31,23 --> 0:10:32,589
Or you might miss the plot

308
0:10:32,589 --> 0:10:35,69
Your first attempt always involves a remake

309
0:10:35,69 --> 0:10:37,129
A process of rebirth, if you will

310
0:10:37,129 --> 0:10:39,89
Actually, these things are quite common

311
0:10:39,89 --> 0:10:40,529
From a life perspective

312
0:10:40,529 --> 0:10:43,13
You often have to start several times

313
0:10:43,13 --> 0:10:45,25
And think about starting a business

314
0:10:45,25 --> 0:10:46,55
When we talk about being the boss

315
0:10:46,55 --> 0:10:48,45
It’s a process of accumulating experience

316
0:10:48,45 --> 0:10:50,27
You used to be an employee

317
0:10:50,27 --> 0:10:51,87
even if you were a supervisor

318
0:10:51,87 --> 0:10:53,9
you were still an employee

319
0:10:53,9 --> 0:10:55,89
you didn't have to think like a boss

320
0:10:55,89 --> 0:10:56,569
you need to gain the boss's experience

321
0:10:56,569 --> 0:10:58,489
you have to quickly experiment and learn from mistakes

322
0:10:58,489 --> 0:10:59,909
keep making mistakes

323
0:10:59,909 --> 0:11:2,289
only through mistakes can you gain experience

324
0:11:2,289 --> 0:11:3,569
and grow

325
0:11:3,569 --> 0:11:5,92
So, just like when I bought my car,

326
0:11:5,92 --> 0:11:7,52
Why do I have to bring up the car purchase?

327
0:11:7,52 --> 0:11:10,0
If I don't actually take it for a drive,

328
0:11:10,0 --> 0:11:12,93
I won't really be able to reduce the energy consumption,

329
0:11:12,93 --> 0:11:14,69
I won't really understand the actual energy usage,

330
0:11:14,69 --> 0:11:16,56
I won't really know the hassle of charging back and forth,

331
0:11:16,56 --> 0:11:20,66
I wouldn't know how crucial the range is for this car in the summer,

332
0:11:20,66 --> 0:11:21,8
how important it is to have the air conditioning on,

333
0:11:21,8 --> 0:11:23,34
because for me,

334
0:11:23,34 --> 0:11:24,56
While affordability is crucial,

335
0:11:24,56 --> 0:11:27,71
I’m just afraid of the heat,

336
0:11:27,71 --> 0:11:29,51
so this is my actual need.

337
0:11:29,51 --> 0:11:33,98
So your first car should have some issues to teach you a lesson.

338
0:11:33,98 --> 0:11:35,56
I went all out from the start.

339
0:11:35,56 --> 0:11:37,24
Who doesn’t know a good car when they see one?

340
0:11:37,24 --> 0:11:38,7
If I had gone all out from the start,

341
0:11:38,7 --> 0:11:41,99
I wouldn’t have learned about the various data on different cars later on.

342
0:11:41,99 --> 0:11:43,53
Why is it so hard to come by?

343
0:11:43,53 --> 0:11:46,9
You might end up buying a car with more power than you need

344
0:11:46,9 --> 0:11:48,39
I'll start with the cheapest car

345
0:11:48,39 --> 0:11:49,69
To put it bluntly, just for gaming

346
0:11:49,69 --> 0:11:50,93
Start with the easiest difficulty

347
0:11:50,93 --> 0:11:52,24
Very easy

348
0:11:52,24 --> 0:11:54,66
Choose the easiest starting monarch

349
0:11:54,66 --> 0:11:55,12
Right?

350
0:11:55,12 --> 0:11:57,0
Pick the cheapest and smallest car

351
0:11:57,0 --> 0:11:58,22
After driving for a while

352
0:11:58,22 --> 0:12:2,66
Then I realized that my battery range needs to be at least 450 miles.

353
0:12:2,66 --> 0:12:4,6
It would be more appropriate if it could reach 570 miles.

354
0:12:4,6 --> 0:12:5,2
Right?

355
0:12:5,2 --> 0:12:8,28
Otherwise, I would have range anxiety that could affect my motivation to drive.

356
0:12:8,28 --> 0:12:10,88
But this issue isn't particularly severe for me.

357
0:12:10,88 --> 0:12:11,61
Why?

358
0:12:11,61 --> 0:12:12,83
Because I don't drive fast.

359
0:12:12,83 --> 0:12:13,91
I don't use the highway.

360
0:12:13,91 --> 0:12:15,95
I rarely go to places that require the highway.

361
0:12:15,95 --> 0:12:18,86
I actually shuttle between the urban and suburban areas of Beijing.

362
0:12:18,86 --> 0:12:20,9
And there's also the issue of finding parking being difficult.

363
0:12:20,9 --> 0:12:22,66
But parking this small car isn't hard.

364
0:12:22,66 --> 0:12:23,6
Right?

365
0:12:23,6 --> 0:12:25,84
Moreover, insurance for a smaller car is also cheaper.

366
0:12:25,84 --> 0:12:30,73
So it's important to leave room for mistakes.

367
0:12:30,73 --> 0:12:32,67
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.

368
0:12:32,67 --> 0:12:35,97
Your first car is bound to be a less ideal purchase.

369
0:12:35,97 --> 0:12:38,11
My first motorcycle

370
0:12:38,11 --> 0:12:40,19
I was pretty happy with the UI.

371
0:12:40,19 --> 0:12:43,469
But I also carefully selected several motorcycles.

372
0:12:43,469 --> 0:12:45,469
In the past, I've ridden more than just the UI5.

373
0:12:45,469 --> 0:12:46,549
I've ridden other bikes as well.

374
0:12:46,549 --> 0:12:47,819
Like the Wangjiang Suzuki,

375
0:12:47,819 --> 0:12:51,119
various replicas of tombs,

376
0:12:51,119 --> 0:12:52,87
and Haojue, among others.

377
0:12:52,87 --> 0:12:54,91
But let's not get into that now.

378
0:12:54,91 --> 0:12:58,47
As for electric scooters, this is my sixth one.

379
0:12:58,47 --> 0:12:59,45
Right?

380
0:12:59,45 --> 0:13:1,68
Was it the sixth or the seventh? I forgot.

381
0:13:1,68 --> 0:13:3,2
Anyway, let me count.

382
0:13:3,2 --> 0:13:3,9
The first one.

383
0:13:3,9 --> 0:13:4,64
The second one.

384
0:13:4,64 --> 0:13:5,64
The third one.

385
0:13:5,64 --> 0:13:6,6
The fourth one.

386
0:13:6,6 --> 0:13:7,16
The fifth one.

387
0:13:7,16 --> 0:13:8,0
The sixth one, right.

388
0:13:8,0 --> 0:13:9,26
This is the sixth car.

389
0:13:9,26 --> 0:13:11,12
For the sixth car, I bought number 9.

390
0:13:11,12 --> 0:13:12,99
Next time, I'll definitely go for the set.

391
0:13:12,99 --> 0:13:14,69
Because I'm not a big fan of the calf.

392
0:13:14,69 --> 0:13:15,71
That's why I chose number 9.

393
0:13:15,71 --> 0:13:16,91
I think the calf is too expensive.

394
0:13:16,91 --> 0:13:18,27
But number 9 isn't cheap either.

395
0:13:18,27 --> 0:13:19,83
But now, looking at the set,

396
0:13:19,83 --> 0:13:20,97
it does seem more suitable.

397
0:13:20,97 --> 0:13:22,13
It suits my taste

398
0:13:22,13 --> 0:13:25,15
But when I bought it, it was already the new national standard

399
0:13:25,15 --> 0:13:27,47
I might not be able to find such a good bike

400
0:13:27,47 --> 0:13:32,53
But I realized what I need most from a motorcycle

401
0:13:32,53 --> 0:13:34,11
It's not the engine size

402
0:13:34,31 --> 0:13:35,97
It's not the price

403
0:13:35,97 --> 0:13:37,85
It's the range

404
0:13:37,85 --> 0:13:42,79
My UY125 with an extra fuel tank can run 700km

405
0:13:42,79 --> 0:13:43,759
What I care about the most is the range

406
0:13:43,759 --> 0:13:45,879
Because I don't drive as fast as others

407
0:13:45,879 --> 0:13:48,75
so when I consider a car, the last thing I pay attention to is the range

408
0:13:48,75 --> 0:13:50,39
so when I buy a car

409
0:13:50,39 --> 0:13:51,43
I didn't focus on the range

410
0:13:51,43 --> 0:13:54,26
but cars with a high range are usually quite expensive

411
0:13:54,26 --> 0:13:56,5
so in the future when I consider a car

412
0:13:56,5 --> 0:13:58,65
I'll try to maximize its range

413
0:13:58,65 --> 0:13:59,57
the power

414
0:13:59,57 --> 0:14:1,47
the interior and such, I can be more flexible with

415
0:14:1,47 --> 0:14:3,44
So I know what car to switch to in the future.

416
0:14:3,44 --> 0:14:5,58
But you're bound to make mistakes the first time.

417
0:14:5,58 --> 0:14:7,28
It's your first marriage, after all.

418
0:14:7,28 --> 0:14:8,63
Your first time dating a girlfriend.

419
0:14:8,63 --> 0:14:10,55
The first time looking for a job, you'll make mistakes.

420
0:14:10,55 --> 0:14:12,67
You need to give yourself room to make mistakes.

421
0:14:12,67 --> 0:14:14,49
Like how Brother Rong got married in a hurry.

422
0:14:14,49 --> 0:14:16,41
Even though I've dated so many times,

423
0:14:16,41 --> 0:14:18,89
But in the end, I ended up with a rushed marriage too.

424
0:14:18,89 --> 0:14:21,21
This means no lessons have been learned.

425
0:14:21,21 --> 0:14:23,49
You can't just marry someone after two months.

426
0:14:23,49 --> 0:14:26,11
You should take at least a year or two to get to know them.

427
0:14:26,11 --> 0:14:26,69
Right?

428
0:14:26,69 --> 0:14:28,37
Because a lot of a person's dark sides,

429
0:14:28,37 --> 0:14:30,69
many of their issues won't be revealed quickly.

430
0:14:30,69 --> 0:14:32,13
So that's how it is.

431
0:14:32,13 --> 0:14:33,53
Including yourself, you also need time to reveal yourself.

432
0:14:33,53 --> 0:14:34,69
Right?

433
0:14:34,69 --> 0:14:34,669
Without you

434
0:14:34,669 --> 0:14:35,749
You get annoyed with others

435
0:14:35,749 --> 0:14:36,869
Others will get annoyed with you too

436
0:14:36,869 --> 0:14:37,189
Right?

437
0:14:37,189 --> 0:14:38,389
Others lose their patience with you

438
0:14:38,389 --> 0:14:39,269
People want to say goodbye

439
0:14:39,269 --> 0:14:41,69
Is it that getting married becomes quite troublesome?

440
0:14:41,69 --> 0:14:43,83
Things would be better if not in a married state

441
0:14:43,83 --> 0:14:48,4
So these matters can't be decided quickly

442
0:14:48,4 --> 0:14:50,1
But it's important to test and learn quickly

443
0:14:50,1 --> 0:14:53,2
Because quick decision-making, like what Brother Rong did this time

444
0:14:53,2 --> 0:14:56,44
He bought a motorcycle and then immediately bought a car

445
0:14:56,44 --> 0:14:59,63
Putting two happy families together doesn't necessarily make them happier

446
0:14:59,63 --> 0:15:0,87
Right?

447
0:15:0,87 --> 0:15:2,11
The joy of riding a motorcycle

448
0:15:2,11 --> 0:15:4,19
The joy of driving a car is a different story

449
0:15:4,19 --> 0:15:4,74
Buddy

450
0:15:4,74 --> 0:15:7,7
So it's still better to think things through carefully

451
0:15:7,7 --> 0:15:8,42
Let's think about it in the long term.

452
0:15:8,42 --> 0:15:9,78
But this time, since it's bought, it's bought.

453
0:15:9,78 --> 0:15:11,6
It's no big deal.

454
0:15:11,6 --> 0:15:12,12
I'm not short of money.

455
0:15:12,12 --> 0:15:12,62
Right?

456
0:15:12,62 --> 0:15:14,54
I bought this car for 33,600.

457
0:15:14,54 --> 0:15:15,69
I gave him a discount.

458
0:15:15,69 --> 0:15:16,97
Should we cancel the insurance?

459
0:15:16,97 --> 0:15:17,99
I gave it a discounted price.

460
0:15:17,99 --> 0:15:19,49
You can still buy more expensive cars.

461
0:15:19,49 --> 0:15:19,89
Right?

462
0:15:19,89 --> 0:15:21,49
I might switch my car in winter.

463
0:15:21,49 --> 0:15:24,1
Yeah, it’s really possible to drive it for five or six months.

464
0:15:24,1 --> 0:15:26,28
I might change my car after a year.

465
0:15:26,28 --> 0:15:27,36
So, there’s no need to worry too much.

466
0:15:27,36 --> 0:15:30,37
Cars don’t have an expiration date for being on the road anyway.

467
0:15:30,37 --> 0:15:36,26
In reality, I don’t get many opportunities to drive.

468
0:15:36,26 --> 0:15:37,96
I also find parking to be a hassle.

469
0:15:37,96 --> 0:15:39,64
I might just call a ride-hailing car.

470
0:15:39,64 --> 0:15:42,4
Isn't it that I can't possibly avoid drinking when I go out for dinner?

471
0:15:42,4 --> 0:15:42,52
Right?

472
0:15:42,52 --> 0:15:44,4
So many times, it ends up like this.

473
0:15:44,4 --> 0:15:46,32
In the end, I have to call a designated driver.

474
0:15:46,32 --> 0:15:47,9
It’s much more expensive than calling a ride-hailing car.

475
0:15:47,9 --> 0:15:49,86
So, we still stand by our saying.

476
0:15:49,86 --> 0:15:52,38
Today, we’ve had a casual chat with everyone.

477
0:15:52,38 --> 0:15:53,84
This has already been 16 minutes.

478
0:15:53,84 --> 0:15:58,79
A practical tip for everyone is to avoid the mindset of being bound to make mistakes.

479
0:15:58,79 --> 0:16:1,19
Don't let the student mentality dominate your mind.

480
0:16:1,19 --> 0:16:2,55
Be brave enough to make mistakes.

481
0:16:2,55 --> 0:16:3,63
Be bold enough to start.

482
0:16:3,63 --> 0:16:6,19
Even if the initial situation isn't ideal.

483
0:16:6,19 --> 0:16:9,89
Believe that you will mess up the first time, and that's okay.

484
0:16:9,89 --> 0:16:12,49
Give yourself the space to fail the first time.

485
0:16:12,49 --> 0:16:13,93
Speaking practically,

486
0:16:13,93 --> 0:16:15,97
regardless of how much my car depreciates in the end.

487
0:16:15,97 --> 0:16:16,21
Negotiate

488
0:16:16,21 --> 0:16:17,75
20,000 yuan can always be negotiated

489
0:16:17,75 --> 0:16:21,31
So for my first attempt, I used 30,000 yuan to quickly test and learn from mistakes

490
0:16:21,31 --> 0:16:23,33
That’s when I realized how much I care about the range

491
0:16:23,33 --> 0:16:27,12
The most important thing I like about my motorcycle is its range

492
0:16:27,12 --> 0:16:27,6
Right?

493
0:16:27,6 --> 0:16:28,86
Because I suffer from range anxiety

494
0:16:28,86 --> 0:16:30,26
I always want it to be at 100%

495
0:16:30,26 --> 0:16:32,2
I guess I have a bit of an OCD

496
0:16:32,2 --> 0:16:36,4
So I've been riding the motorcycle for a long time without thinking about refueling.

497
0:16:36,4 --> 0:16:37,2
The fuel gauge doesn't even drop.

498
0:16:37,2 --> 0:16:37,72
Right?

499
0:16:37,72 --> 0:16:40,24
It uses the 10 liters in the reserve tank before it starts using the main tank.

500
0:16:40,24 --> 0:16:41,9
What about the 6 liters?

501
0:16:41,9 --> 0:16:41,61
To be honest,

502
0:16:41,61 --> 0:16:43,77
I might keep the main tank full most of the time,

503
0:16:43,77 --> 0:16:45,89
and only refill the reserve tank after a while.

504
0:16:45,89 --> 0:16:46,81
That's how it usually goes.

505
0:16:46,81 --> 0:16:47,99
Because he has a fuel gauge to show

506
0:16:47,99 --> 0:16:50,1
Or every time I finish the reserve tank

507
0:16:50,1 --> 0:16:51,69
I immediately refill the reserve tank

508
0:16:51,69 --> 0:16:52,81
I don’t really care about the main tank

509
0:16:52,81 --> 0:16:53,57
It could be like that

510
0:16:53,57 --> 0:16:54,61
Because you have to fill the main tank first

511
0:16:54,61 --> 0:16:55,85
Then the reserve tank

512
0:16:55,85 --> 0:16:57,25
I won’t go into the specifics

513
0:16:57,25 --> 0:16:59,13
Anyway, I feel that the car, to me

514
0:16:59,13 --> 0:17:0,8
You've only done this once.

515
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:3,64
But both times you went to power up.

516
0:17:3,64 --> 0:17:6,34
Why is it that one time you drove all the way to the eastern fifth ring?

517
0:17:6,34 --> 0:17:7,84
From Shunyi to Chaoyang,

518
0:17:7,84 --> 0:17:9,0
and then back from Chaoyang to Shunyi,

519
0:17:9,0 --> 0:17:9,6
you charged once.

520
0:17:9,6 --> 0:17:12,11
This time, you drove from Shunyi to Haidian,

521
0:17:12,11 --> 0:17:12,99
and used up the battery again,

522
0:17:12,99 --> 0:17:13,73
using it up in one go.

523
0:17:13,73 --> 0:17:15,39
But this time I've gained some experience.

524
0:17:15,39 --> 0:17:17,69
As long as you cross districts and it's over 30km.

525
0:17:17,69 --> 0:17:20,88
It might consume 50 or even 70 kilometers of range.

526
0:17:20,88 --> 0:17:23,82
You can only gain true knowledge through practice.

527
0:17:23,82 --> 0:17:25,2
To be honest.

528
0:17:25,2 --> 0:17:26,68
Including having insurance.

529
0:17:26,68 --> 0:17:28,4
Don't be afraid of minor incidents.

530
0:17:28,4 --> 0:17:30,29
As long as it's not a serious accident.

531
0:17:30,29 --> 0:17:31,81
We should talk about minor scratches.

532
0:17:31,81 --> 0:17:32,63
That's all perfectly normal.

533
0:17:32,63 --> 0:17:36,49
Is it true that you can only solve these problems when you encounter them?

534
0:17:36,49 --> 0:17:38,61
Just like our great War of Resistance against Japan.

535
0:17:38,61 --> 0:17:41,92
Learning from combat and from the enemy.

536
0:17:46,48 --> 0:17:47,5
What tactics do they have?

537
0:17:47,5 --> 0:17:48,98
Regarding their tactics,

538
0:17:48,98 --> 0:17:51,449
What tactics should we use to counter them?

539
0:17:51,449 --> 0:17:53,929
The 80th anniversary of the victory in the great War of Resistance against Japan.

540
0:17:53,929 --> 0:17:55,429
The grand military parade is about to begin.

541
0:17:55,429 --> 0:17:58,189
All citizens of Beijing will be very excited.

542
0:17:58,189 --> 0:18:3,8
A passionate heart awaits this grand parade.

543
0:18:3,8 --> 0:18:4,42
Let's talk about this.

544
0:18:4,42 --> 0:18:5,4
Exactly.

545
0:18:5,4 --> 0:18:6,92
You need to learn from mistakes.

546
0:18:6,92 --> 0:18:8,87
You need to learn from collisions,

547
0:18:8,87 --> 0:18:10,29
In the process of exchange,

548
0:18:10,29 --> 0:18:11,79
Learn from these collisions,

549
0:18:11,79 --> 0:18:13,29
Learn from confrontation.

550
0:18:13,29 --> 0:18:16,47
Why do I always tell everyone to engage in competitive sports?

551
0:18:16,47 --> 0:18:17,67
Especially when you're young.

552
0:18:17,67 --> 0:18:18,81
One is to release hormones,

553
0:18:18,81 --> 0:18:21,15
Release your violent tendencies,

554
0:18:21,15 --> 0:18:25,93
And the other is to cultivate your competitive spirit.

555
0:18:25,93 --> 0:18:26,95
So,

556
0:18:26,95 --> 0:18:28,3
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

557
0:18:28,3 --> 0:18:30,71
Even if it's a simple and silly thing,

558
0:18:30,71 --> 0:18:33,88
Like Brother Rong driving a small, old car and showing off,

559
0:18:33,88 --> 0:18:35,6
It's embarrassing and not very dignified,

560
0:18:35,6 --> 0:18:37,48
But you won't always drive such a car.

561
0:18:37,48 --> 0:18:39,6
This is just my first car.

562
0:18:39,6 --> 0:18:41,36
For my second car,

563
0:18:41,36 --> 0:18:41,92
Third car,

564
0:18:41,92 --> 0:18:42,56
Fourth car,

565
0:18:42,56 --> 0:18:43,48
Fifth car,

566
0:18:43,48 --> 0:18:45,69
I might own 20 cars in my lifetime.

567
0:18:45,69 --> 0:18:47,73
It's also a knowledge reserve,

568
0:18:47,73 --> 0:18:49,51
A skill reserve.

569
0:18:49,51 --> 0:18:50,83
It's easy to go from frugality to luxury,

570
0:18:50,83 --> 0:18:51,85
But hard to go from luxury to frugality.

571
0:18:51,85 --> 0:18:53,4
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

572
0:18:53,4 --> 0:18:56,68
Don't have an aversion to making mistakes in the initial stages.

573
0:18:56,68 --> 0:18:58,6
Quickly try and make mistakes.

574
0:18:58,6 --> 0:18:59,889
Continuously challenge yourself,

575
0:18:59,889 --> 0:19:1,469
Continuously push yourself to make mistakes,

576
0:19:1,469 --> 0:19:5,69
Then you'll understand the system, just like when I play games,

577
0:19:5,69 --> 0:19:6,729
I might discover a game mechanism on the 20th try,

578
0:19:6,729 --> 0:19:8,86
Or some shortcuts,

579
0:19:8,86 --> 0:19:10,18
That I've never tried before,

580
0:19:10,18 --> 0:19:11,46
Turns out they're so convenient.

581
0:19:11,46 --> 0:19:12,5
There are many ways to beat the game,

582
0:19:12,5 --> 0:19:14,62
That I haven't tried,

583
0:19:14,62 --> 0:19:15,5
Haven't fully explored the system.

584
0:19:15,5 --> 0:19:16,82
So you need to fully understand something,

585
0:19:16,82 --> 0:19:19,1
For example, flying,

586
0:19:19,1 --> 0:19:20,6
Or sailing,

587
0:19:20,6 --> 0:19:21,51
Or driving—

588
0:19:21,51 --> 0:19:23,67
You will certainly make many mistakes.

589
0:19:23,67 --> 0:19:25,54
You need to allow yourself to grow gradually.

590
0:19:25,54 --> 0:19:27,52
The more you drive, the better you'll get.

591
0:19:27,52 --> 0:19:29,14
The more you play, the better you'll get.

592
0:19:29,14 --> 0:19:30,66
Life is the same,

593
0:19:30,66 --> 0:19:31,68
The more mistakes you make,

594
0:19:31,68 --> 0:19:32,74
The more you'll naturally understand everything.

595
0:19:32,74 --> 0:19:34,52
It all makes sense now.
