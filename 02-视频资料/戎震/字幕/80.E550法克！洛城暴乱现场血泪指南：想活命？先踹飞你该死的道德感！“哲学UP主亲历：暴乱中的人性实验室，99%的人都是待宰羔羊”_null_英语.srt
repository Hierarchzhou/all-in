0:0:0,28 --> 0:0:1,78
Hi, Mattress 557

2
0:0:1,78 --> 0:0:5,18
This is truly an educational and entertaining long-term show.

3
0:0:5,18 --> 0:0:8,3
Today, we saw Los Angeles,

4
0:0:8,3 --> 0:0:12,14
or LA, where some incidents occurred.

5
0:0:12,14 --> 0:0:14,42
We'll discuss this incident today

6
0:0:14,42 --> 0:0:16,1
and share some of our own thoughts.

7
0:0:16,1 --> 0:0:19,9
First, I'll be showing off in this video.

8
0:0:19,9 --> 0:0:22,32
by using a lot of English words,

9
0:0:22,32 --> 0:0:23,929
like 'rise'.

10
0:0:23,929 --> 0:0:26,89
Curve functional guard

11
0:0:26,89 --> 0:0:28,389
police force LAPD

12
0:0:28,389 --> 0:0:31,4
riot and tear gas

13
0:0:31,4 --> 0:0:33,82
rubber bullets

14
0:0:33,82 --> 0:0:35,32
and more

15
0:0:35,32 --> 0:0:37,6
police bullets in the west

16
0:0:37,6 --> 0:0:39,7
and other things

17
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:43,38
crowd control and rubber bullets

18
0:0:43,38 --> 0:0:45,54
they talk about these kinds of things

19
0:0:45,54 --> 0:0:50,23
First, let's talk about this armor stacking.

20
0:0:50,23 --> 0:0:52,93
In my brief life,

21
0:0:52,93 --> 0:0:55,81
I've encountered RIO many times,

22
0:0:55,81 --> 0:0:58,13
especially during my time abroad.

23
0:0:58,13 --> 0:1:0,73
While studying and traveling overseas,

24
0:1:0,73 --> 0:1:4,319
you're bound to encounter such situations.

25
0:1:4,319 --> 0:1:8,119
Sometimes you might suddenly find yourself,

26
0:1:8,119 --> 0:1:9,139
in the middle of a crisis overnight,

27
0:1:9,139 --> 0:1:10,999
trapped in a residence.

28
0:1:10,999 --> 0:1:13,24
Inside an apartment or hotel room

29
0:1:13,24 --> 0:1:15,18
and you find yourself unarmed

30
0:1:15,18 --> 0:1:19,34
in this episode, I’ll primarily teach you how to escape

31
0:1:19,34 --> 0:1:22,55
when is the best time to seek survival?

32
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:26,39
I hope you never have to go to such places

33
0:1:26,39 --> 0:1:31,68
and these riots will only escalate

34
0:1:31,68 --> 0:1:34,5
it will gradually turn into looting

35
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:37,72
like today in LA, there’s already been looting

36
0:1:37,72 --> 0:1:41,0
first of all, I really admire our frontline reporter

37
0:1:41,0 --> 0:1:44,25
We are still delving into this chaotic area.

38
0:1:44,25 --> 0:1:45,51
Reporting is ongoing.

39
0:1:45,51 --> 0:1:47,24
The CCTV reporter has already arrived.

40
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:50,68
And several American bloggers have also joined in,

41
0:1:50,68 --> 0:1:51,4
like Li Sanjin,

42
0:1:51,4 --> 0:1:52,4
and Commander Zhang,

43
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:54,1
they’ve talked about everything related to this event.

44
0:1:54,1 --> 0:1:56,87
Regarding the political aspects,

45
0:1:56,87 --> 0:1:58,21
these political matters.

46
0:1:58,21 --> 0:2:0,699
Regarding whether to support immigration or be against it

47
0:2:0,699 --> 0:2:3,739
the rednecks are still backing the governor of Louisiana

48
0:2:3,739 --> 0:2:4,679
I won't take a stance on this

49
0:2:4,679 --> 0:2:6,47
Firstly, I am not a U.S. citizen

50
0:2:6,47 --> 0:2:9,55
Secondly, when it comes to specific political leanings

51
0:2:9,55 --> 0:2:11,19
I won't share my personal views either

52
0:2:11,19 --> 0:2:14,37
You might guess that I favor immigration

53
0:2:14,37 --> 0:2:17,42
whether I am liberal or conservative

54
0:2:17,42 --> 0:2:18,7
but that doesn't really matter

55
0:2:18,7 --> 0:2:19,98
Because I am a Chinese citizen.

56
0:2:19,98 --> 0:2:23,14
So when it comes to the internal affairs of other countries,

57
0:2:23,14 --> 0:2:24,48
we do not interfere.

58
0:2:24,48 --> 0:2:27,0
I won’t express my personal opinions on this matter.

59
0:2:27,0 --> 0:2:28,48
If I were to comment on such issues,

60
0:2:28,48 --> 0:2:29,48
people would start taking sides,

61
0:2:29,48 --> 0:2:32,16
and start arguing with each other from a distance.

62
0:2:32,16 --> 0:2:33,22
I find that utterly pointless.

63
0:2:33,22 --> 0:2:37,14
I am someone who hopes to promote unity.

64
0:2:37,14 --> 0:2:38,72
So, I'd like to share a point with everyone.

65
0:2:38,72 --> 0:2:40,69
This is a rather neutral piece of advice.

66
0:2:40,69 --> 0:2:43,29
It's about how to handle such situations and get away.

67
0:2:43,29 --> 0:2:44,29
In this context,

68
0:2:44,29 --> 0:2:47,1
as they say, in the 36 Stratagems, retreat is the best option.

69
0:2:47,1 --> 0:2:50,21
It's always safest to retreat at the earliest opportunity.

70
0:2:50,21 --> 0:2:53,49
Then you might find yourself, for example, trapped in a hotel room,

71
0:2:53,49 --> 0:2:56,13
or stuck in a standalone house,

72
0:2:56,13 --> 0:2:57,87
or confined in an apartment.

73
0:2:57,87 --> 0:2:59,1
First of all, let me say

74
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:1,15
The first thing you should do is

75
0:3:1,15 --> 0:3:2,89
Block the entrances and exits

76
0:3:2,89 --> 0:3:5,91
The specific method to block the entrances and exits is

77
0:3:5,91 --> 0:3:9,49
If you don't have many tools on hand

78
0:3:9,49 --> 0:3:10,67
That can be quite troublesome

79
0:3:10,67 --> 0:3:11,85
When you have in your possession

80
0:3:11,85 --> 0:3:14,17
For example, if you're in a separate room with tools

81
0:3:14,17 --> 0:3:18,93
I suggest you partially seal the door, just half of it

82
0:3:18,93 --> 0:3:21,83
Then, the lower part should primarily be able to reach the door handle.

83
0:3:21,83 --> 0:3:22,69
It should allow for entry and exit.

84
0:3:22,69 --> 0:3:24,56
Then, you enter in a kneeling position.

85
0:3:24,56 --> 0:3:26,96
You need to prevent this area from being compromised.

86
0:3:26,96 --> 0:3:29,72
Ideally, you shouldn't have just this one exit.

87
0:3:29,72 --> 0:3:31,4
Once the window is set up,

88
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:34,48
it should look like a zombie-proof fortification.

89
0:3:34,48 --> 0:3:36,82
Make sure you have escape equipment ready by the window.

90
0:3:36,82 --> 0:3:38,3
You should be able to climb out through the window basically.

91
0:3:38,3 --> 0:3:40,82
If your home is on the second floor,

92
0:3:40,82 --> 0:3:42,18
it's best to have it on both the second and first floors.

93
0:3:42,18 --> 0:3:44,78
While it's more convenient for coming and going,

94
0:3:44,78 --> 0:3:48,16
it also means you might be the first to be disturbed by intruders.

95
0:3:48,16 --> 0:3:49,43
If you have a safe room,

96
0:3:49,43 --> 0:3:51,65
or a basement,

97
0:3:51,65 --> 0:3:52,71
that would be even better.

98
0:3:52,71 --> 0:3:53,47
If you live in an apartment,

99
0:3:54,35 --> 0:3:55,3
There's nothing we can do.

100
0:3:55,3 --> 0:3:57,38
So you might not have any other entrances or exits.

101
0:3:57,38 --> 0:3:59,14
But first, you need to block the main ones.

102
0:3:59,14 --> 0:4:0,17
The primary entrances and exits.

103
0:4:0,17 --> 0:4:1,51
That's what we mean when we say...

104
0:4:1,51 --> 0:4:3,81
You should have things like a corneal machine,

105
0:4:3,81 --> 0:4:4,73
a nail gun,

106
0:4:4,73 --> 0:4:7,22
We refer to these things as living in America.

107
0:4:7,22 --> 0:4:10,2
if you're staying at a regular hotel.

108
0:4:10,2 --> 0:4:12,54
You should use the wardrobe to block the room right away.

109
0:4:12,54 --> 0:4:14,9
Because these looters,

110
0:4:14,9 --> 0:4:16,45
when they see that your place is hard to get into,

111
0:4:16,45 --> 0:4:19,71
they won’t bother to loot. Remember,

112
0:4:19,71 --> 0:4:20,55
at this point,

113
0:4:20,55 --> 0:4:23,66
the first thing you should change is your appearance.

114
0:4:23,66 --> 0:4:25,68
That means if you have long hair,

115
0:4:25,68 --> 0:4:26,78
try to tie it up with a headband.

116
0:4:26,78 --> 0:4:28,1
If you have short hair,

117
0:4:28,1 --> 0:4:30,8
Try to get your hair cut as short as possible

118
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:32,74
Then you can put on the mask

119
0:4:32,74 --> 0:4:33,84
Just put on the mask

120
0:4:33,84 --> 0:4:36,6
But if you encounter the police, take it off quickly

121
0:4:36,6 --> 0:4:40,17
The most important thing is that you can't look like

122
0:4:40,17 --> 0:4:42,909
Like a mobster

123
0:4:42,909 --> 0:4:46,69
You should look harmless, that's the best

124
0:4:46,69 --> 0:4:47,949
Of course, if you blend into the crowd

125
0:4:47,949 --> 0:4:50,159
If you mix into this group of people

126
0:4:50,159 --> 0:4:51,959
Try to dress the same as them

127
0:4:51,959 --> 0:4:52,759
Don’t stand out too much

128
0:4:52,759 --> 0:4:54,119
Don’t look like a foreigner

129
0:4:54,119 --> 0:4:55,79
This is crucial

130
0:4:55,79 --> 0:4:58,97
Don’t bring anything that could cause misunderstandings

131
0:4:58,97 --> 0:4:59,83
like flags

132
0:4:59,83 --> 0:5:0,89
or slogans and such

133
0:5:0,89 --> 0:5:1,69
Of course

134
0:5:1,69 --> 0:5:3,74
if you have a special job

135
0:5:3,74 --> 0:5:4,82
You need to blend into the crowd.

136
0:5:4,82 --> 0:5:6,4
At this point, there's another perspective.

137
0:5:6,4 --> 0:5:8,419
Because the guiding principle is different.

138
0:5:8,419 --> 0:5:11,299
I suggest that no matter what, you should always...

139
0:5:11,299 --> 0:5:14,65
I recommend you always act in the early hours of the morning.

140
0:5:14,65 --> 0:5:17,73
Between four and seven or eight in the morning.

141
0:5:17,73 --> 0:5:20,55
This is the time for long journeys or crossing dangerous areas.

142
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:29,0
Because during this time, those who go out to plunder...

143
0:5:29,0 --> 0:5:30,799
are usually the most tired.

144
0:5:30,799 --> 0:5:33,239
This is also the time when killers are on the loose.

145
0:5:33,239 --> 0:5:34,359
Actually, it's not the early part of the night.

146
0:5:34,359 --> 0:5:36,9
Many people are still up and about during the early hours.

147
0:5:36,9 --> 0:5:38,5
But by four or five in the morning, most are exhausted.

148
0:5:38,5 --> 0:5:39,37
And people have mostly settled down.

149
0:5:39,37 --> 0:5:42,26
Whether you're riding a motorcycle or walking,

150
0:5:42,26 --> 0:5:43,6
or rowing a boat,

151
0:5:43,6 --> 0:5:44,18
or driving a car,

152
0:5:44,18 --> 0:5:45,64
you can traverse through various streets and alleys.

153
0:5:45,64 --> 0:5:47,81
In some areas, it is the safest

154
0:5:47,81 --> 0:5:49,61
And at this point

155
0:5:49,61 --> 0:5:51,87
If you didn't manage to escape the city in time

156
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:53,33
You might not be able to get out

157
0:5:53,33 --> 0:5:55,71
At this time, you should try to survive for as long as possible

158
0:5:55,71 --> 0:5:58,35
The prerequisite for surviving longer is having food

159
0:5:58,35 --> 0:5:59,55
Water, warm clothing, and medicine

160
0:5:59,55 --> 0:6:2,71
So you should stock up on things that are hard to find normally

161
0:6:2,71 --> 0:6:3,51
Like antibiotics

162
0:6:3,51 --> 0:6:4,429
Antibiotics

163
0:6:4,429 --> 0:6:5,589
All sorts of things

164
0:6:5,589 --> 0:6:6,749
And some first-aid medications

165
0:6:6,749 --> 0:6:8,229
As well as medications for chronic conditions

166
0:6:8,229 --> 0:6:9,189
Such as heart disease medications

167
0:6:9,189 --> 0:6:10,51
Allergy treatments

168
0:6:10,51 --> 0:6:11,39
All these items should be included

169
0:6:11,39 --> 0:6:12,91
If you have any chronic conditions

170
0:6:12,91 --> 0:6:14,76
If you have any such special health issues

171
0:6:14,76 --> 0:6:16,4
You need to get your medication in advance.

172
0:6:16,4 --> 0:6:17,8
This is crucial.

173
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:18,86
It's vital to your survival.

174
0:6:18,86 --> 0:6:20,34
When it comes to food and water,

175
0:6:20,34 --> 0:6:22,1
if currency no longer works,

176
0:6:22,1 --> 0:6:23,74
you'll be in the same boat as everyone else,

177
0:6:23,74 --> 0:6:24,62
having to resort to taking what you need.

178
0:6:24,62 --> 0:6:25,72
Of course,

179
0:6:25,72 --> 0:6:28,2
we're not talking about stealing from others.

180
0:6:28,2 --> 0:6:29,4
I mean, in many places

181
0:6:29,4 --> 0:6:32,81
like, for example, some stores

182
0:6:32,81 --> 0:6:34,21
some general stores and such

183
0:6:34,21 --> 0:6:36,29
sometimes, how should I put it

184
0:6:36,29 --> 0:6:37,93
they might keep their doors locked

185
0:6:37,93 --> 0:6:39,97
of course, if you're in a situation where you can't survive

186
0:6:39,97 --> 0:6:40,81
in cases of emergency and self-preservation

187
0:6:40,81 --> 0:6:42,26
that's a different story

188
0:6:42,26 --> 0:6:43,86
of course, as long as there's no water cut-off

189
0:6:43,86 --> 0:6:44,82
If the power hasn't been cut off,

190
0:6:44,82 --> 0:6:46,58
you should first use a container to collect water.

191
0:6:46,58 --> 0:6:48,59
First, gather some water.

192
0:6:48,59 --> 0:6:51,23
If you have a barrel or something similar to collect rainwater,

193
0:6:51,23 --> 0:6:53,7
you can collect rainwater during the rainy season.

194
0:6:53,7 --> 0:6:55,829
But in the city, this isn't very practical.

195
0:6:55,829 --> 0:6:58,789
I strongly recommend that everyone check out the SAS,

196
0:6:58,789 --> 0:7:2,41
which is the Special Air Service from the UK,

197
0:7:2,41 --> 0:7:4,25
and their urban survival guide.

198
0:7:4,25 --> 0:7:7,11
Of course, he's talking about infiltration.

199
0:7:7,11 --> 0:7:10,45
It's about gathering intelligence while sneaking in.

200
0:7:10,45 --> 0:7:12,81
But for the average person,

201
0:7:12,81 --> 0:7:15,9
the concept of extraction is also important.

202
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:17,43
This is actually quite useful as well.

203
0:7:17,43 --> 0:7:19,15
What you need to do is

204
0:7:19,15 --> 0:7:23,91
have some means of self-defense,

205
0:7:23,91 --> 0:7:25,14
some weapons,

206
0:7:25,14 --> 0:7:27,6
but they shouldn't be lethal weapons.

207
0:7:27,6 --> 0:7:29,72
It's the kind of thing that's particularly lethal.

208
0:7:29,72 --> 0:7:31,32
If you have something particularly lethal,

209
0:7:31,32 --> 0:7:33,99
it's likely to be noticed by others.

210
0:7:33,99 --> 0:7:36,49
For example, the police force might notice it.

211
0:7:36,49 --> 0:7:38,27
They might consider you a bad guy.

212
0:7:38,27 --> 0:7:39,79
But generally speaking,

213
0:7:39,79 --> 0:7:40,57
we say,

214
0:7:40,57 --> 0:7:43,64
in a normal environment,

215
0:7:43,64 --> 0:7:46,28
you should know that you can't get that many weapons.

216
0:7:46,28 --> 0:7:46,92
To talk about it,

217
0:7:46,92 --> 0:7:48,35
what do you think?

218
0:7:48,35 --> 0:7:51,19
using an umbrella, that’s a kind of long-handled item,

219
0:7:51,19 --> 0:7:53,31
I remember I mentioned this to everyone before,

220
0:7:53,31 --> 0:7:56,81
I did a segment on Europe back then,

221
0:7:56,81 --> 0:7:58,25
that was around episode 200,

222
0:7:58,25 --> 0:7:59,57
I talked about the security situation in Europe,

223
0:7:59,57 --> 0:8:1,85
because at that time, there was a possibility that the security situation in Europe,

224
0:8:1,85 --> 0:8:2,89
wasn’t good.

225
0:8:2,89 --> 0:8:4,31
So back then, I told everyone

226
0:8:4,31 --> 0:8:6,11
that umbrellas are incredibly versatile

227
0:8:6,11 --> 0:8:9,97
they can block things

228
0:8:9,97 --> 0:8:11,5
like tear gas

229
0:8:11,5 --> 0:8:11,93
and other items

230
0:8:11,93 --> 0:8:14,65
and in critical moments, they can be used like a bayonet

231
0:8:14,65 --> 0:8:16,3
to jab at the opponent

232
0:8:16,3 --> 0:8:18,61
so they can also be used for protection from the rain

233
0:8:18,61 --> 0:8:19,89
the material of the umbrella

234
0:8:19,89 --> 0:8:21,63
It’s a bit tricky to describe

235
0:8:21,63 --> 0:8:22,37
It’s quite sturdy

236
0:8:22,37 --> 0:8:24,83
So you should keep a few on hand

237
0:8:24,83 --> 0:8:26,87
If you’re in a home environment

238
0:8:26,87 --> 0:8:27,79
I suggest that you

239
0:8:27,79 --> 0:8:29,97
If you have some duct tape or something

240
0:8:29,97 --> 0:8:32,61
Or anything like that

241
0:8:32,61 --> 0:8:34,81
Try to make long-handled weapons

242
0:8:34,81 --> 0:8:36,55
Don’t make short-handled ones

243
0:8:36,55 --> 0:8:39,2
Because one person's abilities are limited

244
0:8:39,2 --> 0:8:41,3
This is something I often discuss with women's self-defense groups

245
0:8:41,3 --> 0:8:42,7
These people who are into women's self-defense

246
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:43,96
I often exchange ideas with them

247
0:8:43,96 --> 0:8:45,6
If weapons can be used

248
0:8:45,6 --> 0:8:46,43
In situations where weapons are used

249
0:8:46,43 --> 0:8:49,23
And when using weapons, try to avoid short or long handles

250
0:8:49,23 --> 0:8:52,8
Weapons are meant to be controlled in your hands

251
0:8:52,8 --> 0:8:53,48
Like double-handed sticks

252
0:8:53,48 --> 0:8:55,0
Things like a kitchen knife

253
0:8:55,0 --> 0:8:56,46
These items aren't very effective

254
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:57,14
Western-style knives

255
0:8:57,14 --> 0:8:59,22
Japanese-style knives, especially those used for slicing raw fish

256
0:8:59,22 --> 0:9:0,41
are a bit more useful

257
0:9:0,41 --> 0:9:2,97
You can attach them to a long handle

258
0:9:2,97 --> 0:9:5,1
This is for life-saving in critical moments

259
0:9:5,1 --> 0:9:6,49
You shouldn't use it to attack someone

260
0:9:6,49 --> 0:9:7,1
You know that, right?'

261
0:9:7,1 --> 0:9:9,11
So, the longer this thing is

262
0:9:9,11 --> 0:9:10,73
keep your distance from the other person

263
0:9:10,73 --> 0:9:11,91
the safer it is for you

264
0:9:11,91 --> 0:9:13,85
it can also be disguised as a walking stick

265
0:9:13,85 --> 0:9:18,5
or even as a regular cane, which is quite handy

266
0:9:18,5 --> 0:9:19,63
let’s move on

267
0:9:19,63 --> 0:9:21,33
like when I lived in France

268
0:9:21,33 --> 0:9:23,87
I specifically lived in the area between two countries

269
0:9:23,87 --> 0:9:24,87
how should I put it

270
0:9:24,87 --> 0:9:27,7
There are rivers like this along the way

271
0:9:27,7 --> 0:9:28,39
I live by the Marne River

272
0:9:28,39 --> 0:9:31,26
So, in a critical moment, if the ground transportation fails

273
0:9:31,26 --> 0:9:34,42
I can paddle a boat or use a ferry to cross

274
0:9:34,42 --> 0:9:35,94
and slowly make my way to Germany

275
0:9:35,94 --> 0:9:38,49
Back then, the idea was pretty simple

276
0:9:38,49 --> 0:9:39,49
Because where there's a river

277
0:9:39,49 --> 0:9:40,87
it can always ensure passage

278
0:9:40,87 --> 0:9:44,29
since rivers don't experience traffic jams or anything like that

279
0:9:44,29 --> 0:9:46,49
Because you wanted to fly away at the first moment

280
0:9:46,49 --> 0:9:48,5
If that option isn’t available

281
0:9:48,5 --> 0:9:50,82
Try to escape the city as soon as possible.

282
0:9:50,82 --> 0:9:51,77
This is crucial

283
0:9:51,77 --> 0:9:53,47
Head for the countryside

284
0:9:53,47 --> 0:9:56,1
If that’s not feasible, go to the mountains

285
0:9:56,1 --> 0:9:57,89
You can hold out for a long time in the mountains

286
0:9:57,89 --> 0:9:58,89
Stay hidden for a long time

287
0:9:58,89 --> 0:10:0,89
That’s when your wilderness survival skills will come in handy

288
0:10:0,89 --> 0:10:3,49
So it's crucial to develop your survival skills over a certain period of time.

289
0:10:3,49 --> 0:10:4,3
That's really important.

290
0:10:4,3 --> 0:10:5,26
Remember this rule.

291
0:10:5,26 --> 0:10:7,9
First, gather the necessary survival supplies.

292
0:10:7,9 --> 0:10:9,59
Second, travel light.

293
0:10:9,59 --> 0:10:11,71
Leave your valuables behind.

294
0:10:11,71 --> 0:10:12,75
Don't carry them with you.

295
0:10:12,75 --> 0:10:15,69
Unless you have items that have trade value.

296
0:10:15,69 --> 0:10:17,469
And that's how you should handle it in this situation.

297
0:10:17,469 --> 0:10:20,89
Then you need to prepare some personal weapons.

298
0:10:20,89 --> 0:10:21,869
You should have at least two types of weapons.

299
0:10:21,869 --> 0:10:22,429
One long one,

300
0:10:22,429 --> 0:10:23,24
and one short one.

301
0:10:23,24 --> 0:10:25,2
The long one is for engaging in confrontations.

302
0:10:25,2 --> 0:10:26,96
But remember, if you can fight, you fight,

303
0:10:26,96 --> 0:10:27,6
if you can run, you run.

304
0:10:27,6 --> 0:10:29,1
That’s the principle to follow.

305
0:10:29,1 --> 0:10:30,29
In principle,

306
0:10:30,29 --> 0:10:31,77
If you're not alone

307
0:10:31,77 --> 0:10:32,81
If you have women and children with you

308
0:10:32,81 --> 0:10:34,1
Try to help them disguise themselves

309
0:10:34,1 --> 0:10:35,25
This is very important

310
0:10:35,25 --> 0:10:36,4
This won't be a primary target for the robber

311
0:10:36,4 --> 0:10:38,6
It's not a crucial objective

312
0:10:38,6 --> 0:10:39,6
The most critical thing is

313
0:10:39,6 --> 0:10:41,2
I think listening to this one sentence in the video is enough

314
0:10:41,2 --> 0:10:44,25
I think you should listen to this one sentence from the video, and that would be enough.

315
0:10:44,25 --> 0:10:46,49
After four in the evening

316
0:10:46,49 --> 0:10:49,81
to around seven or eight in the morning is the best time for movement during the day

317
0:10:49,81 --> 0:10:52,829
it’s best to move between shelters

318
0:10:52,829 --> 0:10:54,609
or run out of the city in one go

319
0:10:54,609 --> 0:10:57,4
this way, it’s relatively safer

320
0:10:57,4 --> 0:10:58,8
anyway

321
0:10:58,8 --> 0:11:0,44
prepare food and water for four to eight days

322
0:11:0,44 --> 0:11:3,13
you should always have an emergency kit on hand

323
0:11:3,13 --> 0:11:4,37
most importantly

324
0:11:4,37 --> 0:11:5,13
For Chinese people,

325
0:11:5,13 --> 0:11:5,61
let me tell you,

326
0:11:5,61 --> 0:11:7,27
it’s important not to flaunt your wealth when you’re abroad.

327
0:11:7,27 --> 0:11:8,89
Many girls take photos,

328
0:11:8,89 --> 0:11:10,54
showing off all sorts of things they have.

329
0:11:10,54 --> 0:11:13,2
Actually, this is something that happens a lot overseas,

330
0:11:13,2 --> 0:11:14,58
why girls are particularly vulnerable to being robbed,

331
0:11:14,58 --> 0:11:14,92
or stolen from,

332
0:11:14,92 --> 0:11:16,569
is because they stand out too much.

333
0:11:16,569 --> 0:11:18,129
You guys really love taking photos and checking in.

334
0:11:18,129 --> 0:11:20,129
You're always showing off how good-looking you are.

335
0:11:20,129 --> 0:11:21,729
So this makes you a prime target for thieves.

336
0:11:21,729 --> 0:11:24,47
And for robbers as well.

337
0:11:26,75 --> 0:11:28,75
Actually, in many cases,

338
0:11:28,75 --> 0:11:32,27
things have already descended into anarchy.

339
0:11:32,27 --> 0:11:33,98
It's at these moments when it's particularly easy

340
0:11:33,98 --> 0:11:36,2
to think everything is fine one second,

341
0:11:36,2 --> 0:11:38,14
only to face all sorts of violent crimes the next.

342
0:11:38,14 --> 0:11:41,31
So, don't get involved in such things first.

343
0:11:41,31 --> 0:11:42,55
Second, when you encounter such situations,

344
0:11:42,55 --> 0:11:43,65
try to stay as far away as possible.

345
0:11:43,65 --> 0:11:45,81
Third, try to escape from this place,

346
0:11:45,81 --> 0:11:48,7
like this chaotic city,

347
0:11:48,7 --> 0:11:50,42
escape to the suburbs first,

348
0:11:50,42 --> 0:11:51,14
get to the suburbs first,

349
0:11:51,14 --> 0:11:52,66
then move to a much farther location.

350
0:11:52,66 --> 0:11:54,1
So, at this point, we're talking about

351
0:11:54,1 --> 0:11:56,2
It's important to train yourself regularly.

352
0:11:56,2 --> 0:11:58,59
At the very least, you should learn how to drive a car.

353
0:11:58,59 --> 0:11:59,75
Driving a car is preferable.

354
0:11:59,75 --> 0:12:1,11
It's also great if you can ride a motorcycle.

355
0:12:1,11 --> 0:12:2,39
Being able to operate a yacht is useful too.

356
0:12:2,39 --> 0:12:4,3
You should also be able to handle a speedboat.

357
0:12:4,3 --> 0:12:7,57
At the very minimum, you should know how to ride a bicycle.

358
0:12:7,57 --> 0:12:10,4
Choosing the right time to travel is crucial.

359
0:12:10,4 --> 0:12:13,64
Traveling before 12 PM is generally safer.

360
0:12:13,64 --> 0:12:14,96
From noon to afternoon

361
0:12:14,96 --> 0:12:17,55
Especially in the early part of the night, it's the most chaotic time

362
0:12:17,55 --> 0:12:19,75
So, during this time, you need to remember

363
0:12:19,75 --> 0:12:20,75
No matter what

364
0:12:20,75 --> 0:12:21,41
Your safety comes first

365
0:12:21,41 --> 0:12:23,37
If you need to, be willing to let go of your money

366
0:12:23,37 --> 0:12:26,38
Before it all starts

367
0:12:26,38 --> 0:12:27,58
Before the power cuts begin

368
0:12:27,58 --> 0:12:29,8
Try to withdraw as much cash as possible

369
0:12:29,8 --> 0:12:32,31
It’s best to carry items worth a few thousand yuan on you.

370
0:12:32,31 --> 0:12:34,93
This kind of Chinese currency can be used for trade.

371
0:12:34,93 --> 0:12:35,55
In that case,

372
0:12:35,55 --> 0:12:37,66
salt, fuel,

373
0:12:37,66 --> 0:12:38,18
food,

374
0:12:38,18 --> 0:12:38,64
water,

375
0:12:38,64 --> 0:12:39,44
medicines, and such

376
0:12:39,44 --> 0:12:40,28
when it comes to a critical moment,

377
0:12:40,28 --> 0:12:41,48
if you really can’t escape

378
0:12:41,48 --> 0:12:43,599
Like the siege of Sarajevo that lasted for four years

379
0:12:43,599 --> 0:12:44,719
At that time, you needed

380
0:12:44,719 --> 0:12:47,159
to have a great deal of wisdom to survive

381
0:12:47,159 --> 0:12:47,679
But to speak of it

382
0:12:47,679 --> 0:12:49,9
I think that as Chinese people today

383
0:12:49,9 --> 0:12:50,5
we don’t need to worry

384
0:12:50,5 --> 0:12:52,38
because our country will organize an evacuation

385
0:12:52,38 --> 0:12:54,34
Secondly, for crucial issues

386
0:12:54,34 --> 0:12:57,28
I suggest you don’t go to dangerous places

387
0:12:57,28 --> 0:12:59,32
So, I hope everyone, no matter what,

388
0:12:59,32 --> 0:13:1,24
People traveling in America now

389
0:13:1,24 --> 0:13:3,42
try to avoid these major cities,

390
0:13:3,42 --> 0:13:5,36
and figure out a way,

391
0:13:5,36 --> 0:13:8,64
like transferring into Canada first,

392
0:13:8,64 --> 0:13:9,88
and then returning home,

393
0:13:9,88 --> 0:13:10,72
no matter what,

394
0:13:10,72 --> 0:13:12,93
I hope you are staying safe in North America now,

395
0:13:12,93 --> 0:13:14,81
and there's no need to be overly worried.

396
0:13:14,81 --> 0:13:17,97
Because in many cities, we often see such incidents.

397
0:13:17,97 --> 0:13:21,339
But the question is whether it will escalate to that extent.

398
0:13:21,339 --> 0:13:23,259
Like the major riots in Los Angeles in the 1980s.

399
0:13:23,259 --> 0:13:24,139
That's really hard to say.

400
0:13:24,139 --> 0:13:27,54
If another disaster were to strike Los Angeles at this time,

401
0:13:27,54 --> 0:13:30,74
it would certainly increase the complexity of disaster relief and various other challenges.

402
0:13:30,74 --> 0:13:32,14
We all know about the floods in Florida.

403
0:13:32,14 --> 0:13:34,86
Back then, Miami and other places also experienced riots.

404
0:13:34,86 --> 0:13:38,96
This is actually why there's a difference in thinking between foreign and domestic perspectives.

405
0:13:38,96 --> 0:13:40,18
It's completely different, though.

406
0:13:40,18 --> 0:13:42,76
Because once people fall into this state,

407
0:13:42,76 --> 0:13:44,4
anyone can become an attacker,

408
0:13:44,4 --> 0:13:45,8
a criminal.

409
0:13:45,8 --> 0:13:47,24
They don’t have the same moral awareness as we do,

410
0:13:47,24 --> 0:13:49,6
nor do they have our organizational skills in society.

411
0:13:49,6 --> 0:13:51,19
So for these people,

412
0:13:51,19 --> 0:13:52,71
don’t trust anyone,

413
0:13:52,71 --> 0:13:54,21
anyone could be a beast in the flood.

414
0:13:54,21 --> 0:13:56,25
In a nutshell, zombie games

415
0:13:56,25 --> 0:13:57,88
Exactly

416
0:13:57,88 --> 0:14:0,56
are a form of mental training for everyday people

417
0:14:0,56 --> 0:14:1,54
a kind of rehearsal

418
0:14:1,54 --> 0:14:4,2
because we can't constantly show scenes of violence

419
0:14:4,2 --> 0:14:6,42
so the idea is that people turn into zombies

420
0:14:10,7 --> 0:14:13,98
so I hope everyone can pick up some survival knowledge

421
0:14:13,98 --> 0:14:15,22
I haven't really said much

422
0:14:15,22 --> 0:14:16,86
but the key is in the details

423
0:14:16,86 --> 0:14:18,88
Actually, it's about the handbook for military and civilian dual-use talents

424
0:14:18,88 --> 0:14:20,22
or the doctor's handbook

425
0:14:20,22 --> 0:14:22,639
or the urban survival guide

426
0:14:22,639 --> 0:14:23,719
or the wilderness survival manual

427
0:14:23,719 --> 0:14:24,839
all sorts of things like that

428
0:14:24,839 --> 0:14:26,319
and there are those preppers

429
0:14:26,319 --> 0:14:27,61
survival enthusiasts and the like

430
0:14:27,61 --> 0:14:28,93
this kind of hobbyists

431
0:14:28,93 --> 0:14:31,77
they can actually provide you with more detailed information

432
0:14:31,77 --> 0:14:33,64
Let me mention a few key points.

433
0:14:33,64 --> 0:14:34,88
I also talked about bulletproofing.

434
0:14:34,88 --> 0:14:37,18
The most important aspect of bulletproofing is protection against

435
0:14:37,18 --> 0:14:38,16
grenade launchers,

436
0:14:38,16 --> 0:14:39,72
rubber bullets,

437
0:14:39,72 --> 0:14:40,8
and tear gas.

438
0:14:40,8 --> 0:14:42,28
If you're the one explaining it,

439
0:14:42,28 --> 0:14:47,1
it's about having simple disaster-resistant escape tools.

440
0:14:47,1 --> 0:14:49,41
A fire mask is something you should definitely have.

441
0:14:49,41 --> 0:14:51,77
And if you can get a fire suit,

442
0:14:51,77 --> 0:14:54,1
its protective capabilities are excellent.

443
0:14:54,1 --> 0:14:57,59
If you have a fire extinguisher at home,

444
0:14:57,59 --> 0:14:59,15
make sure to keep it in good condition.

445
0:14:59,15 --> 0:15:1,77
A fire extinguisher is also a very useful

446
0:15:1,77 --> 0:15:3,35
self-defense tool.

447
0:15:3,35 --> 0:15:7,88
It can prevent you from engaging in intense physical altercations.

448
0:15:7,88 --> 0:15:8,72
Regardless,

449
0:15:8,72 --> 0:15:9,8
I hope everyone stays safe.

450
0:15:9,8 --> 0:15:12,26
Life and survival are not games.

451
0:15:12,26 --> 0:15:14,84
Often, it's a matter of life and death.

452
0:15:14,84 --> 0:15:16,12
It's not something to take lightly.

453
0:15:16,12 --> 0:15:16,96
Speaking for myself,

454
0:15:16,96 --> 0:15:19,9
I've encountered such incidents two or three times while studying abroad.

455
0:15:19,9 --> 0:15:20,5
These kinds of situations,

456
0:15:20,5 --> 0:15:22,96
having the right equipment can reduce fear,

457
0:15:22,96 --> 0:15:23,88
but there's no need to overprepare and feel like the fourth natural disaster is coming,

458
0:15:23,88 --> 0:15:26,76
or that the Three-Body people are about to attack.

459
0:15:26,76 --> 0:15:30,5
You might prepare a lot,

460
0:15:30,5 --> 0:15:31,53
but it might not be useful in the end.

461
0:15:31,53 --> 0:15:32,59
It could be a skill that's never used,

462
0:15:32,59 --> 0:15:33,83
so it's not very practical.

463
0:15:33,83 --> 0:15:35,39
However, to some extent,

464
0:15:35,39 --> 0:15:36,75
everyone should prepare survival skills in advance.

465
0:15:36,75 --> 0:15:38,55
I always recommend that if there are any signs of trouble,

466
0:15:38,55 --> 0:15:40,35
escape as soon as possible.

467
0:15:40,35 --> 0:15:43,79
Get to a safe area as quickly as you can,

468
0:15:43,79 --> 0:15:45,7
Run away as soon as possible

469
0:15:45,7 --> 0:15:45,79
Escape at the first opportunity

470
0:15:45,79 --> 0:15:46,75
I hope everyone lives a life free from disasters,

471
0:15:46,75 --> 0:15:47,91
and never encounters famine,

472
0:15:47,91 --> 0:15:49,11
or war,

473
0:15:49,11 --> 0:15:52,42
or all kinds of trouble.

474
0:15:52,42 --> 0:15:53,86
We should avoid getting involved in such matters.

475
0:15:53,86 --> 0:15:55,26
I wish everyone a lifetime of peace and safety.

476
0:15:55,26 --> 0:15:57,17
These tools are for saving lives in critical moments,

477
0:15:57,17 --> 0:15:59,35
but I hope we can live in a very peaceful and stable environment,
