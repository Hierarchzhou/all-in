0:0:0,58 --> 0:0:3,16
I hope you favorite this video right now

2
0:0:3,16 --> 0:0:6,48
and then whenever you feel down in the future, take a look at it

3
0:0:6,48 --> 0:0:8,62
I used to really not understand

4
0:0:8,62 --> 0:0:12,49
why so many people in the world live in pain

5
0:0:12,49 --> 0:0:13,71
and suffer a lot

6
0:0:13,71 --> 0:0:15,25
but later on, I realized

7
0:0:15,25 --> 0:0:20,44
that I had received so much encouragement and love from a young age

8
0:0:20,44 --> 0:0:23,26
so my love just overflowed

9
0:0:23,26 --> 0:0:27,85
which is why I was able to stay positive even when my life situations became really tough later on

10
0:0:27,85 --> 0:0:31,69
I still feel that destiny is so clear.

11
0:0:31,69 --> 0:0:34,47
I feel particularly encouraged.

12
0:0:34,47 --> 0:0:38,31
I believe I can definitely get out of this predicament.

13
0:0:38,31 --> 0:0:40,7
I can definitely save myself.

14
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:42,34
But is it all my doing?

15
0:0:42,34 --> 0:0:43,38
My family

16
0:0:43,38 --> 0:0:44,18
My friends

17
0:0:44,18 --> 0:0:45,36
My mentors

18
0:0:45,36 --> 0:0:48,76
All these people have given me positive encouragement.

19
0:0:48,76 --> 0:0:52,57
But you'll find that life, in many ways, is about

20
0:0:52,57 --> 0:0:54,41
when you truly need someone's help,

21
0:0:54,41 --> 0:0:55,57
you don't get it.

22
0:0:55,57 --> 0:0:58,66
Why is there such a big difference between people?

23
0:0:58,66 --> 0:1:2,629
It's because we all have different experiences and feelings.

24
0:1:2,629 --> 0:1:5,489
But life doesn't give you a second chance to start over.

25
0:1:5,489 --> 0:1:7,24
So what are you going to do?

26
0:1:7,24 --> 0:1:9,96
The meaning of life, as I see it,

27
0:1:9,96 --> 0:1:13,16
lies in intense self-deception.

28
0:1:13,84 --> 0:1:16,66
This world is inherently virtual

29
0:1:16,66 --> 0:1:19,16
Our planet operates within this universe

30
0:1:19,16 --> 0:1:20,48
which is an extremely rare event

31
0:1:20,48 --> 0:1:24,89
So a lot of things are a matter of mind over matter

32
0:1:24,89 --> 0:1:25,589
If I had such an experience

33
0:1:25,589 --> 0:1:28,89
it would make my body feel quite joyful

34
0:1:28,89 --> 0:1:29,369
giving me a lot of positive feedback

35
0:1:29,369 --> 0:1:30,65
So if you think the same way

36
0:1:30,65 --> 0:1:32,13
you can also attain these things

37
0:1:32,13 --> 0:1:34,39
It's about reprogramming yourself

38
0:1:34,39 --> 0:1:37,939
First, you need to understand that you are incredibly valuable

39
0:1:37,939 --> 0:1:38,519
You can't do it

40
0:1:38,519 --> 0:1:39,399
I'll rewire your thinking

41
0:1:39,399 --> 0:1:39,839
It's okay

42
0:1:39,839 --> 0:1:41,84
Just hand over your mind to me for a moment

43
0:1:41,84 --> 0:1:43,6
Let's see why you are valuable

44
0:1:43,6 --> 0:1:45,0
First, come over here and look

45
0:1:45,0 --> 0:1:47,68
You belong to the top 6.5 percent in China

46
0:1:47,68 --> 0:1:49,24
And you are among the top 650

47
0:1:49,24 --> 0:1:50,12
Are you the last one?

48
0:1:50,12 --> 0:1:51,39
You're not

49
0:1:51,39 --> 0:1:53,119
And you've successfully made it this far

50
0:1:53,119 --> 0:1:55,959
So why does this pessimism insist on belittling you?

51
0:1:55,959 --> 0:1:57,94
He says he always hopes you will improve

52
0:1:57,94 --> 0:2:0,84
But in reality, people can't always be put down

53
0:2:0,84 --> 0:2:2,58
Can't always be pessimistic

54
0:2:2,58 --> 0:2:4,46
Then after you filter through people

55
0:2:4,46 --> 0:2:5,68
You need to treat people as they are.

56
0:2:5,68 --> 0:2:7,36
You need to communicate with others.

57
0:2:7,36 --> 0:2:9,2
Actually, scoring 94 is also great.

58
0:2:9,2 --> 0:2:10,69
Not getting a perfect score is also fine.

59
0:2:10,69 --> 0:2:13,75
This world isn't just for those who score 100.

60
0:2:13,75 --> 0:2:15,36
So many parents,

61
0:2:15,36 --> 0:2:17,9
their families of origin are pretty messed up,

62
0:2:17,9 --> 0:2:20,79
and haven't given them much encouragement.

63
0:2:20,79 --> 0:2:21,999
They are just conditioning their own children.

64
0:2:21,999 --> 0:2:23,59
Playing the Confucian game

65
0:2:23,59 --> 0:2:24,399
My own level isn't high

66
0:2:24,399 --> 0:2:25,659
Yet I still try to mold others

67
0:2:25,659 --> 0:2:28,74
That's why many people suffer

68
0:2:28,74 --> 0:2:31,6
Just because they live in an East Asian society

69
0:2:31,6 --> 0:2:34,11
It leads to the creation of many hollow individuals

70
0:2:34,11 --> 0:2:35,63
There's no way around it

71
0:2:35,63 --> 0:2:38,74
But the education I received from my family was completely different

72
0:2:38,74 --> 0:2:39,66
So let me tell you

73
0:2:39,66 --> 0:2:41,54
Different families can be so different.

74
0:2:41,54 --> 0:2:43,18
Happy families are all alike.

75
0:2:43,18 --> 0:2:44,91
Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

76
0:2:44,91 --> 0:2:45,95
So, friends,

77
0:2:45,95 --> 0:2:46,43
Comrades,

78
0:2:46,43 --> 0:2:47,73
Just think about it,

79
0:2:47,73 --> 0:2:49,47
You call me Cyber Godfather,

80
0:2:49,47 --> 0:2:50,67
I can't just let you call me that for nothing,

81
0:2:50,67 --> 0:2:51,399
Right?

82
0:2:51,399 --> 0:2:52,899
First, you need to understand

83
0:2:52,899 --> 0:2:54,119
in this universe

84
0:2:54,119 --> 0:2:56,99
the probability of a life being born is extremely low

85
0:2:56,99 --> 0:2:58,45
your existence

86
0:2:58,45 --> 0:3:1,95
being born into this world is a very rare occurrence

87
0:3:1,95 --> 0:3:4,1
your universe begins with you

88
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:5,33
and ends with you

89
0:3:5,33 --> 0:3:6,75
if you feel unhappy

90
0:3:6,75 --> 0:3:7,89
if you want to start over

91
0:3:7,89 --> 0:3:9,55
This universe would have no meaning.

92
0:3:9,55 --> 0:3:11,5
All of this would be meaningless to you.

93
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:13,3
So, you are the master of everything.

94
0:3:13,3 --> 0:3:15,15
This is the second person, to begin with.

95
0:3:15,15 --> 0:3:16,71
As long as you're alive, there is meaning.

96
0:3:16,71 --> 0:3:18,75
The meaning of life is something you give to yourself.

97
0:3:18,75 --> 0:3:20,16
As long as you're alive, there is meaning.

98
0:3:20,16 --> 0:3:21,94
So, you are inherently good.

99
0:3:21,94 --> 0:3:24,16
It's not about what you do being good.

100
0:3:24,16 --> 0:3:25,96
It's not about doing something great

101
0:3:25,96 --> 0:3:27,329
and then getting some result

102
0:3:27,329 --> 0:3:28,449
Being alive

103
0:3:28,449 --> 0:3:30,29
human existence itself

104
0:3:30,29 --> 0:3:31,129
is a wonderful thing

105
0:3:31,129 --> 0:3:32,529
you live in this world

106
0:3:32,529 --> 0:3:33,86
you pay to breathe

107
0:3:33,86 --> 0:3:36,2
you walk among people

108
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:37,38
you are creating value

109
0:3:37,38 --> 0:3:39,1
You're also creating fertilizer when you poop.

110
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:40,4
So, it's important to think this way.

111
0:3:40,4 --> 0:3:43,28
You must never think that your life is useless.

112
0:3:43,28 --> 0:3:45,12
How could your life possibly be without value?

113
0:3:45,12 --> 0:3:46,72
Perhaps you were mass-produced.

114
0:3:46,72 --> 0:3:50,4
Maybe you've received very little love throughout your life.

115
0:3:50,4 --> 0:3:51,48
Then give it to yourself.

116
0:3:51,48 --> 0:3:53,959
Let's strengthen ourselves.

117
0:3:53,959 --> 0:3:56,939
Transform yourself into a state of self-sufficiency.

118
0:3:56,939 --> 0:3:58,39
Often, we can

119
0:3:58,39 --> 0:4:0,459
find some books on humanities and social sciences to read

120
0:4:0,459 --> 0:4:3,99
and gradually arm ourselves with Adlerian psychology

121
0:4:3,99 --> 0:4:4,359
don't be sad

122
0:4:4,359 --> 0:4:8,89
don't waste time being sad about anything

123
0:4:8,89 --> 0:4:10,849
you'll find that the things you lacked in childhood

124
0:4:10,849 --> 0:4:13,9
can all be found in books

125
0:4:13,9 --> 0:4:14,39
truly enriching yourself

126
0:4:14,39 --> 0:4:16,63
I think you're very happy now

127
0:4:16,63 --> 0:4:18,19
Then you can truly be happy

128
0:4:18,19 --> 0:4:19,13
There are many times

129
0:4:19,13 --> 0:4:21,73
That's why I say learning acting is particularly interesting

130
0:4:21,73 --> 0:4:24,689
It's about saying if you can do it, you can do it

131
0:4:24,689 --> 0:4:25,989
Even if you can't, it's still fine

132
0:4:25,989 --> 0:4:27,809
If they say you can't, then you can't

133
0:4:27,809 --> 0:4:28,769
Even if you can, it's still not good enough

134
0:4:28,769 --> 0:4:31,1
People sometimes in that moment

135
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:32,98
Whether this life is painful or not

136
0:4:32,98 --> 0:4:34,18
It's all up to your parents

137
0:4:34,18 --> 0:4:36,36
and a word from your elementary school teacher

138
0:4:36,36 --> 0:4:38,22
so let's turn it around for you now

139
0:4:38,22 --> 0:4:41,2
let's straighten out all the things that have been twisted

140
0:4:41,2 --> 0:4:42,84
won't that solve the problem?

141
0:4:42,84 --> 0:4:45,2
give yourself a fresh system reboot

142
0:4:45,2 --> 0:4:46,38
reprogram your mind

143
0:4:46,38 --> 0:4:47,48
don't find it troublesome

144
0:4:47,48 --> 0:4:48,6
don't think it's too painful

145
0:4:48,6 --> 0:4:49,6
These things, you know,

146
0:4:49,6 --> 0:4:53,59
have always been naturally present.

147
0:4:53,59 --> 0:4:55,61
You were already living a great life,

148
0:4:55,61 --> 0:4:57,19
and what you did was truly remarkable.

149
0:4:57,19 --> 0:4:58,88
In what you're doing now,

150
0:4:58,88 --> 0:5:0,32
either it leads to success,

151
0:5:0,32 --> 0:5:1,72
or there are some setbacks,

152
0:5:1,72 --> 0:5:2,52
some other things,

153
0:5:2,52 --> 0:5:5,289
because you have something better waiting for you.

154
0:5:5,289 --> 0:5:7,649
Your existence is a miracle.

155
0:5:7,649 --> 0:5:10,38
Your life is bound to be a legend.

156
0:5:10,38 --> 0:5:13,14
You can't see your life clearly right now.

157
0:5:13,14 --> 0:5:14,14
What kind of life it is.

158
0:5:14,14 --> 0:5:15,74
I didn't have a turn of luck until I was 37.

159
0:5:15,74 --> 0:5:17,22
Does that mean I have to wait until I'm 36 or 35?

160
0:5:17,22 --> 0:5:17,66
34?

161
0:5:17,66 --> 0:5:19,229
Or even 33?

162
0:5:19,229 --> 0:5:21,249
The numbers from 27 to 28 are all mixed up.

163
0:5:21,249 --> 0:5:22,849
Does this life have no meaning at all?

164
0:5:22,849 --> 0:5:27,44
Isn't it true that every day, every minute, every second makes up who I am at 37?

165
0:5:27,44 --> 0:5:28,88
Am I not living at 37?

166
0:5:28,88 --> 0:5:29,52
There's still 38,

167
0:5:29,52 --> 0:5:30,5
39, 40,

168
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:33,18
So it doesn’t matter which stop this journey of life reaches,

169
0:5:33,18 --> 0:5:34,97
We will all eventually reach our destination.

170
0:5:34,97 --> 0:5:36,57
No matter how we look at it,

171
0:5:36,57 --> 0:5:38,25
Let's support each other.

172
0:5:38,25 --> 0:5:40,17
Our biological families might not be great

173
0:5:40,17 --> 0:5:42,92
but our cyber family can support each other

174
0:5:42,92 --> 0:5:43,84
My videos

175
0:5:43,84 --> 0:5:46,2
to be honest, are quite powerful

176
0:5:46,2 --> 0:5:47,68
take your time to watch and absorb

177
0:5:47,68 --> 0:5:48,36
and slowly digest

178
0:5:48,36 --> 0:5:51,789
we'll gradually overcome those past toxic influences

179
0:5:51,789 --> 0:5:54,69
those Confucian, paternalistic

180
0:5:54,69 --> 0:5:55,149
East Asian-style monster rooms

181
0:5:55,149 --> 0:5:59,5
That kind of superior education that suppresses individuals

182
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:2,77
The Prussian method of cultivating people

183
0:6:2,77 --> 0:6:5,1
That way of belittling others

184
0:6:5,1 --> 0:6:7,33
That kind of pressure on individuals within collectivism

185
0:6:7,33 --> 0:6:9,97
Release all the emotional oppression

186
0:6:9,97 --> 0:6:11,5
It's fine

187
0:6:11,5 --> 0:6:12,19
You can definitely do it

188
0:6:12,19 --> 0:6:13,23
You didn't do well

189
0:6:13,23 --> 0:6:14,37
This is a lifetime

190
0:6:14,37 --> 0:6:15,9
You might not do well

191
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:17,659
but no one will come to blame you

192
0:6:17,659 --> 0:6:19,619
so your life has always had meaning

193
0:6:19,619 --> 0:6:20,859
your sole purpose

194
0:6:20,859 --> 0:6:23,979
is to experience joy in this world

195
0:6:23,979 --> 0:6:26,86
there's still so much joy left to experience

196
0:6:26,86 --> 0:6:28,64
the joy that Dad feels, you can't experience

197
0:6:28,64 --> 0:6:30,44
so there's still a lot of joy for you to experience

198
0:6:30,44 --> 0:6:34,9
you're here to work happily

199
0:6:34,9 --> 0:6:36,25
You need to achieve good results in what you do.

200
0:6:36,25 --> 0:6:38,93
These aren't things you were born to do.

201
0:6:38,93 --> 0:6:41,29
You were naturally meant to drop out.

202
0:6:41,29 --> 0:6:44,47
What you truly need is sunshine, water, air, and sleep.

203
0:6:44,47 --> 0:6:46,98
And of course.

204
0:6:46,98 --> 0:6:48,58
And that handsome guy.

205
0:6:48,58 --> 0:6:49,26
Just these things.

206
0:6:49,26 --> 0:6:50,98
These are the things you need.

207
0:6:50,98 --> 0:6:52,82
These are the things you truly need.

208
0:6:52,82 --> 0:6:53,9
I can't live without these things anyway

209
0:6:53,9 --> 0:6:54,78
I just can't survive

210
0:6:54,78 --> 0:6:55,48
You know that

211
0:6:55,48 --> 0:6:58,0
These are the things truly needed for life

212
0:6:58,0 --> 0:6:59,84
What you need is praise from others

213
0:6:59,84 --> 0:7:0,64
Encouragement from others

214
0:7:0,64 --> 0:7:2,49
Just like what I'm giving you now

215
0:7:2,49 --> 0:7:5,33
You are a great person in and of yourself

216
0:7:5,33 --> 0:7:6,21
You are capable of living

217
0:7:6,21 --> 0:7:6,81
Being able to breathe

218
0:7:6,81 --> 0:7:8,69
Being able to exist is already being a good person

219
0:7:8,69 --> 0:7:11,669
It's not about what you have or haven't done

220
0:7:11,669 --> 0:7:13,289
What you have or haven't bought

221
0:7:13,289 --> 0:7:14,349
Whether you've passed the civil service exam or not

222
0:7:14,349 --> 0:7:14,529
Whether you've

223
0:7:14,529 --> 0:7:15,169
failed the postgraduate exam or not

224
0:7:15,169 --> 0:7:16,409
These things don't matter

225
0:7:16,409 --> 0:7:17,49
As long as you're alive

226
0:7:17,49 --> 0:7:18,3
It's all good as long as we're alive

227
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:19,48
As long as we're alive, that's what matters

228
0:7:19,48 --> 0:7:20,98
Even if we die, we would still be heroes

229
0:7:20,98 --> 0:7:21,5
After we're gone

230
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:23,909
We would have lived our lives to the fullest

231
0:7:23,909 --> 0:7:25,469
So life is a journey

232
0:7:25,469 --> 0:7:26,349
It's an experience

233
0:7:26,349 --> 0:7:27,809
It's nothing else

234
0:7:27,809 --> 0:7:29,469
You can make it whatever you want it to be

235
0:7:29,469 --> 0:7:30,69
He is nothing

236
0:7:30,69 --> 0:7:32,6
Because you are the Creator

237
0:7:32,6 --> 0:7:34,14
In your universe, you are

238
0:7:34,14 --> 0:7:35,6
You are the Creator

239
0:7:35,6 --> 0:7:38,15
Because you are both the Omega and the Alpha

240
0:7:38,15 --> 0:7:39,27
You are the end of all things

241
0:7:39,27 --> 0:7:40,35
And the beginning of all things

242
0:7:40,35 --> 0:7:44,43
So everything is up to you

243
0:7:44,43 --> 0:7:46,3
You are not an NPC

244
0:7:46,3 --> 0:7:47,3
You are the world.

245
0:7:47,3 --> 0:7:48,31
One day, after you awaken,

246
0:7:48,31 --> 0:7:51,4
you will be the main character of this world.

247
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:52,68
A true and real protagonist.

248
0:7:52,68 --> 0:7:54,0
So I'm telling you,

249
0:7:54,0 --> 0:7:55,2
if your child is in great pain,

250
0:7:55,2 --> 0:7:56,289
what are you watching now?

251
0:7:56,289 --> 0:7:57,509
You can watch my videos,

252
0:7:57,509 --> 0:7:58,529
but more importantly,

253
0:7:58,529 --> 0:8:0,409
I hope you explore more areas,

254
0:8:0,409 --> 0:8:1,91
books on humanities and social sciences,

255
0:8:1,91 --> 0:8:2,91
psychology,

256
0:8:2,91 --> 0:8:3,67
social psychology,

257
0:8:3,67 --> 0:8:4,15
sociology,

258
0:8:4,15 --> 0:8:4,63
historiography,

259
0:8:4,63 --> 0:8:4,99
political science,

260
0:8:4,99 --> 0:8:6,37
take a look at all of them,

261
0:8:6,37 --> 0:8:8,77
and you'll find a lot of benefits yourself.

262
0:8:8,77 --> 0:8:10,43
It's not useless at all.

263
0:8:10,43 --> 0:8:12,95
The most important thing in life is to deceive yourself.

264
0:8:12,95 --> 0:8:14,5
To love dreaming.

265
0:8:14,5 --> 0:8:15,61
And to have dreams.

266
0:8:15,61 --> 0:8:18,3
To make yourself feel really good.

267
0:8:18,3 --> 0:8:20,7
Although the material conditions might not be particularly good right now,

268
0:8:20,7 --> 0:8:22,9
We can be spiritually rich.

269
0:8:22,9 --> 0:8:24,2
We can have faith.

270
0:8:24,2 --> 0:8:25,8
That's how it is.

271
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:26,28
So when you have faith,

272
0:8:26,28 --> 0:8:27,34
You also have strength.

273
0:8:27,34 --> 0:8:28,4
What is my faith?

274
0:8:28,4 --> 0:8:30,94
Sunlight, water, and air—just that simple.

275
0:8:30,94 --> 0:8:33,16
The visual novels I bought on Steam.

276
0:8:33,16 --> 0:8:34,92
It's just that simple for me.

277
0:8:34,92 --> 0:8:37,5
I'm happy as long as I see a beautiful woman.

278
0:8:37,5 --> 0:8:39,24
This is the meaning of my life.

279
0:8:39,24 --> 0:8:41,0
It's about adding little sisters on WeChat.

280
0:8:41,0 --> 0:8:42,8
I'm just a very ordinary person.

281
0:8:42,8 --> 0:8:44,4
That's who I am.

282
0:8:44,4 --> 0:8:44,8
I'm 40 years old,

283
0:8:44,8 --> 0:8:45,48
And I'm still like this.

284
0:8:45,48 --> 0:8:47,66
I'll be 88 and still like this.

285
0:8:47,66 --> 0:8:48,92
Because this is me.

286
0:8:48,92 --> 0:8:50,82
This is the path of my life.

287
0:8:50,82 --> 0:8:51,46
Why?

288
0:8:51,46 --> 0:8:54,14
Because this path is easy to achieve.

289
0:8:54,18 --> 0:8:55,38
It's just that simple.

290
0:8:55,38 --> 0:8:56,62
So no matter what,

291
0:8:56,62 --> 0:8:58,26
No matter how you want to live your life,

292
0:8:58,26 --> 0:8:59,96
Remember, you are the master of your life.

293
0:8:59,96 --> 0:9:1,24
As long as you're happy, that's all that matters.
