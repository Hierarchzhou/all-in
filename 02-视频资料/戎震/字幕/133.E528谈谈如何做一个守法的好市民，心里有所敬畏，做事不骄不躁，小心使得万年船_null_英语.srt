1
0:0:0,64 --> 0:0:3,9
I have no idea how many episodes the mattress 520 has.

2
0:0:3,9 --> 0:0:7,2
Lately, a lot of people have been tagging me in the comments.

3
0:0:7,2 --> 0:0:10,6
They want me to talk about the Datong, Shanxi incident.

4
0:0:10,6 --> 0:0:12,54
But I don’t plan to discuss it.

5
0:0:12,54 --> 0:0:14,26
Why don’t I plan to talk about it?

6
0:0:14,26 --> 0:0:16,6
Because over the past couple of days, I’ve seen many bloggers

7
0:0:16,6 --> 0:0:17,24
talking about this incident.

8
0:0:17,24 --> 0:0:18,78
They’re all riding the wave of this traffic.

9
0:0:18,78 --> 0:0:23,279
Many people are spreading their opinions on this.

10
0:0:23,279 --> 0:0:25,879
It leads to another level

11
0:0:25,879 --> 0:0:28,25
the issue of gender opposition

12
0:0:28,25 --> 0:0:30,61
as a positive influencer

13
0:0:30,61 --> 0:0:32,11
I don’t intend to

14
0:0:32,11 --> 0:0:35,6
stir up and exacerbate the topic

15
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:38,26
today I will only discuss how an individual in society

16
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:41,78
should know and abide by the law

17
0:0:41,78 --> 0:0:44,38
how to uphold the law while being aware of it

18
0:0:44,38 --> 0:0:45,73
and how to promote legal awareness

19
0:0:45,73 --> 0:0:47,41
We need to respect the law.

20
0:0:47,41 --> 0:0:48,33
Respect the facts.

21
0:0:50,11 --> 0:0:52,17
On this basis,

22
0:0:52,17 --> 0:0:53,55
How can we protect ourselves?

23
0:0:53,55 --> 0:0:55,77
As a person in the real world,

24
0:0:55,77 --> 0:0:57,5
How can we protect ourselves?

25
0:0:57,5 --> 0:0:59,5
When I was 12 years old,

26
0:0:59,5 --> 0:1:3,85
My parents took me to Xidan Book Building,

27
0:1:3,85 --> 0:1:5,67
And bought two books.

28
0:1:8,98 --> 0:1:11,54
This book is a bit thinner than the first one.

29
0:1:14,43 --> 0:1:16,25
I hadn't started looking at civil law back then.

30
0:1:16,25 --> 0:1:18,5
Later, I read civil law, contract law, and so on.

31
0:1:18,5 --> 0:1:21,2
But criminal law was the first thing I needed to look at.

32
0:1:21,2 --> 0:1:22,92
Because I was about to start middle school.

33
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:26,66
At the time, I didn't understand the significance of what my parents were doing.

34
0:1:26,66 --> 0:1:28,26
But I understood later.

35
0:1:28,26 --> 0:1:31,12
Life is a journey where I tread as if on thin ice.

36
0:1:31,12 --> 0:1:32,6
Life is a journey.

37
0:1:32,6 --> 0:1:35,669
Actually, according to the standard theory,

38
0:1:35,669 --> 0:1:38,29
teenagers tend to be more impulsive,

39
0:1:38,29 --> 0:1:41,35
in your twenties, you have all sorts of desires,

40
0:1:41,35 --> 0:1:43,21
and all sorts of behaviors,

41
0:1:43,21 --> 0:1:45,41
by your thirties, you might start a company,

42
0:1:45,41 --> 0:1:46,43
right?

43
0:1:46,43 --> 0:1:48,3
and there’s real criminal investigation involved,

44
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:48,95
it involves detailed work,

45
0:1:48,95 --> 0:1:49,43
right?

46
0:1:49,43 --> 0:1:51,53
What do you have in terms of financial matters?

47
0:1:51,53 --> 0:1:52,75
Areas where you're confused

48
0:1:52,75 --> 0:1:53,57
Areas where you lack legal knowledge

49
0:1:53,57 --> 0:1:55,61
Places where you don't know can easily lead to mistakes

50
0:1:55,61 --> 0:1:58,43
So throughout one's life, it's essential to know the law

51
0:1:58,43 --> 0:2:0,37
First and foremost, you need to understand the law

52
0:2:0,37 --> 0:2:2,329
Understand the situation at hand

53
0:2:2,329 --> 0:2:3,729
And you must respect the law

54
0:2:3,729 --> 0:2:5,249
Respect the authority of the law

55
0:2:5,249 --> 0:2:6,49
For me,

56
0:2:6,49 --> 0:2:7,96
the authority of the law lies in what?

57
0:2:7,96 --> 0:2:11,46
It lies in seeking a lawyer first when there's an issue.

58
0:2:11,46 --> 0:2:12,84
Not going to the media.

59
0:2:12,84 --> 0:2:16,27
Many people nowadays are swayed by online trends,

60
0:2:16,27 --> 0:2:18,15
which can lead them astray.

61
0:2:18,15 --> 0:2:20,26
They think that as long as they make a big fuss about it,

62
0:2:20,26 --> 0:2:21,7
once everyone knows about it,

63
0:2:21,7 --> 0:2:22,58
the parties involved will feel embarrassed.

64
0:2:22,58 --> 0:2:24,579
He can bring up something that is actually useless, right?

65
0:2:24,579 --> 0:2:25,459
It's actually useless.

66
0:2:25,459 --> 0:2:28,59
You'll find that when things escalate, that's when people start talking.

67
0:2:28,59 --> 0:2:31,8
Ultimately, it's still about who has the right and who has the advantage.

68
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:32,4
Often, you know,

69
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:35,86
We need to respect the professionalism of the law right from the start.

70
0:2:35,86 --> 0:2:37,68
There are many types of lawyers, you know.

71
0:2:37,68 --> 0:2:38,6
There are divorce lawyers,

72
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:39,46
contract lawyers.

73
0:2:39,46 --> 0:2:40,209
Is that right?

74
0:2:40,209 --> 0:2:42,409
There are legal advisors from large corporations.

75
0:2:42,409 --> 0:2:44,4
There are all sorts of them.

76
0:2:44,4 --> 0:2:46,54
For example, there are copyright lawyers.

77
0:2:46,54 --> 0:2:47,56
There are civil ones.

78
0:2:47,56 --> 0:2:48,68
There are criminal ones.

79
0:2:48,68 --> 0:2:50,34
Criminal defense lawyers.

80
0:2:50,34 --> 0:2:51,24
They're all different.

81
0:2:51,24 --> 0:2:54,8
So each law, like copyright law,

82
0:2:54,8 --> 0:2:55,2
That's precisely the case.

83
0:2:55,2 --> 0:2:57,85
So, every law has its specialized content.

84
0:2:57,85 --> 0:3:0,71
When we look at their entire lives,

85
0:3:0,71 --> 0:3:2,25
starting from law school,

86
0:3:2,25 --> 0:3:4,9
graduating with a degree in law,

87
0:3:4,9 --> 0:3:5,7
passing the bar exam,

88
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:7,21
and then interning at a professional law firm,

89
0:3:7,21 --> 0:3:9,13
interacting with the courts for a long time,

90
0:3:9,13 --> 0:3:11,22
and dealing with the police as well.

91
0:3:11,22 --> 0:3:12,92
The experience accumulated by others

92
0:3:12,92 --> 0:3:15,42
is not just several times more than yours

93
0:3:15,42 --> 0:3:16,61
it's hundreds of times more

94
0:3:16,61 --> 0:3:19,71
and there's a statistical probability for that

95
0:3:19,71 --> 0:3:21,49
like when I sometimes do consulting

96
0:3:21,49 --> 0:3:23,33
Check out this one from my company.

97
0:3:23,33 --> 0:3:24,48
the scope of business

98
0:3:24,48 --> 0:3:25,68
corporate culture consulting

99
0:3:25,68 --> 0:3:28,81
personal financial management consulting, that's how it works

100
0:3:28,81 --> 0:3:30,75
The more clients you interact with,

101
0:3:30,75 --> 0:3:32,91
the more accurate advice you can give them.

102
0:3:32,91 --> 0:3:33,49
Why is that?

103
0:3:33,49 --> 0:3:34,94
Because most people,

104
0:3:34,94 --> 0:3:38,14
they accumulate their experiences of success and failure.

105
0:3:38,14 --> 0:3:39,38
Lawyers do the same.

106
0:3:39,38 --> 0:3:41,1
Being a lawyer is a highly professional career.

107
0:3:41,1 --> 0:3:43,42
Often,

108
0:3:43,42 --> 0:3:46,2
they base their advice on past clients.

109
0:3:46,2 --> 0:3:48,82
The actual handling situations are different.

110
0:3:48,82 --> 0:3:50,6
And I suggest that everyone,

111
0:3:50,6 --> 0:3:52,6
if you are in Shandong,

112
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:53,38
find a lawyer in Shandong,

113
0:3:53,38 --> 0:3:55,9
if you are in Henan, find a lawyer in Henan.

114
0:3:55,9 --> 0:3:58,52
Never cross regions,

115
0:3:58,52 --> 0:4:0,6
cross industries,

116
0:4:0,6 --> 0:4:2,33
or cross specialties to look for one,

117
0:4:2,33 --> 0:4:3,37
as it's not appropriate.

118
0:4:3,37 --> 0:4:4,69
If you find yourself in a new place,

119
0:4:4,69 --> 0:4:6,47
where you don't know anyone or anything,

120
0:4:6,47 --> 0:4:10,53
try not to be overly boastful or aggressive.

121
0:4:10,53 --> 0:4:11,41
Don't act like a bully.

122
0:4:11,41 --> 0:4:12,47
Avoid doing such things.

123
0:4:12,47 --> 0:4:13,69
You should tread carefully.

124
0:4:13,69 --> 0:4:14,85
When you're in a different place,

125
0:4:14,85 --> 0:4:18,21
make sure not to be overly showy or arrogant.

126
0:4:18,21 --> 0:4:20,53
If you're eating dumplings, dip them in soy sauce if that's what you should do.

127
0:4:20,53 --> 0:4:22,799
You should dip it in vinegar when it's appropriate, right?

128
0:4:22,799 --> 0:4:24,359
In many cases,

129
0:4:24,359 --> 0:4:25,919
don't do things that may cause suspicion.

130
0:4:25,919 --> 0:4:28,61
because you never know when certain things might come your way.

131
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:29,85
And when such things happen,

132
0:4:29,85 --> 0:4:31,13
The first thing is to stay calm

133
0:4:31,13 --> 0:4:32,39
Believe that,

134
0:4:32,39 --> 0:4:35,5
believe in the fairness of the law,

135
0:4:35,5 --> 0:4:37,9
and at the same time, understand that the law is fair.

136
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:40,45
So you need to find the most professional people to help you.

137
0:4:40,45 --> 0:4:42,15
So, no matter what,

138
0:4:42,15 --> 0:4:43,19
Like me, speaking here,

139
0:4:43,19 --> 0:4:45,69
I have many lawyers on my WeChat,

140
0:4:45,69 --> 0:4:48,81
I specifically label each lawyer’s location,

141
0:4:48,81 --> 0:4:50,89
For example, this lawyer is from Wuhan,

142
0:4:50,89 --> 0:4:52,11
This lawyer is from Nanjing,

143
0:4:52,11 --> 0:4:53,61
This lawyer specializes in contract law,

144
0:4:53,61 --> 0:4:55,38
This lawyer focuses on criminal defense.

145
0:4:55,38 --> 0:4:57,2
This lawyer specializes in divorce cases.

146
0:4:57,2 --> 0:4:58,98
This lawyer deals with legal matters related to going abroad.

147
0:4:58,98 --> 0:4:59,58
It's about foreign trade.

148
0:4:59,58 --> 0:5:0,98
I always give people special notes.

149
0:5:0,98 --> 0:5:3,66
I have a great deal of respect for the lawyer among my friends.

150
0:5:3,66 --> 0:5:5,69
And for all kinds of police officers.

151
0:5:5,69 --> 0:5:6,35
That's how it is.

152
0:5:6,35 --> 0:5:8,539
Because everyone has their own area of expertise.

153
0:5:8,539 --> 0:5:11,579
No matter when you encounter something, it's always like this.

154
0:5:11,579 --> 0:5:12,939
Ask others more often

155
0:5:12,939 --> 0:5:14,919
Consult a lawyer for some matters

156
0:5:14,919 --> 0:5:18,35
Uncle Hat can be consulted for certain things

157
0:5:18,35 --> 0:5:19,87
It's actually very safe

158
0:5:19,87 --> 0:5:20,93
In many cases

159
0:5:20,93 --> 0:5:23,53
If you don’t do anything that could be misinterpreted

160
0:5:23,53 --> 0:5:26,5
If you don’t do anything ambiguous

161
0:5:26,5 --> 0:5:27,81
Some things won’t find you

162
0:5:27,81 --> 0:5:29,13
Some things won’t come to you

163
0:5:29,13 --> 0:5:32,27
We can't really specify what's ambiguous.

164
0:5:32,27 --> 0:5:34,83
In any case, don't leave room for misinterpretation.

165
0:5:34,83 --> 0:5:36,37
Don't give the other party a chance.

166
0:5:36,37 --> 0:5:37,63
Just proceed with it.

167
0:5:37,63 --> 0:5:38,75
How should I put this?

168
0:5:38,75 --> 0:5:41,34
Tsk, leave a way for them to counterattack.

169
0:5:41,34 --> 0:5:42,62
Many people often say,

170
0:5:42,62 --> 0:5:44,19
I'm willing to go to bars and nightclubs.

171
0:5:44,19 --> 0:5:45,79
I'm willing to go to PC.

172
0:5:45,79 --> 0:5:47,9
I'm free

173
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:49,14
I don't care about being young

174
0:5:49,14 --> 0:5:50,78
Anyway, it's no big deal

175
0:5:50,78 --> 0:5:53,8
I belong to the vulnerable group of citizens

176
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:54,62
The law will protect me

177
0:5:54,62 --> 0:5:55,49
Don't think like that

178
0:5:55,49 --> 0:5:57,69
Because many people, once they commit a crime

179
0:5:57,69 --> 0:5:59,53
They are no longer ordinary people

180
0:5:59,53 --> 0:6:0,82
They become criminals

181
0:6:0,82 --> 0:6:3,38
There's not much to talk about when it comes to criminals.

182
0:6:3,38 --> 0:6:3,94
Not much at all.

183
0:6:3,94 --> 0:6:5,66
You're different from ordinary good people.

184
0:6:5,66 --> 0:6:6,289
Right?

185
0:6:6,289 --> 0:6:9,29
So, a lot of the time, it’s best to avoid places like bars.

186
0:6:9,29 --> 0:6:10,269
Nightclubs and such.

187
0:6:10,269 --> 0:6:13,77
Because in those places, you’re more likely to encounter things like prostitution, gambling, and drugs.

188
0:6:13,77 --> 0:6:15,95
The closer you get, the more likely you are to run into problems.

189
0:6:15,95 --> 0:6:17,95
Look, I’ve never dared to touch prostitution, gambling, or drugs in my entire life.

190
0:6:17,95 --> 0:6:18,31
Why?

191
0:6:18,31 --> 0:6:21,27
Because I know the harm isn't in the thing itself.

192
0:6:21,27 --> 0:6:23,559
It's not just about the money.

193
0:6:23,559 --> 0:6:25,579
It really goes beyond just money.

194
0:6:25,579 --> 0:6:28,549
Often, what gets you into trouble is this kind of issue.

195
0:6:28,549 --> 0:6:29,989
You have to be very careful.

196
0:6:29,989 --> 0:6:31,189
Always stay humble and cautious.

197
0:6:31,189 --> 0:6:31,989
Don't be arrogant or impatient.

198
0:6:31,989 --> 0:6:34,189
Throughout my life, I tread as if on thin ice.

199
0:6:34,189 --> 0:6:37,5
I've never dared to confront such matters head-on

200
0:6:37,5 --> 0:6:38,78
And most importantly

201
0:6:38,78 --> 0:6:41,74
Remember, the character for 'color' has a knife above it

202
0:6:41,74 --> 0:6:42,42
Many people say

203
0:6:42,42 --> 0:6:43,74
Going to bars to pick up people

204
0:6:43,74 --> 0:6:45,2
You're saying this kind of behavior

205
0:6:45,2 --> 0:6:46,3
It's just plain stupid

206
0:6:46,3 --> 0:6:46,66
Some say

207
0:6:46,66 --> 0:6:48,32
I don't have any issues with that

208
0:6:48,32 --> 0:6:50,86
Often, you think you're fine.

209
0:6:50,86 --> 0:6:54,0
But that's just the survivor's advantage.

210
0:6:54,0 --> 0:6:55,88
Often, you don't know about it.

211
0:6:55,88 --> 0:6:58,63
When something really goes wrong, you'll regret it.

212
0:6:58,63 --> 0:7:0,27
So you should be grateful for the past.

213
0:7:0,27 --> 0:7:1,37
Everyone gave you a break.

214
0:7:1,37 --> 0:7:3,5
In many cases, it's like this.

215
0:7:3,5 --> 0:7:5,1
And let me tell you,

216
0:7:5,1 --> 0:7:7,1
There are some things that, you know,

217
0:7:7,1 --> 0:7:8,9
We're not talking about everything.

218
0:7:9,98 --> 0:7:14,29
Many things can be resolved without escalating the situation.

219
0:7:14,29 --> 0:7:18,65
When you calmly and rationally discuss things with others.

220
0:7:18,65 --> 0:7:19,97
There's always room for negotiation.

221
0:7:19,97 --> 0:7:24,69
And often, the outcome of many issues comes down to money.

222
0:7:24,69 --> 0:7:25,87
It's about financial matters.

223
0:7:25,87 --> 0:7:27,58
It's about disputes over interests.

224
0:7:27,58 --> 0:7:29,92
Many people argue with you because of this.

225
0:7:29,92 --> 0:7:33,56
Including incidents like car accidents.

226
0:7:33,56 --> 0:7:36,2
Don't argue over this and that with each other

227
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:38,66
Everyone uses their own energy

228
0:7:38,66 --> 0:7:39,7
To do their own thing

229
0:7:39,7 --> 0:7:42,62
In the end, it all boils down to the amount of compensation

230
0:7:42,62 --> 0:7:43,42
So you have to believe

231
0:7:43,42 --> 0:7:46,2
There's nothing in this world that can't be resolved

232
0:7:46,2 --> 0:7:47,9
Even when you see a lot of people involved

233
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:49,49
It often comes down to the compensation amount

234
0:7:49,49 --> 0:7:51,3
So at any time

235
0:7:51,3 --> 0:7:53,3
Remember, first and foremost, don't suffer immediate losses.

236
0:7:53,3 --> 0:7:54,61
Second, don't confront head-on.

237
0:7:54,61 --> 0:7:57,39
Third, try to communicate effectively.

238
0:7:57,39 --> 0:7:59,279
Make sure to explain the rationale clearly.

239
0:7:59,279 --> 0:8:0,139
Don't.

240
0:8:0,139 --> 0:8:1,339
How should I put this?

241
0:8:1,339 --> 0:8:2,419
Acting rashly in the moment.

242
0:8:2,419 --> 0:8:3,84
Giving in to a moment's anger.

243
0:8:3,84 --> 0:8:6,32
The result of confronting someone head-on is that you end up losing.

244
0:8:6,32 --> 0:8:7,6
Because often times,

245
0:8:7,6 --> 0:8:8,68
we emphasize being modest and cautious,

246
0:8:8,68 --> 0:8:10,76
not being arrogant or impatient is a proper way to handle issues,

247
0:8:10,76 --> 0:8:12,25
a way to resolve conflicts.

248
0:8:12,25 --> 0:8:15,5
Many times, don't think of seeking out journalists just because you're idle,

249
0:8:15,5 --> 0:8:16,33
or posting on Weibo just because you have nothing to do,

250
0:8:16,33 --> 0:8:17,53
or sharing on your Moments just because you're bored,

251
0:8:17,53 --> 0:8:20,43
or publishing all your chat records and such.

252
0:8:20,43 --> 0:8:22,65
Actually, this is a sign of legal ignorance.

253
0:8:22,65 --> 0:8:23,91
This is the most fundamental issue.

254
0:8:23,91 --> 0:8:26,59
Today, I saw someone in the group chat saying,

255
0:8:26,59 --> 0:8:27,79
about that scumbag,

256
0:8:27,79 --> 0:8:29,67
what he did and all that.

257
0:8:29,67 --> 0:8:32,1
I said this is a classic case of legal ignorance.

258
0:8:32,1 --> 0:8:33,15
This scumbag,

259
0:8:33,15 --> 0:8:34,77
his home address,

260
0:8:34,77 --> 0:8:38,24
Everything I did was exposed by you, right?

261
0:8:38,24 --> 0:8:40,62
you've committed the crime of defamation.

262
0:8:40,62 --> 0:8:42,28
He said that what he did was wrong.

263
0:8:42,28 --> 0:8:43,72
The law doesn't care about that.

264
0:8:43,72 --> 0:8:46,17
That's what he means.

265
0:8:49,37 --> 0:8:51,71
If you leak this to the media,

266
0:8:51,71 --> 0:8:53,77
it counts as defamation.

267
0:8:53,77 --> 0:8:55,25
This is the truth.

268
0:8:59,45 --> 0:9:0,99
He's enjoying himself even while eating shit.

269
0:9:0,99 --> 0:9:3,73
Even if it's true,

270
0:9:3,73 --> 0:9:5,9
you're still committing defamation.

271
0:9:5,9 --> 0:9:6,41
Do you understand?

272
0:9:6,81 --> 0:9:8,81
If this isn't true,

273
0:9:10,11 --> 0:9:12,51
Defamation is a serious criminal offense.

274
0:9:12,51 --> 0:9:15,42
That's why many people think they can get away with anything online.

275
0:9:15,42 --> 0:9:18,56
You see, whoever spreads false rumors doesn't go unpunished, right?

276
0:9:18,56 --> 0:9:19,94
So, in many cases,

277
0:9:19,94 --> 0:9:21,18
the more famous someone is,

278
0:9:21,18 --> 0:9:22,92
the more attention they attract.

279
0:9:22,92 --> 0:9:23,96
having a bit of power

280
0:9:23,96 --> 0:9:24,76
being a minor official

281
0:9:24,76 --> 0:9:25,34
having some money

282
0:9:25,34 --> 0:9:27,0
people will start to covet you

283
0:9:27,0 --> 0:9:28,9
they'll try to bring you down

284
0:9:28,9 --> 0:9:31,4
just look at the false accusation case against Zhu Jun

285
0:9:31,4 --> 0:9:34,56
so remember the right approach

286
0:9:34,56 --> 0:9:36,25
first, you need to back down

287
0:9:36,25 --> 0:9:36,85
back down

288
0:9:36,85 --> 0:9:39,79
Don't always assume that everything is presumed innocent.

289
0:9:39,79 --> 0:9:40,91
It's not that easy.

290
0:9:40,91 --> 0:9:42,89
First and foremost, you need to trust the law.

291
0:9:42,89 --> 0:9:44,47
Trust the professionalism of your lawyer.

292
0:9:44,47 --> 0:9:46,15
Follow the lawyer's guidance and advice.

293
0:9:46,15 --> 0:9:48,83
There are various actions involved.

294
0:9:49,18 --> 0:9:51,5
Don't do anything the lawyer advises against.

295
0:9:51,5 --> 0:9:54,16
And most importantly, you need to understand.

296
0:9:54,16 --> 0:9:58,33
Many things, to put it bluntly, can't be spelled out too clearly.

297
0:9:58,33 --> 0:10:1,52
It's not good if you're too explicit.

298
0:10:1,52 --> 0:10:2,74
Don't act on impulse.

299
0:10:2,74 --> 0:10:4,98
Don't let someone who doesn't understand the situation

300
0:10:4,98 --> 0:10:6,52
your parents speak on your behalf,

301
0:10:6,52 --> 0:10:7,95
or do things for you.

302
0:10:7,95 --> 0:10:11,59
Don't give them ammunition by idly saying something.

303
0:10:11,59 --> 0:10:12,95
This is crucial.

304
0:10:12,95 --> 0:10:14,35
Maintaining contact is right,

305
0:10:14,35 --> 0:10:15,75
but let the lawyer handle the communication.

306
0:10:15,75 --> 0:10:16,93
Let the lawyer handle it.

307
0:10:16,93 --> 0:10:17,93
Anything can be worked out.

308
0:10:17,93 --> 0:10:19,25
There's always room for maneuver.

309
0:10:19,25 --> 0:10:20,57
Whether it's your attitude in admitting fault,

310
0:10:20,57 --> 0:10:22,73
or your willingness to compensate in various ways,

311
0:10:22,73 --> 0:10:24,69
in many cases,

312
0:10:24,69 --> 0:10:27,309
if you haven't repaid the money you owe,

313
0:10:27,309 --> 0:10:29,54
and you don't show a good attitude of repentance,

314
0:10:29,54 --> 0:10:31,66
then you might as well stand your ground.

315
0:10:31,66 --> 0:10:34,15
You need to trust in the fairness of the law.

316
0:10:34,15 --> 0:10:35,83
This has become known nationwide.

317
0:10:35,83 --> 0:10:38,11
Then you might really have no room for maneuver.

318
0:10:38,11 --> 0:10:40,73
Of course, the most important thing is not to break the law.

319
0:10:40,73 --> 0:10:43,52
Don't infringe on others' rights.

320
0:10:43,88 --> 0:10:46,88
You can think the other party is...

321
0:10:46,88 --> 0:10:47,6
No matter what.

322
0:10:47,6 --> 0:10:49,61
If someone bullies you.

323
0:10:49,61 --> 0:10:51,79
The other party has no reason.

324
0:10:51,79 --> 0:10:54,15
This mistake isn't yours to bear.

325
0:10:54,15 --> 0:10:56,5
But in many situations,

326
0:10:56,5 --> 0:10:58,64
in practical operations,

327
0:10:58,64 --> 0:11:0,4
you've already taken a clear hit,

328
0:11:0,4 --> 0:11:1,68
so don't insist on fighting it out.

329
0:11:1,68 --> 0:11:3,3
It's pointless.

330
0:11:3,3 --> 0:11:5,779
Because in many cases, it's not a place where you can just reason things out.

331
0:11:5,779 --> 0:11:8,739
I mean, it's not a place where you can argue your case freely.

332
0:11:8,739 --> 0:11:11,139
Often, things have to be handled according to the law.

333
0:11:11,139 --> 0:11:12,499
Based on the facts at the time

334
0:11:12,499 --> 0:11:14,38
Following the procedures of the investigation

335
0:11:14,38 --> 0:11:16,78
Isn't it that everyone would feel wronged if they said that

336
0:11:17,7 --> 0:11:18,66
Wouldn't that just be chaos

337
0:11:18,66 --> 0:11:20,1
So in many cases

338
0:11:20,1 --> 0:11:21,91
It's not about what you think

339
0:11:21,91 --> 0:11:24,55
It's not about your subjective perception of the facts

340
0:11:24,55 --> 0:11:27,36
But it's about the objective view from a third party

341
0:11:27,36 --> 0:11:30,36
Whether you are the perpetrator or the victim

342
0:11:30,36 --> 0:11:33,3
It's about how a third party perceives the situation

343
0:11:33,3 --> 0:11:35,95
And it also depends on the social context of the time

344
0:11:35,95 --> 0:11:37,53
This is crucial

345
0:11:37,53 --> 0:11:39,47
What was the prevailing social climate back then

346
0:11:39,47 --> 0:11:41,31
What was the social situation at that time

347
0:11:41,31 --> 0:11:42,31
It's very important

348
0:11:42,31 --> 0:11:45,49
The development of China's legal system has been a long process

349
0:11:45,49 --> 0:11:47,39
You need to understand that going back a few decades

350
0:11:47,39 --> 0:11:49,67
There were many crimes that don't exist now

351
0:11:49,67 --> 0:11:50,7
Right?

352
0:11:50,7 --> 0:11:51,55
So now you have to look at it from that time's perspective

353
0:11:51,55 --> 0:11:54,18
To understand the issues of that era

354
0:11:54,18 --> 0:11:55,4
And the issues of today

355
0:11:55,4 --> 0:11:56,52
Everyone would deserve to be shot

356
0:11:56,52 --> 0:11:57,1
Right?

357
0:11:57,1 --> 0:11:58,39
Many things are like this

358
0:11:58,39 --> 0:12:1,61
We need to have wisdom when it comes to many things

359
0:12:1,61 --> 0:12:3,63
Don't argue with history

360
0:12:3,63 --> 0:12:5,46
Don't argue with reality

361
0:12:5,46 --> 0:12:6,9
You can't win a fight against a stronger force

362
0:12:6,9 --> 0:12:8,82
There are many places where we can speak openly

363
0:12:8,82 --> 0:12:9,98
We can find someone to help

364
0:12:9,98 --> 0:12:10,62
Find someone

365
0:12:10,62 --> 0:12:11,46
We can leverage connections

366
0:12:11,46 --> 0:12:12,12
Leverage connections

367
0:12:12,12 --> 0:12:14,62
Many situations aren't as inflexible as they seem

368
0:12:14,62 --> 0:12:16,56
In China, many issues

369
0:12:16,56 --> 0:12:19,48
Everyone believes that offering a cigarette

370
0:12:19,48 --> 0:12:21,44
or raising a toast can solve it

371
0:12:21,44 --> 0:12:23,44
So what I'm talking about is

372
0:12:23,44 --> 0:12:26,2
the difference between a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old

373
0:12:26,2 --> 0:12:27,84
At 20, you're full of vigor and enthusiasm

374
0:12:27,84 --> 0:12:29,98
thinking you can take on the world with your bare hands

375
0:12:29,98 --> 0:12:33,2
but in reality, it's still your parents who clean up your mess

376
0:12:33,2 --> 0:12:35,3
So by the time you reach 40, you realize

377
0:12:35,3 --> 0:12:36,62
that everyone is equal before the law

378
0:12:36,62 --> 0:12:38,469
We need to learn the law

379
0:12:38,469 --> 0:12:39,209
We need to spread legal knowledge

380
0:12:39,209 --> 0:12:40,629
Mastering the right methods is crucial

381
0:12:40,629 --> 0:12:43,509
I'm still learning about new developments to this day

382
0:12:43,509 --> 0:12:44,78
We need to keep learning

383
0:12:44,78 --> 0:12:46,26
Follow these cases and such

384
0:12:46,26 --> 0:12:49,85
Many people tend to get caught up in their own emotions

385
0:12:49,85 --> 0:12:51,89
Thinking they are someone else

386
0:12:51,89 --> 0:12:53,98
Thinking they are that person

387
0:12:53,98 --> 0:12:54,9
The woman puts herself in the woman's shoes

388
0:12:54,9 --> 0:12:55,78
The man puts himself in the man's shoes

389
0:12:55,78 --> 0:12:57,54
So they both speak from their own perspectives

390
0:12:57,54 --> 0:12:58,9
Both believe they are the victims

391
0:12:58,9 --> 0:13:0,4
Both see themselves as the injured party

392
0:13:0,4 --> 0:13:1,4
Each expresses their own views

393
0:13:1,4 --> 0:13:2,2
And then

394
0:13:2,2 --> 0:13:4,8
Regardless of how society ultimately turns out

395
0:13:4,8 --> 0:13:6,24
You feel that there are all kinds of provocations causing conflict and division

396
0:13:6,24 --> 0:13:7,44
Actually, this is not a good approach.

397
0:13:7,44 --> 0:13:9,66
It can easily create a chaotic and negative social environment.

398
0:13:9,66 --> 0:13:12,92
Self-media platforms should also have a sense of responsibility.

399
0:13:12,92 --> 0:13:14,22
They need to keep learning.

400
0:13:14,22 --> 0:13:16,3
They need to know when it’s appropriate to speak up.

401
0:13:16,3 --> 0:13:17,359
And when it’s better to stay silent.

402
0:13:17,359 --> 0:13:19,479
So I can offer a reminder here for everyone.

403
0:13:19,479 --> 0:13:22,479
Remember to avoid walking by the river whenever possible.

404
0:13:22,479 --> 0:13:23,69
Frequent walks by the river are risky.

405
0:13:23,69 --> 0:13:24,65
Who says you have to get your feet wet?

406
0:13:24,65 --> 0:13:25,69
Then you don’t go.

407
0:13:25,69 --> 0:13:26,69
Look at the internet cafe.

408
0:13:26,69 --> 0:13:29,83
Places like nightclubs and bars, why not go to a pool hall?

409
0:13:29,83 --> 0:13:31,39
Why not play on a PC?

410
0:13:31,39 --> 0:13:32,39
Why not stay away from adult content?

411
0:13:32,39 --> 0:13:33,83
Why bother with these things?

412
0:13:33,83 --> 0:13:34,93
Why touch those slot machines?

413
0:13:34,93 --> 0:13:36,37
Where would there be so many troubles?

414
0:13:36,37 --> 0:13:37,15
Is that right?

415
0:13:37,15 --> 0:13:38,63
So in many cases,

416
0:13:38,63 --> 0:13:40,67
especially a lot of people don't know this,

417
0:13:40,67 --> 0:13:42,77
those so-called Nine Great Deity Welfare Machines,

418
0:13:42,77 --> 0:13:45,33
the bosses who illegally collect public deposits,

419
0:13:45,33 --> 0:13:46,65
many of them have already been caught,

420
0:13:46,65 --> 0:13:48,86
so a lot of people are unaware of these things,

421
0:13:48,86 --> 0:13:51,2
you really need to be cautious,

422
0:13:51,2 --> 0:13:54,22
even someone as cautious as me, who is always on guard

423
0:13:54,22 --> 0:13:57,34
Sometimes, you might also encounter some

424
0:13:57,34 --> 0:13:58,58
very challenging situations

425
0:13:58,58 --> 0:14:0,9
In such cases, when it's necessary, you should consult a lawyer

426
0:14:0,9 --> 0:14:2,1
consult a lawyer

427
0:14:2,1 --> 0:14:3,46
you should seek advice from

428
0:14:3,46 --> 0:14:5,8
If you trust Uncle Hat, then trust Uncle Hat

429
0:14:5,8 --> 0:14:6,78
Often, in many situations

430
0:14:6,78 --> 0:14:8,14
you need to have friends

431
0:14:8,14 --> 0:14:9,63
you don't have any friends

432
0:14:9,63 --> 0:14:11,33
There's a person who's away from home

433
0:14:11,33 --> 0:14:13,9
What else are you going to do

434
0:14:13,9 --> 0:14:14,71
Some dirty deeds

435
0:14:14,71 --> 0:14:17,19
So you've been wronged in this matter

436
0:14:17,19 --> 0:14:17,95
Falsely accused

437
0:14:17,95 --> 0:14:18,59
Set up by someone

438
0:14:18,59 --> 0:14:20,47
That's quite normal, right

439
0:14:20,47 --> 0:14:23,52
So when you're not in your own backyard

440
0:14:23,52 --> 0:14:24,64
You need to mind your own business

441
0:14:24,64 --> 0:14:25,9
You always have to remember

442
0:14:25,9 --> 0:14:27,48
you are just an ordinary person

443
0:14:27,48 --> 0:14:30,68
just an ordinary individual in a big city

444
0:14:30,68 --> 0:14:31,84
couldn't be more common

445
0:14:31,84 --> 0:14:34,8
you're not from an ancient noble family

446
0:14:34,8 --> 0:14:35,32
In my hometown, the Brahman community

447
0:14:35,32 --> 0:14:37,72
If you really are from the Brahman caste and plan to leave your county

448
0:14:37,72 --> 0:14:39,28
there might be something wrong with me too

449
0:14:39,28 --> 0:14:41,0
it's the same in any society

450
0:14:41,0 --> 0:14:44,15
A few days ago, a blogger was filming in Sweden

451
0:14:44,15 --> 0:14:44,95
and then got arrested

452
0:14:44,95 --> 0:14:45,87
That's how it is

453
0:14:45,87 --> 0:14:48,59
Sweden is one of the most anti-China countries in the world

454
0:14:48,59 --> 0:14:50,59
When US police encounter some issues

455
0:14:50,59 --> 0:14:51,79
In our place

456
0:14:51,79 --> 0:14:53,73
people can throw tantrums and act unruly

457
0:14:53,73 --> 0:14:56,59
there's room for de-escalation

458
0:14:56,59 --> 0:14:57,81
but over there, they might just shoot

459
0:14:57,81 --> 0:14:59,13
So, often it's not about which society you're in,

460
0:14:59,13 --> 0:15:0,73
it's the same in any society,

461
0:15:0,73 --> 0:15:2,13
the United States is also a society where personal connections matter,

462
0:15:2,13 --> 0:15:3,97
Japan is no different,

463
0:15:3,97 --> 0:15:4,97
so to speak,

464
0:15:4,97 --> 0:15:5,89
if you have a relative over there,

465
0:15:5,89 --> 0:15:7,63
would you be able to get an advantage in Kyoto?

466
0:15:7,63 --> 0:15:9,61
would you be able to get an advantage in Texas?

467
0:15:9,61 --> 0:15:11,74
Do you think you can get the upper hand over Texas?

468
0:15:11,74 --> 0:15:13,42
If you have two lively friends

469
0:15:13,42 --> 0:15:14,48
then it really makes a difference

470
0:15:14,48 --> 0:15:15,98
The environment is quite different

471
0:15:15,98 --> 0:15:18,93
So never compete with the environment

472
0:15:19,41 --> 0:15:20,49
While we're alive

473
0:15:20,49 --> 0:15:22,59
don't think these things have nothing to do with you

474
0:15:22,59 --> 0:15:25,5
Always keep the warning bell ringing in your mind

475
0:15:25,5 --> 0:15:26,53
Stay vigilant

476
0:15:26,53 --> 0:15:28,89
Because losing your freedom will cost you a lot

477
0:15:28,89 --> 0:15:29,71
Losing freedom

478
0:15:29,71 --> 0:15:30,79
You'll have a criminal record

479
0:15:30,79 --> 0:15:33,21
And you'll also have to pay civil damages

480
0:15:33,21 --> 0:15:33,61
Right?

481
0:15:33,61 --> 0:15:34,81
You'll bear criminal responsibility

482
0:15:34,81 --> 0:15:35,89
And also have to pay civil damages

483
0:15:35,89 --> 0:15:36,65
In many cases

484
0:15:36,65 --> 0:15:38,75
So I'm telling you, don't fight

485
0:15:38,75 --> 0:15:39,97
Don't fight

486
0:15:39,97 --> 0:15:42,34
Don't make any economic mistakes

487
0:15:42,34 --> 0:15:44,66
And avoid getting involved with gambling, prostitution, or drugs

488
0:15:44,66 --> 0:15:46,82
Many things are ambiguous

489
0:15:46,82 --> 0:15:48,95
If you can avoid doing something, then don't do it

490
0:15:48,95 --> 0:15:50,59
When you can avoid making mistakes

491
0:15:50,59 --> 0:15:51,87
Try not to make them

492
0:15:51,87 --> 0:15:55,4
Don't leave any room for ambiguity with anyone.

493
0:15:55,4 --> 0:15:57,48
Think thrice before you act

494
0:15:57,48 --> 0:15:58,48
Some things, you know

495
0:16:1,37 --> 0:16:4,31
think about how difficult it will be to prove your innocence later

496
0:16:4,31 --> 0:16:6,6
so don't engage in such activities in the first place

497
0:16:6,6 --> 0:16:7,84
So, when it comes to many things

498
0:16:7,84 --> 0:16:10,2
it's not about being evasive; rather

499
0:16:10,2 --> 0:16:11,32
you need to understand the law

500
0:16:11,32 --> 0:16:13,569
so that no one can use the law against you

501
0:16:13,569 --> 0:16:16,29
Secondly, it's about respecting the professionalism of the law

502
0:16:16,29 --> 0:16:17,129
if you need a lawyer, get one

503
0:16:17,129 --> 0:16:18,169
Thirdly,

504
0:16:18,169 --> 0:16:20,28
it’s important to make as many friends as possible,

505
0:16:20,28 --> 0:16:21,8
try to make more friends,

506
0:16:21,8 --> 0:16:22,24
right?

507
0:16:22,24 --> 0:16:23,76
having friends in every division,

508
0:16:23,76 --> 0:16:24,8
that’s a good thing,

509
0:16:24,8 --> 0:16:25,24
right?

510
0:16:25,24 --> 0:16:27,43
they can at least speak up for you,

511
0:16:27,43 --> 0:16:28,29
far and wide.

512
0:16:28,29 --> 0:16:29,71
So, in many cases,

513
0:16:29,71 --> 0:16:31,35
the most important thing is not to break the law.

514
0:16:31,35 --> 0:16:32,15
If you do commit a crime,

515
0:16:32,15 --> 0:16:34,3
others can't always speak up for you, right?

516
0:16:34,3 --> 0:16:35,7
For minor issues,

517
0:16:35,7 --> 0:16:36,82
like getting a ticket,

518
0:16:36,82 --> 0:16:38,14
it might be forgivable,

519
0:16:38,14 --> 0:16:39,7
or it could be a special circumstance,

520
0:16:39,7 --> 0:16:40,98
for example, if you're pregnant and didn't wear a seatbelt

521
0:16:40,98 --> 0:16:42,2
Then it can be forgiven.

522
0:16:42,2 --> 0:16:44,0
So that's how it often goes.

523
0:16:44,0 --> 0:16:46,96
There isn't much more wisdom I can offer.

524
0:16:46,96 --> 0:16:48,36
Tomorrow is my book signing event.

525
0:16:48,36 --> 0:16:51,69
I'll be arriving at the Shandong Book City on time tomorrow.

526
0:16:51,69 --> 0:16:53,5
This person throughout their life,

527
0:16:53,5 --> 0:16:54,93
Let me tell you, in many cases,

528
0:16:54,93 --> 0:16:56,3
Even if you don't make mistakes,

529
0:16:56,3 --> 0:16:57,36
Trouble will still find you.

530
0:16:57,36 --> 0:16:59,78
So often, when faced with issues, don't be afraid.

531
0:16:59,78 --> 0:17:2,27
It's important to respect the authority of the law.

532
0:17:2,27 --> 0:17:4,3
Respecting the authority of the law is crucial.

533
0:17:4,3 --> 0:17:5,59
We must also respect the professionalism of the law.

534
0:17:5,59 --> 0:17:8,99
The key is to avoid making mistakes unnecessarily.

535
0:17:8,99 --> 0:17:9,459
Even if you do make a mistake,

536
0:17:9,459 --> 0:17:10,519
it’s important to repent promptly.

537
0:17:10,519 --> 0:17:12,779
Communicate appropriately with others.

538
0:17:12,779 --> 0:17:15,66
Having a good attitude towards admitting guilt is essential.

539
0:17:15,66 --> 0:17:18,68
Problems that can be solved with money aren't really big problems.

540
0:17:18,68 --> 0:17:21,14
So, don't push people to their limits.

541
0:17:21,14 --> 0:17:22,699
Don't make absolute statements.

542
0:17:22,699 --> 0:17:24,139
Don't act on impulse.

543
0:17:24,139 --> 0:17:25,139
Often, that's how things are.

544
0:17:25,139 --> 0:17:27,579
Don't do things that please your enemies and upset your friends.

545
0:17:27,579 --> 0:17:29,95
Many things don't have clear rights and wrongs.

546
0:17:29,95 --> 0:17:32,29
Just because you escalate an issue doesn't mean it will be resolved.

547
0:17:32,29 --> 0:17:34,63
Try to resolve issues within a small circle.

548
0:17:34,63 --> 0:17:36,79
So, I'll say this to everyone again.

549
0:17:36,79 --> 0:17:37,83
No matter what,

550
0:17:37,83 --> 0:17:39,67
remember, in this society,

551
0:17:39,67 --> 0:17:41,15
you may not intend to harm others,

552
0:17:41,15 --> 0:17:44,16
but you can't guarantee that there aren't psychopaths in the world,

553
0:17:44,16 --> 0:17:46,36
or small-minded people,

554
0:17:46,36 --> 0:17:47,52
or those who want to bully you,

555
0:17:47,52 --> 0:17:48,48
or harm you.

556
0:17:48,48 --> 0:17:51,44
Many people in this world feel uncomfortable if you don't escalate things,

557
0:17:51,44 --> 0:17:52,36
they think it's a good thing,

558
0:17:52,36 --> 0:17:53,28
it's just crazy.

559
0:17:53,28 --> 0:17:54,46
So, don't provoke these people.

560
0:17:54,46 --> 0:17:57,56
If you do provoke them,

561
0:17:57,56 --> 0:17:59,2
remember at the first moment,

562
0:17:59,2 --> 0:18:0,56
Remember to tune in to TIME No.1 as well.

563
0:18:0,56 --> 0:18:2,8
the first thing is to calm them down.

564
0:18:2,8 --> 0:18:4,77
I think I have the right to speak on this.

565
0:18:4,77 --> 0:18:7,29
So, often remember this point,

566
0:18:7,29 --> 0:18:9,25
don't do anything too outrageous.

567
0:18:9,25 --> 0:18:10,93
If you do something outrageous,

568
0:18:10,93 --> 0:18:14,5
you should know how to handle it timely,

569
0:18:14,5 --> 0:18:15,53
how to handle it,

570
0:18:15,53 --> 0:18:18,33
don't do anything illegal or risky,

571
0:18:18,33 --> 0:18:19,57
risky things,

572
0:18:19,57 --> 0:18:21,47
some people often take pictures or videos and sell them online,

573
0:18:21,47 --> 0:18:23,85
sell them on Twitter,

574
0:18:23,85 --> 0:18:24,61
thinking it's fine because it's not seen in China,

575
0:18:24,61 --> 0:18:27,28
do you think the police are fools?

576
0:18:27,28 --> 0:18:28,16
Right?

577
0:18:28,16 --> 0:18:29,0
Some people even say, 'I've just made a few more friends, it's not a gathering or anything like that.',

578
0:18:29,0 --> 0:18:30,24
Is that true?

579
0:18:30,24 --> 0:18:31,32
Brother,

580
0:18:31,32 --> 0:18:33,1
do you understand that the law doesn't consider your specific circumstances?

581
0:18:33,1 --> 0:18:33,76
So, often speaking,

582
0:18:33,76 --> 0:18:36,52
we must enforce the law,

583
0:18:36,52 --> 0:18:38,14
pay attention to these matters,

584
0:18:38,14 --> 0:18:38,92
but we can't mislead public opinion in the wrong direction.

585
0:18:38,92 --> 0:18:39,44
This is very important.

586
0:18:39,44 --> 0:18:41,28
As a media creator,

587
0:18:41,28 --> 0:18:42,8
don't just chase traffic,

588
0:18:42,8 --> 0:18:44,42
you'll regret it.

589
0:18:44,42 --> 0:18:45,98
Often, that's how it goes.

590
0:18:45,98 --> 0:18:47,4
Pay attention to these matters

591
0:18:47,4 --> 0:18:50,54
no matter what happens,

592
0:18:50,54 --> 0:18:51,34
we always say,

593
0:18:51,34 --> 0:18:52,97
don't break the law,

594
0:18:52,97 --> 0:18:54,67
know and abide by the law,

595
0:18:56,57 --> 0:18:57,75
this is very important.

596
0:18:57,75 --> 0:18:58,88
And I hope everyone,

597
0:18:58,88 --> 0:19:0,0
lives happily every day,

598
0:19:0,0 --> 0:19:1,24
know and abide by the law,

599
0:19:1,24 --> 0:19:2,14
you won't have to fear these things.
