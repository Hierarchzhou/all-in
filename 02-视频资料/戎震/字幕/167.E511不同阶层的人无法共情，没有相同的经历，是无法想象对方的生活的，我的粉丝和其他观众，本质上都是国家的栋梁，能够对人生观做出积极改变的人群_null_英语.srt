0:0:0,64 --> 0:0:1,6
Hello everyone.

2
0:0:1,6 --> 0:0:6,36
People from different backgrounds can't fully empathize with each other.

3
0:0:6,36 --> 0:0:9,82
When we talk about everyone's creation,

4
0:0:9,82 --> 0:0:14,12
an author's work is always based on their class sentiment,

5
0:0:14,12 --> 0:0:17,28
and their personal life experiences.

6
0:0:17,56 --> 0:0:20,84
That's why I often say, someone like Lü Bu,

7
0:0:20,84 --> 0:0:22,78
why is he known as the Righteous Marquis?

8
0:0:22,78 --> 0:0:25,7
It's because he never betrayed the Han Dynasty.

9
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:27,38
The so-called killing of Ding Yuan,

10
0:0:27,38 --> 0:0:28,8
and the killing of Dong Zhuo,

11
0:0:28,8 --> 0:0:31,12
It was all the emperor's doing.

12
0:0:31,12 --> 0:0:32,0
So, to speak.

13
0:0:32,0 --> 0:0:33,52
The historical Lu Bu,

14
0:0:33,52 --> 0:0:37,13
in fact, was never referred to as a traitor to three lords.

15
0:0:37,13 --> 0:0:40,5
As for who the villains are in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms,

16
0:0:40,5 --> 0:0:41,21
it's actually quite simple.

17
0:0:41,21 --> 0:0:44,46
The Yellow Turban Rebellion was just.

18
0:0:44,46 --> 0:0:46,52
All the others were villains.

19
0:0:46,52 --> 0:0:49,67
Why did Luo Guanzhong hold Liu Bei in such high regard?

20
0:0:49,67 --> 0:0:53,51
Because Luo Guanzhong also participated in the peasant uprisings at the end of the Yuan dynasty.

21
0:0:53,51 --> 0:0:54,75
So he should respect Liu Bei

22
0:0:54,75 --> 0:0:58,24
In fact, he compares himself to Zhuge Liang

23
0:0:58,24 --> 0:1:3,1
So the rest of the people, like Cao Cao

24
0:1:3,1 --> 0:1:3,92
And Sun Quan

25
0:1:3,92 --> 0:1:5,72
And all sorts of other people

26
0:1:5,72 --> 0:1:10,44
Chen Shou's History of the Three Kingdoms follows the orthodox narrative of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties, which regards Cao Cao as the legitimate ruler.

27
0:1:10,44 --> 0:1:12,96
So he couldn’t possibly speak ill of Cao Cao

28
0:1:12,96 --> 0:1:13,92
Therefore, when it comes to it

29
0:1:13,92 --> 0:1:17,16
These authors tend to criticize Lu Bu

30
0:1:17,16 --> 0:1:19,12
But actually, Lu Bu was a good person

31
0:1:19,12 --> 0:1:22,63
History, they say, is like a young girl who can be dressed up by anyone.

32
0:1:22,63 --> 0:1:24,27
Speaking of which,

33
0:1:24,27 --> 0:1:25,21
we can't help but think about

34
0:1:25,21 --> 0:1:27,41
why so many Chinese films and TV shows

35
0:1:27,41 --> 0:1:29,75
we're not talking about a sequel to Nezha here,

36
0:1:29,75 --> 0:1:32,63
because these are entirely different concepts.

37
0:1:32,63 --> 0:1:34,37
why even the films and TV shows are hard to watch,

38
0:1:34,37 --> 0:1:34,99
it's really frustrating,

39
0:1:34,99 --> 0:1:38,39
it's because these are the things that people deal with in their daily lives,

40
0:1:38,39 --> 0:1:40,75
they are the children of mistresses.

41
0:1:40,75 --> 0:1:44,11
So in TV shows, it's all about mistresses getting the upper hand

42
0:1:44,11 --> 0:1:45,83
or the legal wife fighting with the mistress

43
0:1:45,83 --> 0:1:46,58
stuff like that

44
0:1:46,58 --> 0:1:49,0
because even in those campus romance dramas, it's the same

45
0:1:49,0 --> 0:1:49,82
mostly about

46
0:1:49,82 --> 0:1:51,97
one moment, some delinquent hanging out at a club

47
0:1:51,97 --> 0:1:54,17
the next, some rich kid

48
0:1:54,17 --> 0:1:54,65
and then

49
0:1:54,65 --> 0:1:56,1
bickering and jealousy over them

50
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,93
and then, the campus romance isn't all that great either

51
0:1:57,93 --> 0:1:59,57
You just feel it's so strange.

52
0:1:59,57 --> 0:2:1,25
Was it like this when we were in high school?

53
0:2:1,25 --> 0:2:3,63
No, these people never went to high school.

54
0:2:3,63 --> 0:2:7,1
So when these people think about the schools they attended,

55
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:8,6
it was just like this.

56
0:2:8,6 --> 0:2:9,84
They were always fighting and falling in love.

57
0:2:9,84 --> 0:2:12,22
No one cared about the college entrance exam.

58
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:14,2
Because these people scored 100 on the college entrance exam,

59
0:2:14,2 --> 0:2:14,46
200 points,

60
0:2:14,46 --> 0:2:15,76
or 300 points to get into college.

61
0:2:15,76 --> 0:2:19,66
So, it's hard for people from different backgrounds to empathize with each other.

62
0:2:19,66 --> 0:2:22,48
Yeah, I've got a sense of what's been going on these past couple of days.

63
0:2:22,48 --> 0:2:24,78
I have a particular fondness for the 'commoner princess' genre.

64
0:2:24,78 --> 0:2:27,56
But many of my female followers are commoner princesses

65
0:2:27,56 --> 0:2:29,78
It's my female followers

66
0:2:29,78 --> 0:2:33,54
often have to deal with some creepy guys who say things like

67
0:2:33,54 --> 0:2:34,92
I can get you a job

68
0:2:34,92 --> 0:2:35,96
I can take care of you

69
0:2:35,96 --> 0:2:37,19
What do you think about that

70
0:2:37,19 --> 0:2:40,79
They often make all sorts of job offers as an excuse to promise the girls things.

71
0:2:40,79 --> 0:2:43,1
I just think it’s really fun.

72
0:2:43,1 --> 0:2:47,3
Basically, men love to do two things,

73
0:2:47,3 --> 0:2:48,58
one is to persuade decent women to enter the sex industry,

74
0:2:48,58 --> 0:2:50,22
and the other is to persuade people to reform.

75
0:2:50,22 --> 0:2:52,12
They earn money with their own abilities,

76
0:2:52,12 --> 0:2:55,26
what’s wrong with that?

77
0:2:55,26 --> 0:2:58,55
And do you think women in this line of work

78
0:2:58,55 --> 0:3:1,53
would be swayed by your sweet talk?

79
0:3:1,53 --> 0:3:5,829
They hear nonsense from people like you every day,

80
0:3:5,829 --> 0:3:7,529
making all sorts of empty promises.

81
0:3:7,529 --> 0:3:9,549
But you're talking to them like that

82
0:3:9,549 --> 0:3:11,23
I'll take you to prepare for the postgraduate exam

83
0:3:11,23 --> 0:3:13,19
I'll get you a stable job

84
0:3:13,19 --> 0:3:15,1
Don't mess around with this and that

85
0:3:15,1 --> 0:3:17,36
In reality, this is all a form of condescension

86
0:3:17,36 --> 0:3:18,46
He just wants to freeload

87
0:3:18,46 --> 0:3:20,48
He just wants to play with you for free

88
0:3:20,48 --> 0:3:23,3
So once the novelty wears off

89
0:3:23,3 --> 0:3:24,75
What else will he come up with

90
0:3:24,75 --> 0:3:25,55
Another plan will emerge

91
0:3:25,55 --> 0:3:29,9
So this person is always packaging their true intentions.

92
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:32,87
People can never fully empathize with each other.

93
0:3:32,87 --> 0:3:35,95
That's why anyone with a different background can't...

94
0:3:35,95 --> 0:3:38,47
can't completely relate to you.

95
0:3:38,47 --> 0:3:40,55
Because they can only imagine.

96
0:3:40,55 --> 0:3:43,549
By projecting their own thoughts...

97
0:3:43,549 --> 0:3:45,469
to imagine what your life is like.

98
0:3:45,469 --> 0:3:47,709
So it's really hard for people to empathize with each other.

99
0:3:47,709 --> 0:3:50,76
Speaking of all the different backgrounds in China...

100
0:3:50,76 --> 0:3:53,24
I think among all these backgrounds...

101
0:3:53,24 --> 0:3:57,12
The ones who have it the hardest are the left-behind children and those from small towns who work odd jobs.

102
0:3:57,12 --> 0:4:0,839
Some are even left-behind children plus small-town Dijia fans.

103
0:4:0,839 --> 0:4:4,879
It's these people who have driven China's urbanization process.

104
0:4:4,879 --> 0:4:6,659
They have also propelled China's economy.

105
0:4:6,659 --> 0:4:9,359
These people have had it incredibly tough.

106
0:4:9,359 --> 0:4:12,32
Let's talk about the food delivery riders you see every day.

107
0:4:12,32 --> 0:4:15,66
They might have been left-behind children 10 or 20 years ago.

108
0:4:15,66 --> 0:4:17,38
Left-behind children form a distinct social class.

109
0:4:17,38 --> 0:4:20,14
A very tragic product of an era.

110
0:4:20,14 --> 0:4:21,159
To be honest

111
0:4:21,159 --> 0:4:23,46
Parents moved to the city for work

112
0:4:23,46 --> 0:4:24,5
There was no other choice

113
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:25,9
The children stayed with their grandparents

114
0:4:25,9 --> 0:4:27,44
They learned to manage the household from a young age

115
0:4:27,44 --> 0:4:29,4
Managing a poor household

116
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:31,51
It means taking care of the housework

117
0:4:31,51 --> 0:4:33,61
Not being the master of the world

118
0:4:33,61 --> 0:4:36,31
And many people are also known as diligent students

119
0:4:36,31 --> 0:4:39,53
They came from a very remote mountain village to the city

120
0:4:39,53 --> 0:4:41,65
He became lost when he arrived in this new place

121
0:4:41,65 --> 0:4:42,99
It was not an easy start.

122
0:4:42,99 --> 0:4:46,47
Because the foundation of all material wealth had to be earned through hard work.

123
0:4:46,47 --> 0:4:47,81
It all depended on myself.

124
0:4:47,81 --> 0:4:49,7
It was extremely challenging.

125
0:4:49,7 --> 0:4:52,26
So I've been consistently recommending to everyone in this video

126
0:4:52,26 --> 0:4:54,52
If you come from a very humble background,

127
0:4:54,52 --> 0:4:55,88
You might consider going abroad.

128
0:4:55,88 --> 0:4:57,54
That could be a good path.

129
0:4:57,54 --> 0:5:0,339
But if you are fortunate and strong, like a high-ranking official,

130
0:5:0,339 --> 0:5:1,619
And if you are from a weak family, you should seek opportunities elsewhere.

131
0:5:1,619 --> 0:5:3,519
If you really don't have much material wealth,

132
0:5:3,519 --> 0:5:4,999
I suggest you start a business early.

133
0:5:4,999 --> 0:5:7,44
Because some paths are not meant for you to climb.

134
0:5:7,44 --> 0:5:8,78
You won't be able to climb them.

135
0:5:8,78 --> 0:5:11,56
I especially don't recommend not finding locals,

136
0:5:11,56 --> 0:5:14,55
When you go to a city, it's best to find locals.

137
0:5:14,55 --> 0:5:15,79
Preferably city dwellers,

138
0:5:15,79 --> 0:5:17,69
Locals are the best choice.

139
0:5:17,69 --> 0:5:19,3
In that case,

140
0:5:19,3 --> 0:5:20,47
it won't be a double no.

141
0:5:20,47 --> 0:5:23,71
Families without a local hukou in the city

142
0:5:23,71 --> 0:5:25,67
face the greatest economic burden

143
0:5:25,67 --> 0:5:26,85
which is the most painful

144
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:28,31
and often, even marrying a local comes with its own challenges

145
0:5:28,31 --> 0:5:30,88
you still have to deal with various issues

146
0:5:30,88 --> 0:5:31,56
how to handle them

147
0:5:31,56 --> 0:5:33,44
but at least you don't have to worry about

148
0:5:33,44 --> 0:5:36,33
which family to visit during the Spring Festival

149
0:5:36,33 --> 0:5:38,25
this is a very practical concern

150
0:5:38,25 --> 0:5:40,25
so I recommend that you consider carefully

151
0:5:40,25 --> 0:5:42,29
Actually, there are deeper layers behind everything.

152
0:5:42,29 --> 0:5:45,5
The foundation of sociology is deeply rooted in existence.

153
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:46,53
So, when it comes to many things,

154
0:5:46,53 --> 0:5:49,45
I can't really experience the life of ordinary people in China,

155
0:5:49,45 --> 0:5:50,65
that kind of hardship,

156
0:5:50,65 --> 0:5:53,3
and that sense of where they come from.

157
0:5:53,3 --> 0:5:56,15
You'll find that in the real world, many who do cosplay,

158
0:5:56,15 --> 0:5:57,79
how should I put it,

159
0:5:57,79 --> 0:6:0,71
those who end up in borderline roles,

160
0:6:0,71 --> 0:6:3,63
whether on Douyin or our Bilibili platform,

161
0:6:3,63 --> 0:6:5,1
You see, a lot of people

162
0:6:5,1 --> 0:6:6,23
I'm not saying everyone

163
0:6:6,23 --> 0:6:10,21
I mean, a lot of them come from relatively humble beginnings

164
0:6:10,21 --> 0:6:13,15
often from rural families

165
0:6:13,15 --> 0:6:14,77
and they themselves are not given much attention

166
0:6:14,77 --> 0:6:17,87
and in their families, there's a preference for boys over girls

167
0:6:17,87 --> 0:6:20,69
and they are treated very, very unfairly

168
0:6:20,69 --> 0:6:23,44
so they mature really early

169
0:6:23,44 --> 0:6:24,28
and come to the city

170
0:6:24,28 --> 0:6:26,31
starting to work and struggle in society at a very young age

171
0:6:26,31 --> 0:6:28,35
Especially when it comes to romantic relationships

172
0:6:28,35 --> 0:6:30,31
These things have long been commonplace

173
0:6:30,31 --> 0:6:32,28
He has seen through everything long ago

174
0:6:32,28 --> 0:6:35,4
When you were in your teens, you were still in middle school

175
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:36,659
Still preparing for the high school and college entrance exams

176
0:6:36,659 --> 0:6:38,519
He might have already entered society

177
0:6:38,519 --> 0:6:40,759
So the intrigue and backstabbing he has witnessed

178
0:6:40,759 --> 0:6:42,159
The warmth and coldness of human relationships he has seen

179
0:6:42,159 --> 0:6:43,98
Far exceed what you have experienced

180
0:6:43,98 --> 0:6:45,22
So many times

181
0:6:45,22 --> 0:6:48,98
People shouldn't judge others just because they look about the same age.

182
0:6:48,98 --> 0:6:50,94
Or because they look similar in appearance.

183
0:6:50,94 --> 0:6:52,34
Just because someone else seems to be living a certain way,

184
0:6:52,34 --> 0:6:54,4
don't easily judge their life.

185
0:6:54,4 --> 0:6:57,22
We tend to think others should be just like us.

186
0:6:57,22 --> 0:6:58,34
Why aren't you being compassionate?

187
0:6:58,34 --> 0:7:0,3
Why don't you have time to be vegetarian?

188
0:7:0,3 --> 0:7:1,42
Many things are like this.

189
0:7:1,42 --> 0:7:4,84
People's experiences can't be fully empathized with by others.

190
0:7:4,84 --> 0:7:7,23
So it's best not to judge each other.

191
0:7:7,23 --> 0:7:8,99
On Bilibili,

192
0:7:8,99 --> 0:7:10,45
most of the time,

193
0:7:10,45 --> 0:7:13,99
Most of us belong to the intelligentsia.

194
0:7:13,99 --> 0:7:16,17
the majority of people on Bilibili,

195
0:7:16,17 --> 0:7:18,99
are capable of taking the college entrance exam,

196
0:7:18,99 --> 0:7:21,2
have participated in the college entrance exam,

197
0:7:21,2 --> 0:7:24,1
whether you attended a first-tier, second-tier, third-tier, or a 211, C9 university,

198
0:7:24,1 --> 0:7:25,96
or are a graduate student or a doctoral student,

199
0:7:25,96 --> 0:7:27,2
or an international student abroad,

200
0:7:27,2 --> 0:7:28,36
or any other educational background

201
0:7:28,36 --> 0:7:30,76
Whether you're a student from a domestic vocational college or a student who has upgraded from a junior college to a bachelor's program

202
0:7:30,76 --> 0:7:33,16
you are all products of higher education

203
0:7:33,16 --> 0:7:36,21
I've mentioned this population ratio several times

204
0:7:36,21 --> 0:7:37,61
the data might not be entirely accurate

205
0:7:37,61 --> 0:7:39,77
but this time I'm giving you the highest estimate

206
0:7:39,77 --> 0:7:40,63
6.2%

207
0:7:40,63 --> 0:7:43,1
which means the proportion in the total population

208
0:7:43,1 --> 0:7:44,77
is actually not that high

209
0:7:44,97 --> 0:7:48,539
there aren't many people in China with a general scientific literacy

210
0:7:48,539 --> 0:7:51,879
That's why my slice has that vibe on Douyin.

211
0:7:51,879 --> 0:7:54,409
It's completely different from what's on Bilibili

212
0:7:54,409 --> 0:7:56,889
Because on Douyin, people's attention spans are very short

213
0:7:56,889 --> 0:8:0,549
If you make things too complicated, they won't understand

214
0:8:0,549 --> 0:8:3,539
But on Bilibili, you can explain complex ideas

215
0:8:3,539 --> 0:8:6,339
And people on Bilibili, they even criticize others

216
0:8:6,339 --> 0:8:7,639
What do they say about me?

217
0:8:7,639 --> 0:8:9,59
They say I spread false information

218
0:8:9,59 --> 0:8:10,33
What else do they say about me?

219
0:8:10,33 --> 0:8:12,95
They say this disrespects the people's historical perspective

220
0:8:12,95 --> 0:8:16,76
Or they wonder if I've been paid by foreign entities

221
0:8:16,76 --> 0:8:20,12
Otherwise, it's all about your inaccurate expressions

222
0:8:20,12 --> 0:8:22,5
This is all about the disputes among literati

223
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:24,36
This is all part of the intelligentsia's.

224
0:8:24,36 --> 0:8:27,72
Why don't you have that kind of ancestral greeting

225
0:8:27,72 --> 0:8:29,44
It's rare for 18 generations

226
0:8:29,44 --> 0:8:30,25
Very rare

227
0:8:30,25 --> 0:8:32,21
Most people are just saying

228
0:8:32,21 --> 0:8:33,69
You're spreading heresies

229
0:8:33,69 --> 0:8:35,9
Such things are somewhat

230
0:8:35,9 --> 0:8:37,87
Because what the literati argue over is the truth

231
0:8:37,87 --> 0:8:39,39
What we're debating is your logic.

232
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:40,95
Your logic is flawed, isn't it?

233
0:8:40,95 --> 0:8:42,53
Your argument is not valid.

234
0:8:42,53 --> 0:8:44,749
The sample space you provided is incorrect.

235
0:8:44,749 --> 0:8:46,289
You haven't set up this group.

236
0:8:46,289 --> 0:8:47,749
So everything you're saying is like this.

237
0:8:47,749 --> 0:8:48,549
So it proves that...

238
0:8:48,549 --> 0:8:51,89
The cultural level of Bilibili users is relatively high.

239
0:8:51,89 --> 0:8:54,25
They are people with basic scientific literacy.

240
0:8:54,25 --> 0:8:56,3
They have at least completed high school.

241
0:8:56,3 --> 0:8:58,21
So, in most cases, this is different

242
0:8:58,21 --> 0:8:59,37
One situation stands out as unique

243
0:8:59,37 --> 0:9:0,77
Why do we need to discuss this today?

244
0:9:0,77 --> 0:9:3,319
When it comes to the many aspects of human interaction

245
0:9:3,319 --> 0:9:6,879
The empathy gap between you and others can't be bridged

246
0:9:6,879 --> 0:9:8,359
Because your backgrounds are different

247
0:9:8,359 --> 0:9:9,94
Our origins compared to those of ancient people

248
0:9:9,94 --> 0:9:11,58
The social environments of life and death were different

249
0:9:11,58 --> 0:9:14,1
Ancient people also varied among themselves

250
0:9:14,1 --> 0:9:16,29
So when we try to understand others today

251
0:9:16,29 --> 0:9:17,25
Make sure you think it through.

252
0:9:17,25 --> 0:9:21,6
Consider the actual audience's genuine acceptance level.

253
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:22,86
So sometimes when you do something,

254
0:9:22,86 --> 0:9:24,62
Why should crosstalk be vulgar?

255
0:9:24,62 --> 0:9:26,55
Because the people who listen to crosstalk are vulgar.

256
0:9:26,55 --> 0:9:29,79
Why do talk shows often focus on stories about students?

257
0:9:29,79 --> 0:9:33,3
Because people who study and listen to talk shows, relatively speaking,

258
0:9:33,3 --> 0:9:35,53
have a slightly higher level of education.

259
0:9:35,53 --> 0:9:38,339
Really, just slightly higher.

260
0:9:38,339 --> 0:9:40,619
Because ethical jokes might be less common.

261
0:9:40,619 --> 0:9:44,12
It's more of a vivid reenactment of personal experiences.

262
0:9:44,12 --> 0:9:46,52
So this inherently determines that, of course,

263
0:9:46,52 --> 0:9:47,54
Let's talk about the talk show.

264
0:9:47,54 --> 0:9:48,2
Stand-up comedy,

265
0:9:48,2 --> 0:9:48,84
In foreign countries,

266
0:9:48,84 --> 0:9:50,48
It's a very down-to-earth art form.

267
0:9:50,48 --> 0:9:52,36
But in China, it's different.

268
0:9:52,36 --> 0:9:54,56
Those who do talk shows are also highly educated.

269
0:9:54,56 --> 0:9:56,18
So when it comes to crosstalk performers,

270
0:9:56,18 --> 0:9:57,86
They are typically college graduates.

271
0:9:57,86 --> 0:10:0,1
There might not be a very high level of academic degree

272
0:10:0,1 --> 0:10:2,23
Perhaps just a junior college or an art school

273
0:10:2,23 --> 0:10:4,83
Graduating from a drama school is already considered a high level

274
0:10:4,83 --> 0:10:7,34
So this is a matter of cultural attainment

275
0:10:7,34 --> 0:10:9,3
That's why we often don't understand

276
0:10:9,3 --> 0:10:11,46
Why these old folks watch these short dramas

277
0:10:11,46 --> 0:10:13,38
Oh, all sorts of domineering CEOs and such

278
0:10:13,38 --> 0:10:15,9
The things written in web novels are so exaggerated

279
0:10:15,9 --> 0:10:17,14
How can they still enjoy watching them

280
0:10:18,14 --> 0:10:20,74
Because the audience isn't you

281
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:22,3
Why do you like me?

282
0:10:22,3 --> 0:10:23,48
Because when I talk to you,

283
0:10:23,48 --> 0:10:26,0
we are in the same social class,

284
0:10:26,0 --> 0:10:28,48
we are in the same knowledge class.

285
0:10:28,48 --> 0:10:30,44
Why is it that when it comes to my things

286
0:10:30,44 --> 0:10:32,32
Why does it not get out there as much?

287
0:10:32,32 --> 0:10:34,52
Why does the authority allow me to keep saying this?

288
0:10:34,52 --> 0:10:38,5
It’s because the people who actually hear me out,

289
0:10:38,5 --> 0:10:41,0
aren’t the ones who cause trouble,

290
0:10:41,0 --> 0:10:42,5
aren’t the ones who don’t listen.

291
0:10:42,5 --> 0:10:45,2
Those people can't understand such profound things.

292
0:10:45,2 --> 0:10:48,44
And only someone like you would come to the city.

293
0:10:48,44 --> 0:10:51,6
One choice is whether to start a business.

294
0:10:51,6 --> 0:10:53,89
Whether to continue on a professional path.

295
0:10:53,89 --> 0:10:55,5
So let me tell you,

296
0:10:55,5 --> 0:10:56,29
This isn't casting pearls before swine.

297
0:10:56,29 --> 0:10:57,61
This is like high mountains and flowing water.

298
0:10:57,61 --> 0:11:0,9
This is something that truly makes a difference in your life.

299
0:11:0,9 --> 0:11:4,62
Is it the same when I talk to someone who has been a chef since childhood?

300
0:11:4,62 --> 0:11:4,94
Right?

301
0:11:4,94 --> 0:11:7,2
But I'm not saying we have a top chef.

302
0:11:7,2 --> 0:11:8,81
But let me tell you.

303
0:11:8,81 --> 0:11:11,49
Often, people from different backgrounds.

304
0:11:11,49 --> 0:11:12,69
Talking to them is pointless.

305
0:11:12,69 --> 0:11:14,73
You can't change their destiny.

306
0:11:14,73 --> 0:11:16,45
That destiny is hard to alter.

307
0:11:16,45 --> 0:11:19,1
It might just be their lot in life.

308
0:11:19,1 --> 0:11:22,4
That's why some people like my stuff

309
0:11:22,4 --> 0:11:23,24
Some people dislike my stuff

310
0:11:23,24 --> 0:11:26,24
It's because they might not need it in their lives.

311
0:11:26,24 --> 0:11:28,32
Maybe he'll need it in his next life.

312
0:11:28,32 --> 0:11:30,36
Maybe their life is very happy.

313
0:11:30,36 --> 0:11:32,2
They don't need these things.

314
0:11:32,2 --> 0:11:33,8
So when it comes to these things,

315
0:11:33,8 --> 0:11:37,75
It means the stories are specifically told to those who are willing to listen.

316
0:11:37,75 --> 0:11:39,59
Those who think about such matters.

317
0:11:39,59 --> 0:11:42,9
So these things don't include the books I write.

318
0:11:42,9 --> 0:11:44,9
They are written for a select few.

319
0:11:44,9 --> 0:11:46,5
But most people can read them.

320
0:11:46,5 --> 0:11:47,71
Most people can read them for entertainment.

321
0:11:47,71 --> 0:11:50,17
But only a few people really listened.

322
0:11:50,17 --> 0:11:52,65
He serves as a kind of executor.

323
0:11:52,65 --> 0:11:54,93
This logic was put into action.

324
0:11:54,93 --> 0:11:55,95
This is different.

325
0:11:55,95 --> 0:11:57,41
So many things are like this.

326
0:11:57,41 --> 0:12:0,56
People cannot accurately empathize with each other.

327
0:12:0,56 --> 0:12:3,94
The people you can empathize with are those who share your background.

328
0:12:3,94 --> 0:12:5,9
Or have a similar background.

329
0:12:5,9 --> 0:12:7,13
That's what I said.

330
0:12:7,13 --> 0:12:9,49
urban intelligentsia

331
0:12:9,49 --> 0:12:13,97
This is something most people can share a common theory about with me.

332
0:12:13,97 --> 0:12:16,54
So, a lot of times when you say,

333
0:12:16,54 --> 0:12:17,94
I'm not part of the urban class,

334
0:12:17,94 --> 0:12:19,28
I come from a remote rural area.

335
0:12:19,28 --> 0:12:22,31
But now you're in the city, right?

336
0:12:22,31 --> 0:12:24,19
You didn't stay in the countryside all the time,

337
0:12:24,19 --> 0:12:24,99
If you stayed in the countryside all the time,

338
0:12:24,99 --> 0:12:26,23
You won't be looking at my stuff either.

339
0:12:26,23 --> 0:12:27,79
He asked why you would say that.

340
0:12:27,79 --> 0:12:31,71
I mean, our content is tailored for who we're addressing.

341
0:12:31,71 --> 0:12:33,57
Because the people at a lower level

342
0:12:33,57 --> 0:12:36,81
can't break through their labor class

343
0:12:36,81 --> 0:12:38,91
they are now thinking about basic sustenance

344
0:12:38,91 --> 0:12:42,89
they are now thinking about how to survive

345
0:12:42,89 --> 0:12:44,27
which is very crucial

346
0:12:44,27 --> 0:12:45,99
so in our theory

347
0:12:45,99 --> 0:12:47,3
for anyone

348
0:12:47,3 --> 0:12:49,79
it's not lacking in universality

349
0:12:49,79 --> 0:12:53,8
it only applies to a very narrow range

350
0:12:53,8 --> 0:12:54,369
a very small group of people

351
0:12:54,369 --> 0:12:57,869
So, these people on Bilibili truly have a promising future

352
0:12:57,869 --> 0:12:59,27
as entrepreneurs

353
0:12:59,27 --> 0:13:2,61
because your level of knowledge will match your level of assets

354
0:13:2,61 --> 0:13:5,47
if you manage to save and earn normally

355
0:13:5,47 --> 0:13:6,27
it can also be achieved

356
0:13:6,27 --> 0:13:7,66
but as we've mentioned

357
0:13:7,66 --> 0:13:8,66
I often say

358
0:13:8,66 --> 0:13:10,18
don't engage in high-end consumption

359
0:13:10,18 --> 0:13:11,74
but the country is encouraging consumption

360
0:13:11,74 --> 0:13:12,4
why is that

361
0:13:12,4 --> 0:13:13,2
Right?

362
0:13:13,2 --> 0:13:13,82
Why is that?

363
0:13:13,82 --> 0:13:15,44
Because consumption can boost the economy.

364
0:13:15,44 --> 0:13:16,37
It's quite normal.

365
0:13:16,37 --> 0:13:17,63
I've said that before.

366
0:13:17,63 --> 0:13:19,53
Buying a house is a strategic decision.

367
0:13:19,53 --> 0:13:20,77
Some areas are on the rise.

368
0:13:20,77 --> 0:13:21,71
While others are declining.

369
0:13:21,71 --> 0:13:24,12
Let's adjust our asset allocation.

370
0:13:24,12 --> 0:13:26,58
We just need to make sure the places we buy in are on the rise.

371
0:13:26,58 --> 0:13:27,94
We'll sell when it drops.

372
0:13:27,94 --> 0:13:29,96
So these are all strategic statements.

373
0:13:29,96 --> 0:13:32,16
It's not like you've been co-opted, Rongzhen.

374
0:13:32,16 --> 0:13:33,77
Now you only dare to say these things.

375
0:13:33,77 --> 0:13:34,87
No problem at all.

376
0:13:34,87 --> 0:13:36,75
Actually, they can coexist without contradiction.

377
0:13:36,75 --> 0:13:39,2
Because for someone about to start a business,

378
0:13:39,2 --> 0:13:40,42
you obviously need to save money.

379
0:13:40,42 --> 0:13:40,98
Right?

380
0:13:40,98 --> 0:13:41,6
Of course.

381
0:13:41,6 --> 0:13:43,48
If I could just be happy all my life,

382
0:13:43,48 --> 0:13:45,18
then it's a matter of where to spend the money,

383
0:13:45,18 --> 0:13:45,71
right?

384
0:13:45,71 --> 0:13:47,39
So if you're not going to spend it here,

385
0:13:47,39 --> 0:13:48,99
you could travel abroad every day,

386
0:13:48,99 --> 0:13:50,71
and you wouldn't spend it domestically.

387
0:13:50,71 --> 0:13:51,35
So, to put it simply,

388
0:13:51,35 --> 0:13:54,349
a lot of things come down to who earns whose money,

389
0:13:54,349 --> 0:13:57,78
so the logic for ordinary people is naturally production,

390
0:13:57,78 --> 0:13:58,78
labor and consumption.

391
0:13:58,78 --> 0:14:0,6
This is a very common thing.

392
0:14:0,6 --> 0:14:2,58
But the question is whether you can take in what I say.

393
0:14:2,58 --> 0:14:4,869
Proving that you're not just an ordinary person.

394
0:14:5,69 --> 0:14:8,49
The books written by Luo Guanzhong weren't for the common folk, after all.

395
0:14:8,49 --> 0:14:8,589
Right?

396
0:14:8,589 --> 0:14:10,889
In ancient times, who could afford to buy books?

397
0:14:10,889 --> 0:14:12,95
Can you spare a few dozen minutes?

398
0:14:12,95 --> 0:14:14,83
In this video of mine,

399
0:14:14,83 --> 0:14:16,19
It's almost reached a thousand views,

400
0:14:16,19 --> 0:14:18,13
With 50 million plays.

401
0:14:18,13 --> 0:14:22,5
These things have taken hundreds of hours of effort from many people

402
0:14:22,5 --> 0:14:23,61
those who truly delve into it

403
0:14:23,61 --> 0:14:24,79
those who really watch it

404
0:14:24,79 --> 0:14:27,24
some who don’t miss a single episode

405
0:14:27,24 --> 0:14:28,4
and some who wonder why

406
0:14:28,4 --> 0:14:30,48
it’s because you are different

407
0:14:30,48 --> 0:14:32,64
don’t underestimate yourself

408
0:14:32,64 --> 0:14:35,7
never think you’re not good enough

409
0:14:35,7 --> 0:14:36,98
or that you lack skill

410
0:14:36,98 --> 0:14:39,38
you are among the elite in China

411
0:14:39,38 --> 0:14:41,44
Perhaps you are not a scientific elite

412
0:14:41,44 --> 0:14:43,4
Perhaps you are not an economic elite

413
0:14:43,4 --> 0:14:45,8
Perhaps you are not a sports star

414
0:14:45,8 --> 0:14:47,91
But among the vast population of China

415
0:14:47,91 --> 0:14:50,71
Can you hear what I'm saying?

416
0:14:50,71 --> 0:14:51,91
You can grasp the meaning of these words

417
0:14:51,91 --> 0:14:55,9
You can delve deeper to identify logical flaws

418
0:14:55,9 --> 0:14:58,3
This proves you are a well-learned person

419
0:14:58,3 --> 0:15:1,42
You would at least be qualified to participate in the imperial examinations in ancient times

420
0:15:1,42 --> 0:15:3,12
That is quite significant

421
0:15:3,12 --> 0:15:5,39
That's because you are unique.

422
0:15:5,39 --> 0:15:7,11
So don't feel that way.

423
0:15:7,11 --> 0:15:7,81
You mean me?

424
0:15:7,81 --> 0:15:10,59
I might not have the financial strength right now.

425
0:15:10,59 --> 0:15:11,83
I don't have much.

426
0:15:11,83 --> 0:15:13,15
I can't change my fate.

427
0:15:13,15 --> 0:15:14,63
I didn't do well on my postgraduate exam.

428
0:15:14,63 --> 0:15:15,43
I'm a failure.

429
0:15:15,43 --> 0:15:17,1
That's absolutely not true, you are not a failure.

430
0:15:17,1 --> 0:15:19,23
After going through the gauntlet of the college entrance exam,

431
0:15:19,23 --> 0:15:20,53
You're not a failure anymore.

432
0:15:20,53 --> 0:15:21,93
You're no longer a failure.

433
0:15:21,93 --> 0:15:23,63
You've moved up from the ranks of the failures.

434
0:15:23,63 --> 0:15:26,94
We're talking about those who are truly struggling.

435
0:15:26,94 --> 0:15:28,82
The common folks who have a tough time.

436
0:15:28,82 --> 0:15:30,3
People who have it really hard.

437
0:15:30,3 --> 0:15:33,2
You haven't reached that level yet.

438
0:15:33,38 --> 0:15:35,66
You haven't reached the level of a master in Sanhe.

439
0:15:35,66 --> 0:15:37,18
Look at the master in Sanhe.

440
0:15:37,18 --> 0:15:38,64
You look down from above.

441
0:15:38,64 --> 0:15:40,44
You're not one to look up to.

442
0:15:40,44 --> 0:15:43,44
There are many who aren't even as good as Mr. Sanhe.

443
0:15:43,44 --> 0:15:45,36
Those who actually do daily jobs.

444
0:15:45,36 --> 0:15:46,96
Those who actually work in electronics factories.

445
0:15:46,96 --> 0:15:48,26
The real factory girls.

446
0:15:48,26 --> 0:15:49,88
You're not at that level.

447
0:15:49,88 --> 0:15:51,8
If you were at that level.

448
0:15:51,8 --> 0:15:53,26
And you watch Bilibili every day.

449
0:15:53,26 --> 0:15:55,44
You'd quickly rise above that level.

450
0:15:55,44 --> 0:15:57,76
Because Bilibili is a reflection of all walks of life.

451
0:15:57,76 --> 0:16:3,54
He presents to most people a middle-to-upper-level

452
0:16:3,54 --> 0:16:6,98
the middle to upper-middle class intelligentsia

453
0:16:6,98 --> 0:16:10,0
in their daily life

454
0:16:10,0 --> 0:16:11,34
in big cities

455
0:16:11,34 --> 0:16:12,94
their dining, entertainment, and leisure

456
0:16:12,94 --> 0:16:15,44
their indulgences and where they go for fun

457
0:16:15,44 --> 0:16:17,94
like many videos on Bilibili that show trips to Japan

458
0:16:17,94 --> 0:16:21,77
trips to North America, or taking all kinds of exams

459
0:16:21,77 --> 0:16:24,7
and how to participate in interviews

460
0:16:24,7 --> 0:16:25,81
or how to live their lives

461
0:16:25,81 --> 0:16:27,1
How to decorate?

462
0:16:27,1 --> 0:16:29,89
It portrays China's intelligentsia.

463
0:16:29,89 --> 0:16:32,92
and the daily life of the petite bourgeoisie

464
0:16:32,92 --> 0:16:34,76
You are an intellectual

465
0:16:34,76 --> 0:16:36,88
an urban youth and a member of the petite bourgeoisie

466
0:16:36,88 --> 0:16:38,8
No matter what you were before

467
0:16:38,8 --> 0:16:39,21
you are now

468
0:16:39,21 --> 0:16:41,59
That's why you can appreciate these things

469
0:16:41,59 --> 0:16:42,63
So let me tell you

470
0:16:42,63 --> 0:16:44,43
Let me use the example of horse prices

471
0:16:44,43 --> 0:16:46,93
You're always saying, look at you.

472
0:16:46,93 --> 0:16:47,73
Selfish and greedy.

473
0:16:47,73 --> 0:16:48,6
Selfish to the core.

474
0:16:48,6 --> 0:16:51,0
Because you know who Machiavelli is.

475
0:16:51,0 --> 0:16:54,8
You know that words ending in a vowel like Machiavelli’s name

476
0:16:54,8 --> 0:16:55,18
are definitely Italian.

477
0:16:55,18 --> 0:16:58,4
Or at least from a Latin-based culture, right?

478
0:16:58,4 --> 0:17:1,46
Like Domino Mario, for example.

479
0:17:1,46 --> 0:17:3,5
Words ending in a vowel are Latin.

480
0:17:3,5 --> 0:17:4,54
They are Italian.

481
0:17:4,54 --> 0:17:5,78
He's from the Roman lineage

482
0:17:5,78 --> 0:17:6,5
These people

483
0:17:6,5 --> 0:17:7,79
He's Italian

484
0:17:7,79 --> 0:17:9,19
You wouldn't ask that

485
0:17:9,19 --> 0:17:10,7
This Ma

486
0:17:10,7 --> 0:17:11,69
This person is from which province in the northwest

487
0:17:11,69 --> 0:17:12,67
You wouldn't phrase it like that

488
0:17:12,67 --> 0:17:14,94
You wouldn't ask if he's from Gansu or Ningxia

489
0:17:14,94 --> 0:17:19,56
Because you're someone who has received general scientific education

490
0:17:19,56 --> 0:17:22,69
You're the hope of China's quality education

491
0:17:22,69 --> 0:17:23,95
You have benefited from nine years of compulsory education

492
0:17:23,95 --> 0:17:27,17
enjoyed the nine-year compulsory education system and participated in twelve years of education

493
0:17:27,17 --> 0:17:28,75
and have even reached fifteen years of education

494
0:17:28,75 --> 0:17:31,11
which makes you different from the average person

495
0:17:31,11 --> 0:17:32,49
truly different

496
0:17:32,49 --> 0:17:35,35
you don't know what real life at the bottom is like

497
0:17:35,35 --> 0:17:36,51
you're not from the bottom

498
0:17:36,51 --> 0:17:40,95
and don't think that being poor and being destitute are the same

499
0:17:40,95 --> 0:17:43,15
being poor means having no hope of earning money

500
0:17:43,15 --> 0:17:44,47
absolutely no hope at all

501
0:17:44,47 --> 0:17:45,21
This is called poverty

502
0:17:45,21 --> 0:17:46,69
So the government needs to help the poor

503
0:17:46,69 --> 0:17:48,41
Being poor means having no money

504
0:17:48,41 --> 0:17:49,57
Having no money

505
0:17:49,57 --> 0:17:50,43
It's quite common

506
0:17:50,43 --> 0:17:52,74
People are often just broke

507
0:17:52,74 --> 0:17:54,22
What a good time to make money

508
0:17:54,22 --> 0:17:55,58
But it’s not always like that

509
0:17:55,58 --> 0:17:58,34
So you need to figure out how to make money even when times are tough

510
0:17:58,34 --> 0:17:59,95
So you can still earn a living

511
0:17:59,95 --> 0:18:1,33
So this is quite normal

512
0:18:1,33 --> 0:18:3,61
That's why the government is promoting consumption

513
0:18:3,61 --> 0:18:4,83
And boosting consumer spending

514
0:18:4,83 --> 0:18:5,75
To stimulate the economy

515
0:18:5,75 --> 0:18:7,51
This is a common thing

516
0:18:7,51 --> 0:18:9,75
I would say you need to increase income and cut expenses

517
0:18:9,75 --> 0:18:12,69
You need to prioritize things

518
0:18:12,69 --> 0:18:13,87
It's not about not spending

519
0:18:13,87 --> 0:18:15,76
But about when to do it

520
0:18:15,76 --> 0:18:17,9
When to spend and when to save

521
0:18:17,9 --> 0:18:19,72
When will we soar to new heights?

522
0:18:19,72 --> 0:18:22,2
To elevate our spending level

523
0:18:22,2 --> 0:18:23,4
To a higher economic class

524
0:18:23,4 --> 0:18:24,32
You look just like Brother Rong

525
0:18:24,32 --> 0:18:27,21
When we go out now, right?

526
0:18:27,21 --> 0:18:29,33
This can stimulate more economic activity

527
0:18:29,33 --> 0:18:31,37
It can boost our consumption level

528
0:18:31,37 --> 0:18:33,9
Didn't we used to spend a few hundred a day?

529
0:18:33,9 --> 0:18:35,44
Now we spend thousands or even tens of thousands a day

530
0:18:35,44 --> 0:18:35,98
Isn't that so?

531
0:18:35,98 --> 0:18:38,46
So this has benefits for the economy.

532
0:18:38,46 --> 0:18:40,22
So what we're talking about is...

533
0:18:40,22 --> 0:18:43,77
It's a form of delayed gratification, or how should I put it...

534
0:18:43,77 --> 0:18:46,59
Now that we've taken you up a step...

535
0:18:46,59 --> 0:18:48,42
It's even more beneficial for the national economy.

536
0:18:51,66 --> 0:18:53,56
There are many entrepreneurs.

537
0:18:53,56 --> 0:18:55,92
We can't rely on state-owned enterprises for everything.

538
0:18:55,92 --> 0:18:57,1
Or solely on state-owned companies.

539
0:18:57,1 --> 0:18:57,82
Government funding alone isn't enough.

540
0:18:57,82 --> 0:19:0,42
You need to boost the private sector.

541
0:19:0,42 --> 0:19:1,54
There need to be such people in the community

542
0:19:1,54 --> 0:19:3,0
to drive these industries forward

543
0:19:3,0 --> 0:19:5,889
you can't just hand over these industries to foreign capital

544
0:19:5,889 --> 0:19:9,64
You can't say that all money-making industries are controlled by the Brahman caste in the county town.

545
0:19:9,64 --> 0:19:11,4
controlled by foreign capital

546
0:19:11,4 --> 0:19:12,44
you need to have national entrepreneurs

547
0:19:12,44 --> 0:19:13,2
right?

548
0:19:13,2 --> 0:19:16,48
you can't rely on the state for everything, especially major undertakings

549
0:19:16,48 --> 0:19:19,12
like railway transportation, aerospace, and national defense

550
0:19:19,12 --> 0:19:22,2
you leave the smaller, detailed tasks to the state

551
0:19:22,2 --> 0:19:22,96
Some items

552
0:19:22,96 --> 0:19:23,76
A coffee shop

553
0:19:23,76 --> 0:19:25,95
Like, is it a massage parlor or something?

554
0:19:25,95 --> 0:19:26,47
A laundry

555
0:19:26,47 --> 0:19:28,71
These are things that individuals can run

556
0:19:28,71 --> 0:19:31,19
You can't let foreign conglomerates swallow everything up

557
0:19:31,19 --> 0:19:32,79
So this is normal

558
0:19:32,79 --> 0:19:34,27
When it comes to many of our things

559
0:19:34,27 --> 0:19:37,81
Don't say I don't encourage spending

560
0:19:37,81 --> 0:19:41,37
It's that I don't encourage you, someone who might become a boss in the future, to do so

561
0:19:41,37 --> 0:19:44,19
Now you're depleting your initial capital

562
0:19:44,19 --> 0:19:46,129
Isn't that right?

563
0:19:46,129 --> 0:19:48,829
I'm not talking about just any ordinary factory girl

564
0:19:48,829 --> 0:19:50,649
We're not spending on these anymore

565
0:19:50,649 --> 0:19:51,569
We're not even buying formula

566
0:19:51,569 --> 0:19:53,38
Not having kids is an option, right?

567
0:19:53,38 --> 0:19:56,8
I'm talking about you, you're different

568
0:19:56,8 --> 0:19:58,18
You deserve my encouragement

569
0:19:58,18 --> 0:19:59,14
You deserve my support

570
0:19:59,14 --> 0:20:1,2
Because you have the potential to move up in the future
