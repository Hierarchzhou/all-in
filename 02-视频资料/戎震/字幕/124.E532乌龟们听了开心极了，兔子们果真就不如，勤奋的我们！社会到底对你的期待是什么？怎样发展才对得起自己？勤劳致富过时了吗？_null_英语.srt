0:0:0,7 --> 0:0:1,38
Hi everyone

2
0:0:1,38 --> 0:0:3,58
I'm back at the familiar hotel setting

3
0:0:3,58 --> 0:0:7,42
In this episode, I'll continue to talk about chatting with him

4
0:0:7,42 --> 0:0:9,72
Today, we're going to talk about something really interesting

5
0:0:9,72 --> 0:0:11,66
It's the story of the Tortoise and the Hare

6
0:0:11,66 --> 0:0:13,38
The story of the Tortoise and the Hare

7
0:0:13,38 --> 0:0:14,5
From when we were kids

8
0:0:14,5 --> 0:0:16,82
Teachers from our generation, like us Gen Xers, used to tell us

9
0:0:16,82 --> 0:0:18,439
Stories like the slow bird that flies early

10
0:0:18,439 --> 0:0:19,819
Waiting by the stump for a rabbit

11
0:0:19,819 --> 0:0:20,899
Diligence can make up for lack of ability

12
0:0:20,899 --> 0:0:22,379
It’s telling you not to be lazy

13
0:0:22,379 --> 0:0:23,179
To be hardworking

14
0:0:23,179 --> 0:0:24,179
But let me tell you

15
0:0:24,179 --> 0:0:28,44
Actually, the U.S. promotes joyful learning while we promote diligent education

16
0:0:28,44 --> 0:0:32,3
The core characteristics are actually quite similar

17
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:33,27
Why do I say they’re similar?

18
0:0:33,27 --> 0:0:35,51
Because the end result is the same

19
0:0:35,51 --> 0:0:38,43
Many people always think, how should I put it,

20
0:0:38,43 --> 0:0:41,74
when it comes to diligence,

21
0:0:41,74 --> 0:0:43,6
it ultimately does pay off.

22
0:0:43,6 --> 0:0:43,98
But I've said before,

23
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:45,7
when we talk about diligence,

24
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:47,2
we mean the diligence of a genius.

25
0:0:47,2 --> 0:0:48,66
If you're not a genius,

26
0:0:48,66 --> 0:0:50,8
your hard work actually doesn't make much difference.

27
0:0:50,8 --> 0:0:52,92
That 1% of talent is still very important.

28
0:0:52,92 --> 0:0:54,52
For example, the story of the Tortoise and the Hare

29
0:0:54,52 --> 0:0:56,4
Did the hare lose in the end?

30
0:0:56,4 --> 0:0:58,82
The hare only lost one race

31
0:0:58,82 --> 0:1:1,5
This race seemed to be won by the tortoise

32
0:1:1,5 --> 0:1:4,2
But from any perspective

33
0:1:4,2 --> 0:1:5,5
The tortoise always runs

34
0:1:5,5 --> 0:1:6,98
It can never outrun the hare

35
0:1:6,98 --> 0:1:8,86
Even if you start earlier

36
0:1:8,86 --> 0:1:10,5
Even if you find 100 clones

37
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:13,109
Your innate abilities still fall short of the rabbit's.

38
0:1:13,109 --> 0:1:16,69
Everyone should look for a courier in a large forest.

39
0:1:16,69 --> 0:1:17,979
Wouldn't you all still choose the rabbit?

40
0:1:17,979 --> 0:1:19,939
If you need to burn something,

41
0:1:19,939 --> 0:1:21,399
you'd also pick the rabbit for the job.

42
0:1:21,399 --> 0:1:23,99
So, we're talking about your weaknesses.

43
0:1:23,99 --> 0:1:25,86
Even if you try to make up for them through hard work,

44
0:1:25,86 --> 0:1:27,24
when you compete with others,

45
0:1:27,24 --> 0:1:29,44
you still wouldn't stand a chance.

46
0:1:29,44 --> 0:1:31,7
This is how we achieve a class leap.

47
0:1:31,7 --> 0:1:34,31
You know, I'm 41 now.

48
0:1:34,31 --> 0:1:37,1
I've started to dive deep into nuclear physics.

49
0:1:37,1 --> 0:1:39,15
Do you think I can become a nuclear physics expert?

50
0:1:39,15 --> 0:1:40,51
Obviously, that's not possible.

51
0:1:40,51 --> 0:1:43,55
So, if you could have done it when you were young,

52
0:1:43,55 --> 0:1:45,56
why didn't you do it back then?

53
0:1:45,56 --> 0:1:47,14
Why would it be possible now that you're older?

54
0:1:47,14 --> 0:1:47,58
Right?

55
0:1:47,58 --> 0:1:50,56
The senior university is actually meant to comfort people’s hearts.

56
0:1:50,56 --> 0:1:53,3
The so-called talents are actually just selected.

57
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:54,8
A turtle is a turtle.

58
0:1:54,8 --> 0:1:55,2
A rabbit is a rabbit.

59
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:56,92
What should the turtle compete with humans?

60
0:1:56,92 --> 0:1:58,56
It should compete in longevity.

61
0:1:58,56 --> 0:2:0,96
It should compete in having a hard shell.

62
0:2:0,96 --> 0:2:3,1
It shouldn’t compete in speed.

63
0:2:3,1 --> 0:2:5,1
The fast rabbit is indeed fast.

64
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:6,36
In the end, it turned out to be a rabbit's head.

65
0:2:6,36 --> 0:2:7,12
Right?

66
0:2:7,12 --> 0:2:9,41
What about the turtle? What should the turtle be like?

67
0:2:9,41 --> 0:2:11,17
The turtle should leverage its own strengths.

68
0:2:11,17 --> 0:2:14,15
So many of us, when we were young,

69
0:2:14,15 --> 0:2:15,39
liked our teachers,

70
0:2:15,39 --> 0:2:16,33
and would often say,

71
0:2:16,33 --> 0:2:18,59
Look at this student; his family is wealthy,

72
0:2:18,59 --> 0:2:19,23
but he doesn’t do well in studies.

73
0:2:19,23 --> 0:2:21,85
What kind of job will he be able to find in the future, right?

74
0:2:21,85 --> 0:2:24,14
He doesn't even need to look for a job.

75
0:2:24,14 --> 0:2:25,72
So, in many cases,

76
0:2:25,72 --> 0:2:28,919
the differences in family background and talent,

77
0:2:28,919 --> 0:2:29,659
as the saying goes, 'dragons give birth to dragons,]

78
0:2:29,659 --> 0:2:31,219
and phoenixes give birth to phoenixes',

79
0:2:31,219 --> 0:2:34,35
these differences cannot be made up for by hard work later in life.

80
0:2:34,35 --> 0:2:35,95
He puts it to you like this,

81
0:2:35,95 --> 0:2:38,71
look, you're doing better in studies than those classmates from wealthy families.

82
0:2:38,71 --> 0:2:42,7
At its core, it's a way to comfort you.

83
0:2:42,84 --> 0:2:45,56
After all, people have already accumulated wealth or resources over two or three generations.

84
0:2:45,56 --> 0:2:47,56
Why should they be considered less hardworking than your single generation?

85
0:2:47,56 --> 0:2:48,64
And everyone needs to understand,

86
0:2:48,64 --> 0:2:50,959
defying the odds and changing one's fate is only suitable for a select few.

87
0:2:50,959 --> 0:2:53,479
Some people talk about those at the top,

88
0:2:53,479 --> 0:2:56,479
who got into C9 universities like Tsinghua or Peking University,

89
0:2:56,479 --> 0:2:58,1
and then went abroad to pursue a Ph.D.,

90
0:2:58,1 --> 0:3:1,14
and ended up working in Silicon Valley.

91
0:3:1,14 --> 0:3:4,1
He made a leap from a small village to this social class.

92
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:5,14
But speaking of him personally,

93
0:3:5,14 --> 0:3:8,22
even though he was born into a humble background,

94
0:3:8,22 --> 0:3:9,76
his intelligence level was sufficient.

95
0:3:9,76 --> 0:3:11,269
That’s because his genes were good.

96
0:3:11,269 --> 0:3:12,429
So, fundamentally speaking,

97
0:3:12,429 --> 0:3:14,889
we say one's origin determines everything.

98
0:3:14,889 --> 0:3:15,789
One's origin determines everything.

99
0:3:15,789 --> 0:3:17,949
Does that mean we don’t need to strive in our later years?

100
0:3:17,949 --> 0:3:21,149
It's not about competing in a race with others the day after tomorrow

101
0:3:21,149 --> 0:3:23,87
but rather analyzing your own characteristics

102
0:3:23,87 --> 0:3:26,35
What exactly are my unique traits?

103
0:3:26,35 --> 0:3:29,6
What unique qualities does my species possess?

104
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:30,92
What value can be derived from them?

105
0:3:30,92 --> 0:3:33,43
Where should I be making my contribution?

106
0:3:33,43 --> 0:3:35,39
From a national perspective, talent

107
0:3:35,39 --> 0:3:37,15
is selected through a process

108
0:3:37,15 --> 0:3:39,56
we need to ensure we have the most outstanding talent

109
0:3:39,56 --> 0:3:41,62
We don’t care if his name is Zhang San or Li Si

110
0:3:41,62 --> 0:3:42,63
It doesn’t matter

111
0:3:42,63 --> 0:3:45,9
As long as we, from a societal perspective

112
0:3:45,9 --> 0:3:46,87
Maintain a certain number of top talents

113
0:3:46,87 --> 0:3:48,27
Who can contribute to scientific research

114
0:3:48,27 --> 0:3:49,6
Contribute to engineering

115
0:3:49,6 --> 0:3:50,72
Contribute to finance

116
0:3:50,72 --> 0:3:52,68
And contribute to military and other fields

117
0:3:52,68 --> 0:3:54,88
Our talent pool just needs to be large enough

118
0:3:54,88 --> 0:3:56,959
He can pick out any kind of talent.

119
0:3:56,959 --> 0:3:58,839
But when it comes to ourselves,

120
0:3:58,839 --> 0:4:0,599
we can't just believe blindly.

121
0:4:0,599 --> 0:4:1,439
Hard work makes up for lack of talent.

122
0:4:1,439 --> 0:4:2,98
The early bird catches the worm.

123
0:4:3,14 --> 0:4:5,3
You can never outdo a genius no matter how hard you try.

124
0:4:5,3 --> 0:4:6,5
When you were in middle school,

125
0:4:6,5 --> 0:4:7,74
you couldn't outdo the math prodigy,

126
0:4:7,74 --> 0:4:8,34
or the physics prodigy.

127
0:4:8,34 --> 0:4:8,98
an English prodigy

128
0:4:8,98 --> 0:4:9,73
right or wrong

129
0:4:9,73 --> 0:4:11,13
well, to be honest

130
0:4:11,13 --> 0:4:13,17
each province has its own natural disasters

131
0:4:13,17 --> 0:4:14,59
each county has its own natural disasters

132
0:4:14,59 --> 0:4:16,87
every school and every class has its own top student

133
0:4:16,87 --> 0:4:19,37
so don’t try to compete with the top student

134
0:4:19,37 --> 0:4:21,87
even if he’s well-known in your area

135
0:4:21,87 --> 0:4:25,57
he might not necessarily stand out at the national level

136
0:4:25,57 --> 0:4:28,57
So we say that talent selection is a very harsh process.

137
0:4:28,57 --> 0:4:30,41
But for a populous country,

138
0:4:30,41 --> 0:4:32,9
being able to select the best talent

139
0:4:32,9 --> 0:4:33,76
is of utmost importance to the nation.

140
0:4:33,76 --> 0:4:36,38
As long as we have a large enough population base,

141
0:4:36,38 --> 0:4:37,96
we can always select the best individuals.

142
0:4:37,96 --> 0:4:40,14
But what should we, the people at the back, do?

143
0:4:40,14 --> 0:4:42,669
You shouldn't try to follow the path of a genius.

144
0:4:42,669 --> 0:4:44,469
This is what you should do.

145
0:4:44,469 --> 0:4:45,869
I'm not saying you're not a genius

146
0:4:45,869 --> 0:4:46,749
but that's the problem

147
0:4:46,749 --> 0:4:49,45
you just might not be a sprinting genius

148
0:4:49,45 --> 0:4:50,93
you're just not a rabbit

149
0:4:50,93 --> 0:4:52,69
you can't compete with a rabbit in math

150
0:4:52,69 --> 0:4:53,17
or in physics

151
0:4:53,17 --> 0:4:55,21
but you might be better than a rabbit in English

152
0:4:55,21 --> 0:4:56,62
you might be better in literature

153
0:4:56,62 --> 0:4:58,1
you might be better at business

154
0:4:58,1 --> 0:4:59,4
You might have better stamina

155
0:4:59,4 --> 0:5:0,84
You might live longer

156
0:5:0,84 --> 0:5:2,53
These are all advantages

157
0:5:2,53 --> 0:5:5,53
So don't act like in the story of Tian Ji's horse racing

158
0:5:5,53 --> 0:5:8,48
Don’t compare your weaknesses with others’ strengths

159
0:5:8,48 --> 0:5:11,3
Comparing your weaknesses with others’ strengths will surely lead to failure

160
0:5:11,3 --> 0:5:13,78
That’s why the saying 'diligence can make up for clumsiness' means

161
0:5:13,78 --> 0:5:15,52
It refers to some weaknesses

162
0:5:15,52 --> 0:5:18,2
What you need to do is focus on how to leverage your efforts

163
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:19,96
You can reach an average level compared to others

164
0:5:19,96 --> 0:5:22,39
but that’s only reaching an average level

165
0:5:22,39 --> 0:5:25,279
what truly sets you apart from others is your strength

166
0:5:25,279 --> 0:5:27,359
so when it comes to the story itself

167
0:5:27,359 --> 0:5:29,2
the direction it leads us is problematic

168
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:31,64
it means that we Chinese believe in hard work

169
0:5:31,64 --> 0:5:33,76
that it can solve all problems

170
0:5:33,76 --> 0:5:36,68
but hard work is often another term for

171
0:5:36,68 --> 0:5:38,3
being overworked

172
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:41,59
Just focusing on the effort without considering the direction of development is meaningless.

173
0:5:41,59 --> 0:5:44,69
Just comparing your strengths with others’ is not going to work.

174
0:5:44,69 --> 0:5:46,32
That’s also pointless.

175
0:5:46,32 --> 0:5:47,94
It’s like chasing a car with a tricycle.

176
0:5:47,94 --> 0:5:48,72
Right?

177
0:5:48,72 --> 0:5:51,14
It’s like comparing the resources of one province with those of an entire country.

178
0:5:51,14 --> 0:5:52,48
There’s no way that would work out.

179
0:5:52,48 --> 0:5:53,68
So, in many cases,

180
0:5:53,68 --> 0:5:57,2
we emphasize the importance of first identifying the right direction for our efforts.

181
0:5:57,2 --> 0:5:58,29
Is that right?

182
0:5:58,29 --> 0:5:59,65
And we've said,

183
0:5:59,65 --> 0:6:1,49
What a business should really be like

184
0:6:1,49 --> 0:6:3,13
It's not about how hard you work

185
0:6:3,13 --> 0:6:5,26
There's this person who opened a KFC coffee shop

186
0:6:5,26 --> 0:6:6,26
But the business isn't doing well

187
0:6:6,26 --> 0:6:8,36
Does sitting there every day really help?

188
0:6:8,36 --> 0:6:9,8
Sitting there every day

189
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:10,82
Recite the Heart Sutra twice

190
0:6:10,82 --> 0:6:11,46
Copy it twice

191
0:6:11,46 --> 0:6:13,0
Is this Sutra of the Earth Store effective?

192
0:6:13,0 --> 0:6:14,6
This is about putting in effort

193
0:6:14,6 --> 0:6:15,52
Is this the right direction?

194
0:6:15,52 --> 0:6:17,789
Should you be doing this at this time?

195
0:6:17,789 --> 0:6:19,589
Business is about running a business

196
0:6:19,589 --> 0:6:22,38
So often, we say it’s because your effort is misdirected

197
0:6:22,38 --> 0:6:24,32
How exactly should a business be run?

198
0:6:24,32 --> 0:6:26,26
We’ve talked about a very simple concept

199
0:6:26,26 --> 0:6:29,76
It's the human needs that give rise to products and services.

200
0:6:29,76 --> 0:6:32,1
For example, the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S.

201
0:6:32,1 --> 0:6:33,24
This trade war

202
0:6:33,24 --> 0:6:35,85
creates a significant demand gap.

203
0:6:35,85 --> 0:6:39,23
So, platforms like DHgate step in to fill this gap.

204
0:6:39,23 --> 0:6:40,21
Of course,

205
0:6:40,21 --> 0:6:43,21
if DHgate didn't exist or ceased operations daily,

206
0:6:43,21 --> 0:6:45,73
the massive demand would still be there,

207
0:6:45,73 --> 0:6:49,45
and countless middlemen, new apps, and new methods would emerge.

208
0:6:49,45 --> 0:6:53,47
This allows American customers to access products from China.

209
0:6:53,47 --> 0:6:57,96
So, this represents a huge demand and a huge supply.

210
0:6:57,96 --> 0:6:59,52
That's what it generates.

211
0:6:59,52 --> 0:7:1,42
A service and a product.

212
0:7:1,42 --> 0:7:3,8
So, it’s either a product,

213
0:7:3,8 --> 0:7:3,96
or a service.

214
0:7:3,96 --> 0:7:5,2
The app itself is a product,

215
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:6,6
and also a service.

216
0:7:6,6 --> 0:7:7,98
So, to delve deeper into it,

217
0:7:7,98 --> 0:7:10,18
We need to think about the world today

218
0:7:10,18 --> 0:7:12,33
Where changes are constant and unpredictable

219
0:7:12,33 --> 0:7:14,17
There's a new conflict between India and Pakistan

220
0:7:14,17 --> 0:7:16,25
This will create new demands

221
0:7:16,25 --> 0:7:17,73
A place has been hit by a major blizzard

222
0:7:17,73 --> 0:7:19,22
It will generate new needs

223
0:7:19,22 --> 0:7:21,34
A sudden trade embargo emerges in a region

224
0:7:21,34 --> 0:7:22,74
It will also create new demands

225
0:7:22,74 --> 0:7:23,86
No matter what happens

226
0:7:23,86 --> 0:7:24,92
Human needs remain constant

227
0:7:24,92 --> 0:7:26,58
Because humans need to live every day

228
0:7:26,58 --> 0:7:27,78
Survival is a daily necessity

229
0:7:27,78 --> 0:7:29,64
And survival requires the consumption of resources

230
0:7:29,64 --> 0:7:31,36
Water, electricity, oil, and food

231
0:7:31,36 --> 0:7:32,82
So in many aspects

232
0:7:32,82 --> 0:7:33,74
From our perspective

233
0:7:33,74 --> 0:7:36,84
There are numerous opportunities in life to seize

234
0:7:36,84 --> 0:7:39,84
Never chase after what others excel at

235
0:7:39,84 --> 0:7:41,28
Others have already studied better than you.

236
0:7:41,28 --> 0:7:42,88
Others have already been admitted to Tsinghua or Peking University.

237
0:7:42,88 --> 0:7:44,83
Even if you were to start over several times in this life,

238
0:7:44,83 --> 0:7:45,73
you wouldn't be able to catch up.

239
0:7:45,73 --> 0:7:47,3
So, when it comes to many things,

240
0:7:47,3 --> 0:7:49,7
it's not about how many times you roll for talent,

241
0:7:49,7 --> 0:7:51,9
but rather, no matter what talent you roll for,

242
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:54,64
being able to live a good life in this game is what matters.

243
0:7:54,64 --> 0:7:56,4
So, in many cases,

244
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:56,98
We talk about competing

245
0:7:56,98 --> 0:7:57,8
about outdoing each other

246
0:7:57,8 --> 0:7:59,54
but it really doesn’t make sense

247
0:7:59,54 --> 0:8:2,46
because your gains are different from others’

248
0:8:2,46 --> 0:8:3,5
Let me repeat that

249
0:8:3,5 --> 0:8:4,72
I’m 40 years old now

250
0:8:4,72 --> 0:8:7,34
You will eventually reach 40, even 50

251
0:8:7,34 --> 0:8:7,74
or 60

252
0:8:7,74 --> 0:8:10,299
Your English might never surpass mine.

253
0:8:10,299 --> 0:8:11,959
Even if you study really hard

254
0:8:11,959 --> 0:8:14,65
You can at most match my level.

255
0:8:14,65 --> 0:8:16,47
and I don’t even need English to make money

256
0:8:16,47 --> 0:8:18,53
but you insist on making money through English

257
0:8:18,53 --> 0:8:21,5
that’s the root of your miserable life

258
0:8:21,5 --> 0:8:21,89
I am the rabbit

259
0:8:21,89 --> 0:8:22,73
you are the turtle

260
0:8:22,73 --> 0:8:24,41
you insist on running as fast as the rabbit

261
0:8:24,41 --> 0:8:27,3
I believe with the current advanced technology

262
0:8:27,3 --> 0:8:28,77
You might be able to run as fast as a rabbit

263
0:8:28,77 --> 0:8:30,86
but at what cost?

264
0:8:30,86 --> 0:8:32,36
How much time are you willing to invest?

265
0:8:32,36 --> 0:8:33,66
How much energy are you willing to expend?

266
0:8:33,66 --> 0:8:36,66
So in many aspects of our lives

267
0:8:36,66 --> 0:8:38,2
we believe in hard work

268
0:8:38,2 --> 0:8:39,47
and that diligence can make up for shortcomings

269
0:8:39,47 --> 0:8:42,79
but often we put in effort

270
0:8:42,79 --> 0:8:45,57
where we shouldn’t be exerting ourselves

271
0:8:45,57 --> 0:8:47,819
Struggling in vain to impress yourself

272
0:8:47,819 --> 0:8:50,479
For example, like copying scriptures as a mere formality

273
0:8:50,479 --> 0:8:53,4
If you memorize the content of the scriptures in your heart

274
0:8:53,4 --> 0:8:54,14
Put it into practice

275
0:8:54,14 --> 0:8:55,22
Be a good person

276
0:8:55,22 --> 0:8:56,4
Be a kind person

277
0:8:56,4 --> 0:8:58,73
That might be more useful than copying it a hundred times

278
0:8:58,73 --> 0:9:0,1
In many cases

279
0:9:0,1 --> 0:9:3,21
This copying includes reciting it with others

280
0:9:3,21 --> 0:9:6,1
What we do in front of others is just for show

281
0:9:6,1 --> 0:9:7,37
Often, that's how it is

282
0:9:7,37 --> 0:9:9,23
You work hard to impress others

283
0:9:9,23 --> 0:9:10,46
or to impress yourself?

284
0:9:10,46 --> 0:9:11,98
You try to prove to others

285
0:9:11,98 --> 0:9:13,42
Look, I've copied it 100 times

286
0:9:13,42 --> 0:9:15,0
So I'm a hardworking person

287
0:9:15,0 --> 0:9:16,9
So I'm a highly cultivated person

288
0:9:16,9 --> 0:9:19,46
No, you're just good at copying

289
0:9:19,46 --> 0:9:21,3
If you can truly put it into practice

290
0:9:21,3 --> 0:9:22,3
it makes a difference

291
0:9:22,3 --> 0:9:23,58
it's a different story

292
0:9:23,58 --> 0:9:26,3
The purpose of these things is to help you gain insight

293
0:9:26,3 --> 0:9:29,33
to enable you to effectively manage your emotions

294
0:9:29,33 --> 0:9:31,41
really, how to put it

295
0:9:31,41 --> 0:9:33,7
to act from the heart

296
0:9:33,7 --> 0:9:36,7
so often we say it's not about you

297
0:9:36,7 --> 0:9:38,9
to truly engage in this hands-on activity

298
0:9:38,9 --> 0:9:39,98
And the act of handwriting itself

299
0:9:39,98 --> 0:9:40,5
This kind of thing

300
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:42,2
This behavior can be inspiring

301
0:9:42,2 --> 0:9:44,76
You are merely a tool for transmission

302
0:9:44,76 --> 0:9:47,4
So you must understand your role as a tool

303
0:9:47,4 --> 0:9:49,36
Therefore, we often need to be aware

304
0:9:49,36 --> 0:9:51,68
From an individual's perspective

305
0:9:51,68 --> 0:9:54,98
Society, in general, has expectations of you

306
0:9:54,98 --> 0:9:57,7
But heaven has different expectations for women

307
0:9:57,7 --> 0:9:59,68
We have different standards for ourselves.

308
0:9:59,68 --> 0:10:2,0
Many things that appear to be right on the surface,

309
0:10:2,0 --> 0:10:3,84
things that seem like they should be done,

310
0:10:3,84 --> 0:10:5,32
things that look good,

311
0:10:5,32 --> 0:10:8,329
can actually lead to your downfall.

312
0:10:8,329 --> 0:10:9,809
Why do I say it leads to downfall?

313
0:10:9,809 --> 0:10:11,829
Because wasting time is akin to murdering life.

314
0:10:11,829 --> 0:10:13,169
If you waste a bit more time,

315
0:10:13,169 --> 0:10:14,82
and do something unworthy.

316
0:10:14,82 --> 0:10:17,64
Putting effort into an unworthy relationship

317
0:10:17,64 --> 0:10:18,8
can only move yourself

318
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:20,35
that's why it's called the 'licking dog effect'

319
0:10:20,35 --> 0:10:21,79
So, in many cases

320
0:10:21,79 --> 0:10:24,59
the ultimate outcome is to satisfy oneself

321
0:10:24,59 --> 0:10:25,43
to move oneself

322
0:10:25,43 --> 0:10:27,15
to the point of shedding tears

323
0:10:27,15 --> 0:10:28,3
like a damn fool

324
0:10:28,3 --> 0:10:28,9
and then

325
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:30,44
You've spent your entire life.

326
0:10:30,44 --> 0:10:31,34
When you grow old,

327
0:10:31,34 --> 0:10:33,42
you won't be as significant to society anymore.

328
0:10:33,42 --> 0:10:34,9
You won't have as much influence.

329
0:10:34,9 --> 0:10:36,46
You won't make as big a splash.

330
0:10:36,46 --> 0:10:38,34
So it's easiest to comfort you now.

331
0:10:38,34 --> 0:10:39,79
We can even enroll you in a senior university.

332
0:10:39,79 --> 0:10:40,81
So you need to understand,

333
0:10:40,81 --> 0:10:42,59
you have to accept the advice society gives you.

334
0:10:42,59 --> 0:10:45,85
It's also important to understand that society's expectations of us are actually quite low.

335
0:10:45,85 --> 0:10:47,35
As ordinary people,

336
0:10:47,35 --> 0:10:49,51
Or, speaking of being an NPC,

337
0:10:49,51 --> 0:10:51,19
unless you stand out in some significant way,

338
0:10:51,19 --> 0:10:54,17
society’s expectations of you are actually rather low.

339
0:10:54,17 --> 0:10:56,5
Just don’t break the law,

340
0:10:56,5 --> 0:10:57,819
and pay your taxes, and that’s enough.

341
0:10:57,819 --> 0:10:58,999
Most of the time,

342
0:10:58,999 --> 0:11:1,19
what you want to do in your daily life is up to you.

343
0:11:1,19 --> 0:11:1,579
What do you feel like eating?

344
0:11:1,579 --> 0:11:2,419
What do you feel like playing?

345
0:11:2,419 --> 0:11:4,299
In fact, most people don't give much advice.

346
0:11:4,299 --> 0:11:6,1
They don't have many demands.

347
0:11:6,1 --> 0:11:8,49
Unless society assigns you a special role.

348
0:11:8,49 --> 0:11:10,65
Otherwise, you might have a bit of a moral flaw.

349
0:11:10,65 --> 0:11:11,8
But you don't really care.

350
0:11:11,8 --> 0:11:13,0
In many cases,

351
0:11:13,0 --> 0:11:14,8
it's the opposite of what we were taught as children.

352
0:11:14,8 --> 0:11:17,44
Because the essence of education is to soothe

353
0:11:17,44 --> 0:11:20,86
The essence of education is to make most people feel that their lives

354
0:11:20,86 --> 0:11:23,6
The essence of education is to help most people find themselves

355
0:11:23,6 --> 0:11:24,48
in a suitable position

356
0:11:24,48 --> 0:11:26,16
aligned with societal expectations

357
0:11:26,16 --> 0:11:27,96
But how do we talk about human society?

358
0:11:27,96 --> 0:11:29,1
after so many years of development

359
0:11:29,1 --> 0:11:30,76
It's not about societal expectations for you

360
0:11:30,76 --> 0:11:32,99
being the happiest moments of your life

361
0:11:32,99 --> 0:11:34,47
What does society expect from you?

362
0:11:34,47 --> 0:11:36,83
To exhaust all your capabilities when you're young

363
0:11:36,83 --> 0:11:37,49
Work hard

364
0:11:37,49 --> 0:11:39,7
Create plenty of value

365
0:11:39,7 --> 0:11:40,18
Ideally, have children

366
0:11:40,18 --> 0:11:40,82
And then

367
0:11:40,82 --> 0:11:44,18
Spend every penny you've earned on yourself

368
0:11:44,18 --> 0:11:46,0
And become part of the economic cycle

369
0:11:46,0 --> 0:11:47,32
Don't save a dime when you're old

370
0:11:47,32 --> 0:11:48,4
Try to die as early as possible

371
0:11:48,4 --> 0:11:49,77
Don't bother collecting a pension

372
0:11:49,77 --> 0:11:51,89
This is what society truly needs from you

373
0:11:51,89 --> 0:11:54,7
But would society ever say these things out loud?

374
0:11:54,7 --> 0:11:54,92
No, it wouldn't

375
0:11:54,92 --> 0:11:56,72
But in the choices you make in life

376
0:11:56,72 --> 0:11:57,76
In many aspects

377
0:11:57,76 --> 0:11:58,68
You can resist

378
0:11:58,68 --> 0:11:59,7
You can balance the scales

379
0:11:59,7 --> 0:12:1,21
You can engage in strategic games.

380
0:12:1,21 --> 0:12:3,13
But when it comes to a smart person,

381
0:12:3,13 --> 0:12:4,47
they would make such plans early on.

382
0:12:4,47 --> 0:12:6,3
On the surface, they appear compliant,

383
0:12:6,3 --> 0:12:8,5
but in reality, they have their own ideas.

384
0:12:8,5 --> 0:12:10,62
That’s what a smart person looks like in modern society,

385
0:12:10,62 --> 0:12:13,6
not just following the conventional paths of society.

386
0:12:13,6 --> 0:12:16,4
Remember, society often encourages these paths,

387
0:12:16,4 --> 0:12:16,72
these morals.

388
0:12:16,72 --> 0:12:17,88
These roads

389
0:12:17,88 --> 0:12:19,52
all these things

390
0:12:19,52 --> 0:12:22,56
these confusing elements are meant to frame the majority of people

391
0:12:22,56 --> 0:12:24,54
to keep the majority of people stable

392
0:12:24,54 --> 0:12:26,4
this is also a fundamental need of society

393
0:12:26,4 --> 0:12:28,2
if everyone were like you

394
0:12:28,2 --> 0:12:29,38
with a restless heart every day

395
0:12:29,38 --> 0:12:30,64
always thinking about changing their fate

396
0:12:30,64 --> 0:12:32,5
society would also become unstable

397
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:35,1
So when you have the determination to change your destiny

398
0:12:35,1 --> 0:12:36,2
When you have

399
0:12:36,2 --> 0:12:38,38
the unconventional idea of social mobility

400
0:12:38,38 --> 0:12:39,16
you need to understand

401
0:12:39,16 --> 0:12:42,16
that you have to do unconventional things to achieve unconventional goals

402
0:12:42,16 --> 0:12:43,76
So often we say

403
0:12:43,76 --> 0:12:46,8
we can't just think about how our lives are now

404
0:12:46,8 --> 0:12:48,84
we need to think about the kind of life we want in the future

405
0:12:48,84 --> 0:12:50,79
we can't use the same logic we use now

406
0:12:50,79 --> 0:12:53,73
Because this logic is designed to pacify the majority.

407
0:12:55,349 --> 0:12:56,649
To endure and submit.

408
0:12:56,649 --> 0:12:57,129
Right?

409
0:12:57,129 --> 0:12:58,889
Many things that we take for granted aren't actually as they seem on the surface.

410
0:12:58,889 --> 0:13:1,34
They aren't what we superficially believe them to be.

411
0:13:1,34 --> 0:13:3,78
So you need to absorb new perspectives.

412
0:13:3,78 --> 0:13:6,14
To understand how these perspectives truly work.

413
0:13:6,14 --> 0:13:8,2
To grasp the rules that govern society.

414
0:13:8,2 --> 0:13:11,44
Ultimately, this leads to personal liberation.

415
0:13:11,44 --> 0:13:13,64
Liberation for the masses is unrealistic

416
0:13:13,64 --> 0:13:15,27
It's more of a slogan

417
0:13:15,27 --> 0:13:17,71
Often, it's about individuals finding redemption

418
0:13:17,71 --> 0:13:19,39
An individual achieving a leap forward

419
0:13:19,39 --> 0:13:20,91
An individual attaining true freedom

420
0:13:20,91 --> 0:13:24,11
An individual gaining complete freedom is achievable

421
0:13:24,11 --> 0:13:27,25
So this is what we strive for in sociology

422
0:13:27,25 --> 0:13:28,51
The meaning of a perfect life

423
0:13:28,51 --> 0:13:31,2
That is, you were supposed to follow a tortoise's path

424
0:13:31,2 --> 0:13:33,66
But you took the path of, say, the phoenix.

425
0:13:33,66 --> 0:13:36,42
But you must have the resilience to forge ahead.

426
0:13:36,42 --> 0:13:39,28
Speaking of turtles, there are also alligator snapping turtles.

427
0:13:39,28 --> 0:13:40,2
And sea turtles.

428
0:13:40,2 --> 0:13:41,21
And various other types of turtles.

429
0:13:41,21 --> 0:13:42,89
What kind of turtle could you become?

430
0:13:42,89 --> 0:13:44,69
Could you become a thousand-year-old turtle?

431
0:13:44,69 --> 0:13:46,55
This would be your best possible outcome.

432
0:13:46,55 --> 0:13:48,839
After all, people should know their own limits.

433
0:13:48,839 --> 0:13:50,59
It's better not to use it.

434
0:13:50,59 --> 0:13:51,359
This tricycle chasing vehicles

435
0:13:51,359 --> 0:13:55,439
Don't compare your E-class skills with others' S-class skills.

436
0:13:55,439 --> 0:13:56,69
It's meaningless.

437
0:13:56,69 --> 0:13:58,97
Others can survive with just a bit of effort.

438
0:13:58,97 --> 0:14:0,21
A slight advantage at 20 points.

439
0:14:0,21 --> 0:14:2,74
But you, with the same effort, can only achieve a two-point effect.

440
0:14:2,74 --> 0:14:4,74
That's just a waste of time.

441
0:14:4,74 --> 0:14:6,16
In terms of efficiency,

442
0:14:6,16 --> 0:14:8,6
Use a hammer to drive in nails

443
0:14:8,6 --> 0:14:10,82
Use this pickaxe to mine the ore

444
0:14:10,82 --> 0:14:12,66
It's also a pretty efficient way to do things

445
0:14:12,66 --> 0:14:14,8
So in this new era

446
0:14:14,8 --> 0:14:17,76
You need to first understand what kind of tool you are

447
0:14:17,76 --> 0:14:19,48
First and foremost, you are a tool

448
0:14:19,48 --> 0:14:21,43
You have your place in society

449
0:14:21,43 --> 0:14:22,55
So to speak

450
0:14:22,55 --> 0:14:24,63
You need to remove the premise of being a tool

451
0:14:24,63 --> 0:14:28,19
It's important to understand the essence of why one becomes a tool for others.

452
0:14:28,19 --> 0:14:29,55
And you need to realize

453
0:14:29,55 --> 0:14:32,15
Society actually doesn't expect much from you

454
0:14:32,15 --> 0:14:33,71
You can transform into a role in society

455
0:14:33,71 --> 0:14:35,79
That meets the expectations of others

456
0:14:35,79 --> 0:14:37,91
So our careers and our states of being

457
0:14:37,91 --> 0:14:39,67
Are all free to change

458
0:14:39,67 --> 0:14:41,599
They're not as fixed as others might say

459
0:14:41,599 --> 0:14:44,299
But whether you can take on another role is another story

460
0:14:44,299 --> 0:14:45,539
It depends on you

461
0:14:45,539 --> 0:14:48,299
rather than the advice from other members of society

462
0:14:48,299 --> 0:14:49,46
or their recognition of you

463
0:14:49,46 --> 0:14:52,48
So, when we talk about this, we come to our second core point

464
0:14:52,48 --> 0:14:55,89
If you want to accept the roles others assign to you

465
0:14:55,89 --> 0:14:58,33
the most important thing is to learn how to perform

466
0:14:58,33 --> 0:15:0,53
That is, your identity outside is given by yourself

467
0:15:0,53 --> 0:15:1,77
Many times

468
0:15:1,77 --> 0:15:3,7
it's about how you present yourself

469
0:15:3,7 --> 0:15:3,85
More often than not

470
0:15:3,85 --> 0:15:6,25
life is more about performance skills

471
0:15:6,25 --> 0:15:9,29
Performance doesn't just mean going on stage

472
0:15:9,29 --> 0:15:10,77
or performing for others in a simple way

473
0:15:10,77 --> 0:15:13,96
Performance is the ability to get others to accept you in a short time

474
0:15:13,96 --> 0:15:16,88
as a certain role

475
0:15:16,88 --> 0:15:19,28
That is, in a short time, others judge who you are through your attire

476
0:15:19,28 --> 0:15:20,75
and your behavior

477
0:15:20,75 --> 0:15:22,15
They perceive what kind of person you are

478
0:15:22,15 --> 0:15:24,11
And sometimes, this projection

479
0:15:24,11 --> 0:15:26,59
whether it's an admiring projection or a fearful one

480
0:15:26,59 --> 0:15:27,63
is necessary

481
0:15:27,63 --> 0:15:29,53
That is, at critical moments

482
0:15:29,53 --> 0:15:32,49
some people's jobs require them to be various kinds of people

483
0:15:32,49 --> 0:15:35,899
For example, if you're serving your country

484
0:15:35,899 --> 0:15:37,99
Many times

485
0:15:37,99 --> 0:15:40,8
you need to be all sorts of people

486
0:15:40,8 --> 0:15:41,52
You might be in one state at one moment

487
0:15:41,52 --> 0:15:42,76
and another state the next

488
0:15:42,76 --> 0:15:43,8
Just like Yu Zecheng

489
0:15:43,8 --> 0:15:46,36
So, many times, you need to be versatile

490
0:15:46,36 --> 0:15:48,0
This is also why acting is important

491
0:15:48,0 --> 0:15:49,22
Similarly

492
0:15:51,46 --> 0:15:52,9
many times, you need to have acting skills

493
0:15:52,9 --> 0:15:55,17
You need to have the ability to say one thing and do another

494
0:15:55,17 --> 0:15:57,37
Because true Machiavellians are like this

495
0:15:57,37 --> 0:15:58,77
They deeply understand the principles of governance

496
0:15:58,77 --> 0:16:2,21
They deeply understand the true, dark principles of society

497
0:16:2,21 --> 0:16:5,13
Society has its own way of operating

498
0:16:5,13 --> 0:16:6,93
But it also has a set of grand narratives

499
0:16:6,93 --> 0:16:9,29
But you need to know what the underlying rules are

500
0:16:9,29 --> 0:16:11,99
Only then can you live more confidently

501
0:16:11,99 --> 0:16:12,91
more confidently

502
0:16:12,91 --> 0:16:14,47
more freely

503
0:16:14,47 --> 0:16:15,81
This is a prerequisite

504
0:16:15,81 --> 0:16:18,4
That is, as you grow up

505
0:16:18,4 --> 0:16:20,4
you need to see through these children's stories

506
0:16:20,4 --> 0:16:22,88
the fables like the Tortoise and the Hare

507
0:16:22,88 --> 0:16:24,54
what they want you to do

508
0:16:24,54 --> 0:16:28,1
They want you to be a tortoise that works hard and steadily

509
0:16:28,1 --> 0:16:29,46
But do you want to be a tortoise?

510
0:16:29,46 --> 0:16:30,8
You don't

511
0:16:30,8 --> 0:16:32,12
Otherwise, you'd be a 'tortoise man', right?
