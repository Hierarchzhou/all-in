1
0:0:0,26 --> 0:0:2,27
I live on the eighth floor.

2
0:0:2,27 --> 0:0:4,91
The neighbor in the apartment building often beats their child.

3
0:0:4,91 --> 0:0:5,83
They argue with the child.

4
0:0:5,83 --> 0:0:7,21
Later, the child became a bit stressed out.

5
0:0:7,21 --> 0:0:8,79
He yells at his parents every day.

6
0:0:8,79 --> 0:0:10,61
It’s really quite terrifying.

7
0:0:10,61 --> 0:0:13,649
First of all, the male owner of the household has some issues.

8
0:0:13,649 --> 0:0:17,129
He often speaks in a mournful voice to the old sign.

9
0:0:17,129 --> 0:0:19,689
This has led to his wife yelling as well.

10
0:0:19,689 --> 0:0:20,369
My son also yells

11
0:0:20,369 --> 0:0:21,649
He yells himself too

12
0:0:21,649 --> 0:0:22,8
It's really terrifying

13
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:25,28
And recently, it's gotten even more unbearable

14
0:0:25,28 --> 0:0:26,8
The tenth floor is under renovation

15
0:0:26,8 --> 0:0:29,1
When they do the renovation

16
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:30,88
Sometimes on Saturdays and Sundays, they work a bit

17
0:0:30,88 --> 0:0:34,42
During the usual nap time from ten to two in the afternoon

18
0:0:34,42 --> 0:0:37,399
They don't always stick to the schedule

19
0:0:37,399 --> 0:0:39,299
This really gets me annoyed.

20
0:0:39,299 --> 0:0:43,6
Then I shared this with some of my friends.

21
0:0:43,6 --> 0:0:44,1
Some said, 'Oh!',

22
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:45,66
You should call the police.

23
0:0:45,66 --> 0:0:48,73
His first reaction was that you should report it to the police.

24
0:0:48,73 --> 0:0:49,91
Someone suggested you could move out.

25
0:0:49,91 --> 0:0:51,959
Others said you could confront them directly.

26
0:0:51,959 --> 0:0:56,959
All these suggestions are telling you how to resolve the current conflict.

27
0:0:56,959 --> 0:1:1,75
But the difference between people lies in their mindset.

28
0:1:1,75 --> 0:1:4,74
The way of thinking about problems is different.

29
0:1:4,74 --> 0:1:7,94
We often say that many people are poor because they are poor.

30
0:1:7,94 --> 0:1:9,14
It's not because of laziness,

31
0:1:9,14 --> 0:1:12,9
but because there's a problem with their way of thinking.

32
0:1:12,9 --> 0:1:15,369
The thinking patterns of the rich and the poor have fundamental differences.

33
0:1:15,369 --> 0:1:18,129
So, how should you approach thinking about this issue?

34
0:1:18,129 --> 0:1:20,96
Actually, this is a good thing.

35
0:1:20,96 --> 0:1:24,7
Right now, my main task is to stay at home and sleep.

36
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:26,1
And then to make videos.

37
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:29,9
The most important thing when it comes to shooting videos is to go out and shoot.

38
0:1:29,9 --> 0:1:31,759
Going out to shoot is what makes it a VLOG.

39
0:1:31,759 --> 0:1:35,859
This actually encourages me to get more exercise during the day.

40
0:1:35,859 --> 0:1:39,2
Everyone knows that getting out and exercising is beneficial for me.

41
0:1:39,2 --> 0:1:40,52
Whether it's going out to shoot videos,

42
0:1:40,52 --> 0:1:41,64
it's good for my career,

43
0:1:41,64 --> 0:1:43,12
or going out to exercise,

44
0:1:43,12 --> 0:1:44,64
it's good for my health,

45
0:1:44,64 --> 0:1:46,82
getting out there is always better than staying at home.

46
0:1:46,82 --> 0:1:52,23
So, when people argue or the upstairs neighbors are renovating,

47
0:1:52,23 --> 0:1:54,29
these are ways that nature is waking you up,

48
0:1:54,29 --> 0:1:56,6
encouraging you to step out.

49
0:1:56,6 --> 0:1:58,68
Speaking of crisis,

50
0:1:58,68 --> 0:2:0,0
in times of danger,

51
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:1,71
there are often opportunities as well.

52
0:2:1,71 --> 0:2:4,83
Typically, danger and opportunity coexist.

53
0:2:4,83 --> 0:2:8,0
Just like the Chu-Han Contention between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu,

54
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:10,32
many times, the more there is an opportunity.

55
0:2:10,32 --> 0:2:11,48
The more there are opportunities for action,

56
0:2:11,48 --> 0:2:12,92
the more fleeting those chances are,

57
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:15,0
you must seize them to turn your life around.

58
0:2:15,0 --> 0:2:16,56
So we say that for the poor to improve their situation,

59
0:2:16,56 --> 0:2:18,2
the most crucial thing is to seize opportunities.

60
0:2:18,2 --> 0:2:19,45
You have to be willing to take risks.

61
0:2:19,45 --> 0:2:22,13
But what does school education teach you?

62
0:2:22,13 --> 0:2:23,97
School education teaches you to follow the rules.

63
0:2:23,97 --> 0:2:26,559
But we do say that you should abide by the law.

64
0:2:26,559 --> 0:2:27,719
The laws of the country must be followed.

65
0:2:27,719 --> 0:2:29,319
We must respect the authority of the law.

66
0:2:29,319 --> 0:2:32,58
It’s important to understand that the law treats everyone equally.

67
0:2:32,58 --> 0:2:35,18
Moreover, the penalties for breaking the law are very severe.

68
0:2:35,18 --> 0:2:37,19
You will have to pay a significant social price.

69
0:2:37,19 --> 0:2:40,39
However, you should also understand many unwritten rules between people.

70
0:2:40,39 --> 0:2:41,67
There are some you don’t need to follow.

71
0:2:41,67 --> 0:2:44,269
The poorer you are, the less you should adhere to these rules.

72
0:2:44,269 --> 0:2:45,869
There are certain rules that shouldn’t be followed.

73
0:2:45,869 --> 0:2:46,749
Don't be too concerned about face

74
0:2:46,749 --> 0:2:47,669
Don't stick to the rules too rigidly

75
0:2:47,669 --> 0:2:49,989
Don't always worry about what others think

76
0:2:49,989 --> 0:2:51,749
Today, I had a discussion with another UPloader

77
0:2:51,749 --> 0:2:54,8
Just because of this, we ended up arguing

78
0:2:54,8 --> 0:2:57,1
He's had a particularly tough fate

79
0:2:57,1 --> 0:2:58,48
He's been extremely unlucky

80
0:2:58,48 --> 0:3:0,38
From a young age, he's endured a lot of hardship

81
0:3:0,38 --> 0:3:2,78
So our life experiences are completely different

82
0:3:2,78 --> 0:3:5,9
I had a fairly happy childhood.

83
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:7,62
But that's my own conclusion.

84
0:3:7,62 --> 0:3:9,82
Now when I look back on my childhood,

85
0:3:9,82 --> 0:3:11,1
I feel that it was quite happy.

86
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:13,91
But like any child, I had my share of troubles.

87
0:3:13,91 --> 0:3:15,79
Like being bullied by teachers or something like that.

88
0:3:15,79 --> 0:3:18,7
Or being bullied by classmates and other such things.

89
0:3:18,7 --> 0:3:18,99
These memories come back.

90
0:3:18,99 --> 0:3:19,79
But when you reflect on them,

91
0:3:19,79 --> 0:3:20,39
You'll find

92
0:3:20,39 --> 0:3:22,75
that sometimes other classmates might think differently from you

93
0:3:22,75 --> 0:3:25,59
Oh, other classmates might recall being bullied by you

94
0:3:25,59 --> 0:3:26,95
So it's completely different

95
0:3:26,95 --> 0:3:28,94
So when people reminisce

96
0:3:28,94 --> 0:3:30,14
they tend to romanticize certain aspects

97
0:3:30,14 --> 0:3:31,28
and overlook others

98
0:3:31,28 --> 0:3:32,94
the parts where they were the perpetrator

99
0:3:32,94 --> 0:3:34,12
Actually, this is quite interesting

100
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:35,589
Humans have selective memory.

101
0:3:35,589 --> 0:3:40,149
But the main issue we're discussing today is that you shouldn't be afraid of what others think of you.

102
0:3:40,149 --> 0:3:41,189
Or what they say about you.

103
0:3:41,189 --> 0:3:43,87
And most of the rules in society.

104
0:3:43,87 --> 0:3:46,99
I often post more than five statuses a day on my social media.

105
0:3:46,99 --> 0:3:50,53
A friend of mine said that anyone who posts more than five statuses a day must be crazy.

106
0:3:50,53 --> 0:3:52,68
I said, 'I am indeed crazy.'

107
0:3:53,92 --> 0:3:54,94
And anxious.

108
0:3:54,94 --> 0:3:56,16
And also obsessive.

109
0:3:56,16 --> 0:3:58,1
These all fall under the category of control issues.

110
0:3:58,1 --> 0:3:59,76
It's about the intensity of control.

111
0:3:59,76 --> 0:4:0,94
What is anxiety?

112
0:4:0,94 --> 0:4:3,1
I worry about things far into the future.

113
0:4:3,1 --> 0:4:4,28
What is panic?

114
0:4:4,28 --> 0:4:8,17
I panic about whether I might have an accident right now.

115
0:4:8,17 --> 0:4:9,21
Don't go away.

116
0:4:9,21 --> 0:4:9,97
Don't joke with me.

117
0:4:9,97 --> 0:4:11,65
That's why I can't control myself in the elevator.

118
0:4:11,65 --> 0:4:14,66
Actually, it has a lot to do with panic attacks.

119
0:4:14,66 --> 0:4:16,9
And then there are compulsive behaviors.

120
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:19,8
Like buying things in pairs.

121
0:4:19,8 --> 0:4:21,31
If I like something, I tend to collect the whole set.

122
0:4:21,31 --> 0:4:24,35
So when it comes to consumerism, this is an issue.

123
0:4:24,35 --> 0:4:26,65
I actually try to resist this tendency.

124
0:4:26,65 --> 0:4:29,3
I am prone to buying more than I need.

125
0:4:29,3 --> 0:4:30,59
So, when it comes to anything,

126
0:4:30,59 --> 0:4:31,63
it's all related.

127
0:4:31,63 --> 0:4:33,55
How to talk about the coexistence of V and the machine

128
0:4:33,55 --> 0:4:36,46
So we can't emphasize one part

129
0:4:36,46 --> 0:4:37,98
while neglecting the other

130
0:4:37,98 --> 0:4:38,98
In many cases

131
0:4:38,98 --> 0:4:42,62
the fleeting opportunities you have

132
0:4:42,62 --> 0:4:44,489
most of the time

133
0:4:44,489 --> 0:4:46,229
it's about taking risks at critical moments

134
0:4:46,229 --> 0:4:48,629
so to be able to take risks at critical moments

135
0:4:48,629 --> 0:4:51,9
you can't afford to be in debt at those critical times

136
0:4:51,9 --> 0:4:53,39
There must be a way out.

137
0:4:53,39 --> 0:4:55,39
The timing for a decisive move.

138
0:4:55,39 --> 0:4:57,23
We lack the conditions for a decisive move.

139
0:4:57,23 --> 0:4:59,8
So we need to create those conditions.

140
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:2,18
In fact, most of our lives are spent waiting.

141
0:5:2,18 --> 0:5:3,65
There are only a couple of days.

142
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:5,21
Only a few opportunities.

143
0:5:5,21 --> 0:5:6,61
We need to go all out.

144
0:5:6,61 --> 0:5:7,89
How should I put it?

145
0:5:7,89 --> 0:5:10,659
Like an arrow released from a bow, aim straight for the bullseye.

146
0:5:10,659 --> 0:5:15,279
So I often say that opportunities to change one's fate come six times a day.

147
0:5:15,279 --> 0:5:16,95
But there's a catch.

148
0:5:16,95 --> 0:5:19,47
I mean, the truly significant opportunities to change one's life

149
0:5:19,47 --> 0:5:20,63
probably only come three times in a lifetime.

150
0:5:20,63 --> 0:5:22,91
Similarly, the chances to become wealthy also come about three times in a lifetime.

151
0:5:22,91 --> 0:5:24,64
If you can nail all three jumps,

152
0:5:24,64 --> 0:5:25,36
you'll be amazing.

153
0:5:25,36 --> 0:5:26,56
So, speaking of recent developments,

154
0:5:26,56 --> 0:5:29,21
I feel that my Bilibili content is getting increasingly challenging to produce.

155
0:5:29,21 --> 0:5:30,49
But while it’s challenging,

156
0:5:30,49 --> 0:5:33,64
I realize that everything is a matter of trade-offs.

157
0:5:33,64 --> 0:5:36,8
Perhaps one day my Bilibili content won’t be as good,

158
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:37,4
but I’ve managed to build up my YouTube channel.

159
0:5:37,4 --> 0:5:40,28
Maybe I’m not putting as much effort into social media,

160
0:5:40,28 --> 0:5:40,6
but

161
0:5:40,6 --> 0:5:42,26
perhaps other ventures are taking off.

162
0:5:42,26 --> 0:5:44,24
Because right now, I actually have a lot of ideas in my head.

163
0:5:44,24 --> 0:5:45,9
If I were to start from now

164
0:5:45,9 --> 0:5:47,22
and stop making videos in the future

165
0:5:47,22 --> 0:5:48,22
what should I do?

166
0:5:48,22 --> 0:5:50,18
After careful consideration this time

167
0:5:50,18 --> 0:5:53,15
I think I should continue with my consulting work

168
0:5:53,15 --> 0:5:56,83
especially given the current market environment in China

169
0:5:56,83 --> 0:5:59,66
we talk about so many in the world

170
0:5:59,66 --> 0:6:1,16
who desperately need to be saved

171
0:6:1,16 --> 0:6:4,42
who desperately need to hear the right advice

172
0:6:4,42 --> 0:6:8,8
That is, this kind of mental abuse in China

173
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:10,42
the longer this environment persists

174
0:6:10,42 --> 0:6:13,4
the more mentally unstable individuals it creates

175
0:6:13,4 --> 0:6:15,26
the more mentally unstable people it produces

176
0:6:15,26 --> 0:6:16,2
In many cases

177
0:6:16,2 --> 0:6:20,7
I feel that when it comes to mental treatment, how should I put it

178
0:6:20,7 --> 0:6:22,38
the normal ones rely on medication

179
0:6:22,38 --> 0:6:23,6
on their own strength

180
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:24,68
there's a huge gap in between

181
0:6:24,68 --> 0:6:26,96
What we call a support group

182
0:6:26,96 --> 0:6:28,52
A support group is really important

183
0:6:28,52 --> 0:6:29,75
A support group

184
0:6:29,75 --> 0:6:32,3
A support group is crucial when you have stomach issues

185
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:35,37
It's a vital component in preventing mental health disorders

186
0:6:35,37 --> 0:6:40,2
I suddenly feel that this area will see growth in the future

187
0:6:40,2 --> 0:6:41,0
Right here

188
0:6:41,0 --> 0:6:46,78
On one hand, there's a need for regular mental health prevention, treatment, and medication

189
0:6:46,78 --> 0:6:47,68
The regular

190
0:6:47,68 --> 0:6:50,32
Now, the functions of hospitals are mainly focused on maintaining these conditions.

191
0:6:50,32 --> 0:6:54,31
However, many people are actually unaware that they suffer from mental illnesses.

192
0:6:54,31 --> 0:6:55,47
Or, to put it another way,

193
0:6:55,47 --> 0:6:58,29
they need guidance on how to move forward in life.

194
0:6:58,29 --> 0:7:0,96
For example, they need guidance on their path forward,

195
0:7:0,96 --> 0:7:2,7
such as career choices,

196
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:5,36
and often in their marital life as well,

197
0:7:5,36 --> 0:7:7,6
parents may not always be a reliable source of support,

198
0:7:7,6 --> 0:7:9,58
this source that sustains them.

199
0:7:9,58 --> 0:7:10,58
You wouldn't turn to your wife

200
0:7:10,58 --> 0:7:12,62
or your husband for help either

201
0:7:12,62 --> 0:7:16,0
So, in society, people are often left to fend for themselves

202
0:7:16,0 --> 0:7:18,64
That's why people like us exist

203
0:7:18,64 --> 0:7:20,92
The existence of people like us

204
0:7:20,92 --> 0:7:22,75
fills a gap in society

205
0:7:22,75 --> 0:7:24,79
So today, we need to consider this issue

206
0:7:24,79 --> 0:7:26,91
Whenever there's a void in anything

207
0:7:26,91 --> 0:7:29,21
there will be a force that fills it

208
0:7:29,21 --> 0:7:32,47
Everything that appears to be dangerous in society

209
0:7:32,47 --> 0:7:34,36
or seems unreasonable

210
0:7:34,36 --> 0:7:36,8
is actually a new point of economic growth

211
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:38,96
or a new business model that can fill a gap

212
0:7:38,96 --> 0:7:41,28
or anything that looks dangerous

213
0:7:41,28 --> 0:7:42,72
is actually an opportunity to make money

214
0:7:42,72 --> 0:7:43,74
it's all about this

215
0:7:43,74 --> 0:7:44,98
so many times

216
0:7:44,98 --> 0:7:47,18
we see a societal need starting to emerge here

217
0:7:47,18 --> 0:7:48,3
It develops a wound

218
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:49,38
It starts to bleed

219
0:7:49,38 --> 0:7:51,1
From a personal perspective

220
0:7:51,1 --> 0:7:52,18
This is a pain that lingers throughout one's life

221
0:7:52,18 --> 0:7:53,58
But from a societal perspective

222
0:7:53,58 --> 0:7:56,65
This becomes a significant factor that slows down social efficiency

223
0:7:56,65 --> 0:7:57,33
A flaw

224
0:7:57,33 --> 0:7:58,21
So to speak

225
0:7:58,21 --> 0:8:0,37
Someone creates a hole in society

226
0:8:0,37 --> 0:8:2,9
Someone has to fix this hole.

227
0:8:2,9 --> 0:8:6,45
So this is what I think about my future, in case I decide to stop doing this one day.

228
0:8:6,45 --> 0:8:9,4
If it comes to self-media, there might be an impulse and plan to do so.

229
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:10,52
But overall,

230
0:8:10,52 --> 0:8:11,52
society has this demand.

231
0:8:11,52 --> 0:8:14,45
If not you, Zhang San, then Li Si will do it.

232
0:8:14,45 --> 0:8:18,69
It's precisely because Chinese parents create so many black holes in the spiritual realm,

233
0:8:18,69 --> 0:8:20,91
that there will be people to fill these black holes.

234
0:8:20,91 --> 0:8:23,35
That's why there are people teaching you how to avoid pitfalls.

235
0:8:23,35 --> 0:8:25,59
So you see, my books are really selling quite well.

236
0:8:25,59 --> 0:8:28,92
I've also drawn two more to give away during the lottery.

237
0:8:28,92 --> 0:8:30,74
This is specifically for the raffle.

238
0:8:30,74 --> 0:8:33,48
And if this has helped you in any way,

239
0:8:33,48 --> 0:8:37,54
please leave more positive reviews on our store page.

240
0:8:37,54 --> 0:8:38,78
It’s great to have more comments.

241
0:8:38,78 --> 0:8:41,26
Well, no matter how you look at it,

242
0:8:41,26 --> 0:8:45,9
instead of always trying to avoid difficulties,

243
0:8:45,9 --> 0:8:47,34
trying to avoid the breaking points

244
0:8:47,34 --> 0:8:49,8
If you want to avoid these disasters in life,

245
0:8:49,8 --> 0:8:51,25
the truth is, you can't really avoid them.

246
0:8:51,25 --> 0:8:54,59
More often, it's about taking an active approach to face them,

247
0:8:54,59 --> 0:8:55,57
actively managing them,

248
0:8:55,57 --> 0:8:56,71
risk management,

249
0:8:56,71 --> 0:8:58,97
and even embracing a spirit of adventure.

250
0:8:58,97 --> 0:9:1,13
In other words, life is a mix of good and bad times,

251
0:9:1,13 --> 0:9:3,19
it's actually a simple logic.

252
0:9:3,19 --> 0:9:7,87
But this logic often tells us why ordinary people shouldn't take risks.

253
0:9:7,87 --> 0:9:9,7
Don't take the risk of starting a business

254
0:9:9,7 --> 0:9:9,79
Don't take the risk

255
0:9:9,79 --> 0:9:10,51
Go for the risk

256
0:9:10,51 --> 0:9:13,36
This is because people can't manage their own risks

257
0:9:13,36 --> 0:9:14,46
For many people

258
0:9:14,46 --> 0:9:16,12
Especially those who are suppressed at the bottom

259
0:9:16,12 --> 0:9:18,41
Many people are very afraid of taking risks

260
0:9:18,41 --> 0:9:21,45
But their economic behavior is contradictory

261
0:9:21,45 --> 0:9:23,67
They themselves are afraid of taking risks

262
0:9:23,67 --> 0:9:26,12
But they buy things on installment plans.

263
0:9:26,12 --> 0:9:27,8
They are afraid of taking risks themselves.

264
0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:29,36
Yet they take out high-interest loans.

265
0:9:29,36 --> 0:9:30,64
They are afraid of taking risks themselves.

266
0:9:30,64 --> 0:9:32,2
Yet they use services like Meituan Monthly Payment.

267
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:37,1
Things like JD White Card, these hidden high-interest loans are extremely serious.

268
0:9:37,1 --> 0:9:38,25
For many people,

269
0:9:38,25 --> 0:9:40,89
Huabei means owing tens of thousands of yuan every day.

270
0:9:40,89 --> 0:9:41,85
It's often the case.

271
0:9:41,85 --> 0:9:42,25
Well, how to put it?

272
0:9:42,25 --> 0:9:44,799
His family won't cover his expenses either.

273
0:9:44,799 --> 0:9:45,799
That would be just a drop in the bucket.

274
0:9:45,799 --> 0:9:48,579
So over time, these financial derivatives,

275
0:9:48,579 --> 0:9:49,819
these financial products,

276
0:9:49,819 --> 0:9:51,44
the so-called financial reforms,

277
0:9:52,98 --> 0:9:55,44
are essentially just high-interest loans from ancient times,

278
0:9:55,44 --> 0:9:57,98
which used to prey on tenants with compounding interest,

279
0:9:57,98 --> 0:9:59,24
now they prey on office workers.

280
0:9:59,24 --> 0:10:0,48
It's just that simple.

281
0:10:0,48 --> 0:10:2,41
So it's not some groundbreaking innovation.

282
0:10:2,41 --> 0:10:7,61
Who gives these financial products their value? It's the wealthy who pay for them.

283
0:10:7,61 --> 0:10:8,6
Right.

284
0:10:8,6 --> 0:10:9,88
Who pockets this profit?

285
0:10:9,88 --> 0:10:13,94
Well, it's those big shots in finance who create these products.

286
0:10:13,94 --> 0:10:15,73
They're making money off ordinary people.

287
0:10:15,73 --> 0:10:17,45
So it's just a simple concept.

288
0:10:17,45 --> 0:10:19,25
Why am I telling you this?

289
0:10:19,25 --> 0:10:20,49
That's because there are many things

290
0:10:20,49 --> 0:10:23,41
that he doesn't hear in the school system or in your family

291
0:10:23,41 --> 0:10:24,89
which is why it's called avoiding pitfalls

292
0:10:24,89 --> 0:10:25,97
to steer clear of these

293
0:10:25,97 --> 0:10:27,19
traps set by the wealthy

294
0:10:27,19 --> 0:10:27,81
Actually

295
0:10:27,81 --> 0:10:31,25
the gap between the rich and the average person is growing wider

296
0:10:31,25 --> 0:10:32,51
How to put it

297
0:10:32,51 --> 0:10:33,99
with urban development

298
0:10:33,99 --> 0:10:37,21
As our country gradually becomes a middle-developed nation,

299
0:10:37,21 --> 0:10:39,51
you'll notice that many challenges arise,

300
0:10:39,51 --> 0:10:42,12
the routine growth rate slows down,

301
0:10:42,12 --> 0:10:44,5
and we're starting to experience the ailments of developed countries.

302
0:10:44,5 --> 0:10:45,64
So, to put it this way,

303
0:10:45,64 --> 0:10:47,79
finance can be a source of evil,

304
0:10:47,79 --> 0:10:50,47
its existence has made many people wealthy,

305
0:10:50,47 --> 0:10:53,62
and it has also indirectly helped many others gain wealth,

306
0:10:55,1 --> 0:10:57,28
the distribution of wealth is certainly consistent.

307
0:10:57,28 --> 0:11:0,9
This thing has made money off you.

308
0:11:0,9 --> 0:11:1,77
It's raking in the profits.

309
0:11:1,77 --> 0:11:3,77
If Ant Financial can go public and do all sorts of things,

310
0:11:3,77 --> 0:11:5,55
then other places are bound to suffer.

311
0:11:5,55 --> 0:11:6,4
Right?

312
0:11:6,4 --> 0:11:9,28
All the internet financial products you see as great,

313
0:11:9,28 --> 0:11:11,99
have countless people bearing the brunt behind the scenes.

314
0:11:11,99 --> 0:11:13,67
So, who is bearing the brunt?

315
0:11:13,67 --> 0:11:14,81
A large number of left-behind children.

316
0:11:14,81 --> 0:11:15,83
A large number of Generation Z

317
0:11:15,83 --> 0:11:16,53
Millennials

318
0:11:16,53 --> 0:11:17,95
many people are in debt

319
0:11:17,95 --> 0:11:18,85
so when we talk about it

320
0:11:18,85 --> 0:11:21,17
sometimes we have to fill this gap

321
0:11:21,17 --> 0:11:22,819
if we can't fill this gap

322
0:11:22,819 --> 0:11:24,359
I'll be filling this bottomless pit

323
0:11:24,359 --> 0:11:25,819
then we can only avoid this pit

324
0:11:25,819 --> 0:11:28,139
that's why I named this book 'Avoiding the Pit'

325
0:11:28,139 --> 0:11:31,7
There are some abysses that you can't see.

326
0:11:31,7 --> 0:11:36,29
And it's designed to make people fall into these unseen abysses.

327
0:11:36,29 --> 0:11:37,65
So, to put it this way,

328
0:11:37,65 --> 0:11:39,17
as someone who can't fall in,

329
0:11:39,17 --> 0:11:43,7
or as someone who knows how they design these traps,

330
0:11:43,7 --> 0:11:43,59
to put it this way,

331
0:11:43,59 --> 0:11:44,87
I'll be standing right next to your ear,

332
0:11:44,87 --> 0:11:45,89
only able to give you a single warning,

333
0:11:45,89 --> 0:11:48,9
I can't set up warning signs for you.

334
0:11:48,9 --> 0:11:49,81
Then tell you not to go there

335
0:11:49,81 --> 0:11:52,84
I can only talk to those who are willing to listen

336
0:11:52,84 --> 0:11:54,76
whisper softly in your ear

337
0:11:54,76 --> 0:11:58,4
When so-called angels and devils are vying for human souls

338
0:11:58,4 --> 0:11:58,839
it’s always like this

339
0:11:58,839 --> 0:12:0,419
only able to murmur by your side

340
0:12:0,419 --> 0:12:4,51
and can’t actually use my own fate to interfere

341
0:12:4,51 --> 0:12:5,75
because when it comes to many things

342
0:12:5,75 --> 0:12:6,75
they all pertain to financial reform

343
0:12:7,31 --> 0:12:9,22
It's a necessity for development.

344
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:9,64
Isn't it?

345
0:12:9,64 --> 0:12:10,56
That's perfectly normal.

346
0:12:10,56 --> 0:12:12,16
We're becoming more and more like the United States.

347
0:12:12,16 --> 0:12:13,44
I often say two things.

348
0:12:13,44 --> 0:12:16,81
The U.S. and China are two relatively normal countries.

349
0:12:16,81 --> 0:12:18,55
We're becoming more and more like the United States.

350
0:12:18,55 --> 0:12:19,69
Sometimes I would say,

351
0:12:19,69 --> 0:12:21,57
Japan serves as a cautionary tale for our development.

352
0:12:21,57 --> 0:12:23,82
Sometimes we're becoming more and more like Japan.

353
0:12:23,82 --> 0:12:26,38
So in many ways, we are quite similar to Japan and the United States.

354
0:12:26,38 --> 0:12:28,1
There are a lot of similarities.

355
0:12:28,1 --> 0:12:29,89
We are also an Eastern country.

356
0:12:29,89 --> 0:12:31,13
But when it comes to the economy,

357
0:12:31,13 --> 0:12:32,1
and in terms of culture,

358
0:12:32,1 --> 0:12:33,85
in certain aspects,

359
0:12:33,85 --> 0:12:36,33
we don't really have that many differences with the United States.

360
0:12:36,33 --> 0:12:38,329
We are gradually moving in the same direction as the United States.

361
0:12:38,329 --> 0:12:39,409
Of course,

362
0:12:39,409 --> 0:12:41,209
we won’t have some of the issues that the United States has,

363
0:12:41,209 --> 0:12:42,169
but,

364
0:12:42,169 --> 0:12:45,69
the United States has also encountered some problems during its development,

365
0:12:45,69 --> 0:12:46,829
and there’s a chance we might be affected by them,

366
0:12:46,829 --> 0:12:50,53
so it’s hard to be completely clear about this matter,

367
0:12:50,53 --> 0:12:51,89
but no matter what,

368
0:12:51,89 --> 0:12:53,49
from an individual perspective,

369
0:12:53,49 --> 0:12:55,47
a person has to take some risks in life.

370
0:12:55,47 --> 0:12:58,769
So we should take the risks that can be managed

371
0:12:58,769 --> 0:13:1,309
and avoid the ones that cannot be controlled

372
0:13:1,309 --> 0:13:4,61
for example, opening a coffee shop is an unmanageable risk

373
0:13:4,61 --> 0:13:8,58
but trying out different paths in your own life

374
0:13:8,58 --> 0:13:10,86
is a controllable risk

375
0:13:10,86 --> 0:13:14,51
Many people, to put it simply

376
0:13:14,51 --> 0:13:16,15
don't live their lives with clarity

377
0:13:16,15 --> 0:13:20,71
they don't have a good mindset or operating system

378
0:13:20,71 --> 0:13:22,85
and their parents haven't provided them with such a system

379
0:13:22,85 --> 0:13:25,89
The school system is clearly not designed to teach him to think in such a way.

380
0:13:25,89 --> 0:13:27,37
So, generally speaking,

381
0:13:27,37 --> 0:13:29,97
to achieve a relatively happy state in life,

382
0:13:29,97 --> 0:13:33,11
I said it's not entirely related,

383
0:13:33,11 --> 0:13:34,47
from a metaphysical perspective,

384
0:13:34,47 --> 0:13:35,51
what books you read,

385
0:13:35,51 --> 0:13:36,57
what scriptures you study,

386
0:13:36,57 --> 0:13:37,85
how you practice,

387
0:13:37,85 --> 0:13:40,45
how you adjust your breathing,

388
0:13:40,45 --> 0:13:41,57
what kind of elixirs you take,

389
0:13:41,57 --> 0:13:43,41
you can reach a certain state.

390
0:13:43,41 --> 0:13:44,69
But in the real world,

391
0:13:44,69 --> 0:13:46,25
in the secular life,

392
0:13:46,25 --> 0:13:48,49
the most important thing is to have a good grasp of money.

393
0:13:48,49 --> 0:13:50,98
Look at the Jews, they only think about one thing every day,

394
0:13:50,98 --> 0:13:53,54
how to use their money to make more money,

395
0:13:53,54 --> 0:13:55,18
how to save money and earn compound interest.

396
0:13:55,18 --> 0:13:57,2
This is why Jews can rise to the top of human society,

397
0:13:57,2 --> 0:13:58,13
and there's a reason for that.

398
0:13:58,13 --> 0:14:0,1
It's not about being obsessed with money,

399
0:14:0,1 --> 0:14:2,85
but you need to be aware of the various traps money can create,

400
0:14:2,85 --> 0:14:3,87
and anticipate them,

401
0:14:3,87 --> 0:14:4,75
and foresee them.

402
0:14:4,75 --> 0:14:6,72
That's the right attitude towards life.

403
0:14:6,72 --> 0:14:8,28
Speaking of which,

404
0:14:8,28 --> 0:14:11,16
when we talk about all these things in life,

405
0:14:11,16 --> 0:14:13,1
it's crucial to take risks at critical moments.

406
0:14:13,1 --> 0:14:15,59
So all these things that seem negative,

407
0:14:15,59 --> 0:14:17,37
in a certain sense,

408
0:14:17,37 --> 0:14:20,47
will eventually be transformed into something positive.

409
0:14:20,47 --> 0:14:22,1
Where does positivity come from?

410
0:14:22,1 --> 0:14:24,13
It comes from the gradual transformation of negativity.

411
0:14:24,13 --> 0:14:25,65
Your approach to handling it is different,

412
0:14:25,65 --> 0:14:27,31
the way you perceive it is different,

413
0:14:27,31 --> 0:14:28,85
the way you experience it is different,

414
0:14:28,85 --> 0:14:30,87
you create a new experience.

415
0:14:30,87 --> 0:14:32,43
So, many times,

416
0:14:32,43 --> 0:14:35,19
we talk about life and death,

417
0:14:35,19 --> 0:14:36,63
including joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness,

418
0:14:36,63 --> 0:14:39,37
these are states of your existence,

419
0:14:39,37 --> 0:14:40,57
they are situations,

420
0:14:40,57 --> 0:14:41,41
conditions.

421
0:14:41,41 --> 0:14:43,8
So how do you change these conditions?

422
0:14:43,8 --> 0:14:44,48
To put it simply,

423
0:14:44,48 --> 0:14:45,76
this is crucial.

424
0:14:45,76 --> 0:14:47,56
The only thing we can change is our thoughts,

425
0:14:47,56 --> 0:14:48,52
because when thoughts change,

426
0:14:48,52 --> 0:14:49,44
actions change,

427
0:14:49,44 --> 0:14:50,24
and when actions change,

428
0:14:50,24 --> 0:14:51,42
everything changes.
