0:0:0,62 --> 0:0:1,6
Hello

2
0:0:1,6 --> 0:0:2,8
Here's my new mattress

3
0:0:2,8 --> 0:0:4,49
I'm back from a misdiagnosis

4
0:0:4,49 --> 0:0:5,85
I'm feeling very happy

5
0:0:5,85 --> 0:0:7,67
There was a big conference in Wuzhen

6
0:0:7,67 --> 0:0:10,64
We were told not to disclose the content of the meeting

7
0:0:10,64 --> 0:0:13,74
So, it's basically us UPloaders getting together.

8
0:0:13,74 --> 0:0:16,77
Shared an internal experience exchange

9
0:0:16,77 --> 0:0:19,67
and I took some photos around the venue

10
0:0:19,67 --> 0:0:20,69
Let's take a look at the hotel.

11
0:0:20,69 --> 0:0:23,43
Everyone can check out the previous episode on my page.

12
0:0:23,43 --> 0:0:27,5
In this episode, we'll continue discussing social persuasion.

13
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:28,47
What exactly is social persuasion?

14
0:0:28,47 --> 0:0:31,8
This is another new term brought to you by Brother Rong.

15
0:0:31,8 --> 0:0:35,74
It means shaping individuals according to societal norms.

16
0:0:35,74 --> 0:0:39,42
Look at the mental attitudes of us Gen X and Millennials,

17
0:0:39,42 --> 0:0:40,58
compared to Gen Z,

18
0:0:40,58 --> 0:0:42,62
the attitudes of Gen Z are completely different.

19
0:0:42,62 --> 0:0:45,36
It's clear that people from the 80s

20
0:0:45,36 --> 0:0:49,16
carried a sense of endurance and resilience from the old era

21
0:0:49,16 --> 0:0:50,52
humility

22
0:0:50,52 --> 0:0:51,76
and a deep understanding of etiquette and manners

23
0:0:51,76 --> 0:0:54,1
What I'm saying isn't a commendatory term.

24
0:0:54,1 --> 0:0:56,4
What I'm talking about are actually derogatory words.

25
0:0:56,4 --> 0:0:58,46
because in our time

26
0:0:58,46 --> 0:0:59,6
how can I put it

27
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:1,44
nowadays, people can actually speak their minds

28
0:1:1,44 --> 0:1:2,86
It's like this

29
0:1:2,86 --> 0:1:7,15
The 1980s were actually more open than the 1990s

30
0:1:7,15 --> 0:1:8,27
In terms of ideology

31
0:1:8,27 --> 0:1:9,47
Many aspects of culture and humanities

32
0:1:9,47 --> 0:1:12,93
This was due to the complex international situation

33
0:1:12,93 --> 0:1:14,15
We won't delve into it

34
0:1:14,15 --> 0:1:16,5
Why the 1980s were more open

35
0:1:16,5 --> 0:1:19,2
But this openness in the 1980s had a bit of a backfire

36
0:1:19,2 --> 0:1:20,0
A backfire

37
0:1:20,0 --> 0:1:21,4
That was when people's thoughts

38
0:1:21,4 --> 0:1:23,54
Sometimes it doesn't keep up with the current productive force levels

39
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:26,38
Many people became extremely infatuated with foreign things.

40
0:1:26,38 --> 0:1:28,62
That's why I went all out back then.

41
0:1:28,62 --> 0:1:30,38
People born in the sixties and seventies

42
0:1:30,38 --> 0:1:31,84
People of that era

43
0:1:31,84 --> 0:1:33,4
Those from the sixties and seventies

44
0:1:33,4 --> 0:1:34,94
They went through the 1980s

45
0:1:34,94 --> 0:1:35,62
Reform and Opening up

46
0:1:35,62 --> 0:1:38,12
The initial period after the Reform and Opening up was one of prosperity and vitality.

47
0:1:38,12 --> 0:1:41,43
There was a more comprehensive trend towards Westernization.

48
0:1:41,43 --> 0:1:42,55
People of that era,

49
0:1:42,55 --> 0:1:45,0
generally speaking, were not convinced by the 1990s.

50
0:1:45,0 --> 0:1:47,24
But for those born in the 1980s,

51
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:48,68
like me, who started school in 1990,

52
0:1:48,68 --> 0:1:49,62
or those who started in 1991,

53
0:1:49,62 --> 0:1:52,12
the education of the 1990s,

54
0:1:52,12 --> 0:1:55,26
for us, felt like a process of looking back.

55
0:1:55,26 --> 0:1:56,94
When it comes to our education,

56
0:1:56,94 --> 0:2:0,34
the focus on ideology is still quite tight,

57
0:2:0,34 --> 0:2:3,92
which, of course, has its positive aspects,

58
0:2:3,92 --> 0:2:5,4
but it also has negative impacts.

59
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:8,53
As a result, many of the people who are educated this way tend to be,

60
0:2:8,53 --> 0:2:9,69
very obedient,

61
0:2:9,69 --> 0:2:10,97
very rule-abiding,

62
0:2:10,97 --> 0:2:12,21
very, how should I put it,

63
0:2:12,21 --> 0:2:14,589
attentive to honor and disgrace.

64
0:2:14,589 --> 0:2:17,189
But this matter has its pros and cons.

65
0:2:17,189 --> 0:2:21,17
You need to understand that people survive in society,

66
0:2:21,17 --> 0:2:22,97
and they face different societies,

67
0:2:22,97 --> 0:2:25,37
they adopt different mental states.

68
0:2:25,37 --> 0:2:28,95
Now we live in an urban commercial society,

69
0:2:28,95 --> 0:2:31,5
so some things that showcase individuality,

70
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:33,13
and the initiative of the individual,

71
0:2:33,13 --> 0:2:34,44
are appropriate.

72
0:2:34,44 --> 0:2:37,5
In ancient collective agricultural societies,

73
0:2:37,5 --> 0:2:39,16
Some things are just too unique.

74
0:2:39,16 --> 0:2:40,31
They don't fit in.

75
0:2:40,31 --> 0:2:43,49
So this concept is about how things change over time.

76
0:2:43,49 --> 0:2:45,45
This is a social convention among people

77
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:46,85
including moral values,

78
0:2:46,85 --> 0:2:49,53
what is considered just in society,

79
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:50,85
what should be done,

80
0:2:50,85 --> 0:2:52,29
the public's understanding of moral standards,

81
0:2:52,29 --> 0:2:54,79
are constantly shifting and evolving.

82
0:2:54,79 --> 0:2:57,17
Given that the urbanization rate is now very high

83
0:2:57,17 --> 0:2:58,39
in many cases

84
0:2:58,39 --> 0:3:0,65
from the clan-based rural society

85
0:3:0,65 --> 0:3:2,529
to the current rural society

86
0:3:2,529 --> 0:3:3,729
many people have completed

87
0:3:3,729 --> 0:3:7,46
and through the college entrance exam, they have achieved urbanization

88
0:3:7,46 --> 0:3:9,1
many aspects of their lives have transformed

89
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:11,42
gradually transforming into nuclear families

90
0:3:11,42 --> 0:3:14,94
like my family, which comes from a rural area in Yunnan, right

91
0:3:14,94 --> 0:3:16,36
Then, after entering the city,

92
0:3:16,36 --> 0:3:18,16
everyone has their own profession,

93
0:3:18,16 --> 0:3:18,88
their own division of labor,

94
0:3:18,88 --> 0:3:20,47
and their own distinct residences.

95
0:3:20,47 --> 0:3:22,35
Production is no longer centralized,

96
0:3:22,35 --> 0:3:24,37
so each household has become an atomic family.

97
0:3:24,37 --> 0:3:27,27
In an atomic family, there’s no need to talk about feudal nonsense,

98
0:3:27,27 --> 0:3:28,709
or the hierarchical relationships like ruler and subject, father and son.

99
0:3:28,709 --> 0:3:30,989
So the level of productive force in the new era has improved.

100
0:3:30,989 --> 0:3:32,2
So it's different

101
0:3:32,2 --> 0:3:34,22
But in the 80s, there were many materials

102
0:3:34,22 --> 0:3:35,42
When we talk about those things

103
0:3:35,42 --> 0:3:38,2
In the 90s, there were a lot of social elements left

104
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:40,1
Actually, there were quite a few

105
0:3:40,1 --> 0:3:42,63
It makes you feel, how should I put it

106
0:3:42,63 --> 0:3:43,91
Compliant with the rules

107
0:3:43,91 --> 0:3:46,61
At the same time, it restricts some of your freedoms

108
0:3:46,61 --> 0:3:47,41
Freedoms of thought

109
0:3:47,41 --> 0:3:48,43
Freedom of action

110
0:3:48,43 --> 0:3:50,35
makes you particularly obedient

111
0:3:50,35 --> 0:3:53,43
Often, it will restrict the development of your personal thoughts

112
0:3:53,43 --> 0:3:54,78
Many things are like this

113
0:3:54,78 --> 0:3:55,66
He said slowly

114
0:3:55,66 --> 0:3:56,22
To be honest

115
0:3:56,22 --> 0:3:59,68
Whenever he wants to establish a so-called noble virtue

116
0:3:59,68 --> 0:4:1,62
He has to take something away

117
0:4:1,62 --> 0:4:3,26
So people often say

118
0:4:3,26 --> 0:4:6,32
If someone has never been fully influenced by this education system,

119
0:4:6,32 --> 0:4:7,62
then they might not have been affected by it at all.

120
0:4:7,62 --> 0:4:8,24
Let me explain.

121
0:4:8,24 --> 0:4:11,0
Of course, they might be somewhat lacking culturally,

122
0:4:11,0 --> 0:4:12,2
they might be homeschooled,

123
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:13,65
learning from what their parents teach them,

124
0:4:13,65 --> 0:4:16,5
but they wouldn't be influenced by these social norms.

125
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:18,33
However, they would be lacking in socialization.

126
0:4:18,33 --> 0:4:20,329
They might be less adept in social situations.

127
0:4:20,329 --> 0:4:23,78
So, what exactly makes something natural?

128
0:4:23,78 --> 0:4:24,86
That's hard to say.

129
0:4:24,86 --> 0:4:28,58
But as Generation 80s, we were essentially the guinea pigs.

130
0:4:28,58 --> 0:4:31,16
The truly outstanding generation is the 90s kids.

131
0:4:31,16 --> 0:4:31,9
And the 00s kids.

132
0:4:31,9 --> 0:4:35,7
Why do we say the 90s and 00s generations are more excellent?

133
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:38,95
Because their parents' generation is quite different from ours.

134
0:4:38,95 --> 0:4:40,49
They are different from our grandparents' generation.

135
0:4:40,49 --> 0:4:43,74
Most of the 80s generation's grandparents had experienced war, right?

136
0:4:43,74 --> 0:4:46,9
Well, our parents' generation, some of them even fought in wars.

137
0:4:46,9 --> 0:4:49,669
In the 80s, going to war in Vietnam was quite common.

138
0:4:49,669 --> 0:4:51,149
So, in many cases,

139
0:4:51,149 --> 0:4:52,789
for people from the 60s and 70s,

140
0:4:52,789 --> 0:4:53,309
after getting an education,

141
0:4:53,309 --> 0:4:54,69
they went into business,

142
0:4:54,69 --> 0:4:55,469
and they seized the benefits of their era.

143
0:4:55,469 --> 0:4:56,269
By the 90s,

144
0:4:56,269 --> 0:4:58,42
it was when they were in their twenties and thirties that they made their money.

145
0:4:58,42 --> 0:5:0,66
But for the parents from the post-50s generation,

146
0:5:0,66 --> 0:5:2,5
they were already quite old by then,

147
0:5:2,5 --> 0:5:3,74
with fewer opportunities available.

148
0:5:3,74 --> 0:5:5,1
They also had children to take care of.

149
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:6,15
So,

150
0:5:6,15 --> 0:5:7,67
those born in the 90s,

151
0:5:7,67 --> 0:5:8,79
or after the 90s,

152
0:5:8,79 --> 0:5:10,6
especially the post-95s and the 00s generation,

153
0:5:10,6 --> 0:5:13,74
many have achieved considerable economic success.

154
0:5:13,74 --> 0:5:15,6
Someone with a wealth of knowledge

155
0:5:15,6 --> 0:5:16,789
Because he was born after 1978

156
0:5:16,789 --> 0:5:17,349
1977

157
0:5:17,349 --> 0:5:20,56
High school students who emerged after the restoration of the national unified examination for admissions to general universities and colleges in 1978.

158
0:5:20,56 --> 0:5:22,92
So compared to people from the 1950s

159
0:5:22,92 --> 0:5:24,8
Like my dad, who was born in 1954

160
0:5:24,8 --> 0:5:25,88
And my mom, who was born in 1955, and many others

161
0:5:25,88 --> 0:5:29,68
He actually went through things like being sent to the countryside

162
0:5:29,68 --> 0:5:30,36
Or serving in the military

163
0:5:30,36 --> 0:5:31,56
Or started working in a factory quite early

164
0:5:31,56 --> 0:5:32,8
You see, my dad has 40 years of work experience

165
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:33,88
He started at the factory when he was 15

166
0:5:33,88 --> 0:5:35,34
My mom joined the military at 16

167
0:5:35,34 --> 0:5:37,6
So in terms of education

168
0:5:37,6 --> 0:5:39,15
To put it bluntly, he didn’t even finish high school

169
0:5:39,15 --> 0:5:40,79
He didn’t go to high school

170
0:5:40,79 --> 0:5:42,59
He left after junior high to start learning a trade

171
0:5:42,59 --> 0:5:43,99
And that’s how he started working

172
0:5:43,99 --> 0:5:46,59
So his ability to learn

173
0:5:46,59 --> 0:5:48,51
is related to economic status

174
0:5:48,51 --> 0:5:50,43
and when you consider the older generation

175
0:5:50,43 --> 0:5:51,31
who were involved in wars

176
0:5:51,31 --> 0:5:53,53
their level of education was relatively lower

177
0:5:53,53 --> 0:5:56,17
which affects their cognition and thinking

178
0:5:58,13 --> 0:5:59,659
making it more challenging

179
0:5:59,659 --> 0:6:1,499
unlike people from the 90s

180
0:6:1,499 --> 0:6:2,939
when it comes to certain aspects

181
0:6:2,939 --> 0:6:4,44
How could he put it?

182
0:6:4,44 --> 0:6:5,94
We need to speak from our perspective.

183
0:6:5,94 --> 0:6:6,9
A bit more advanced.

184
0:6:6,9 --> 0:6:9,6
A bit more free-spirited, you know.

185
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:10,409
Not to mention the Gen Zers.

186
0:6:10,409 --> 0:6:13,249
Many of the parents of Gen Zers might be from the Gen X cohort.

187
0:6:13,249 --> 0:6:14,809
For example, my peers

188
0:6:14,809 --> 0:6:16,609
They had Gen Z kids in their twenties.

189
0:6:16,609 --> 0:6:18,93
But those from the seventies were different.

190
0:6:18,93 --> 0:6:19,85
So, to talk about it

191
0:6:19,85 --> 0:6:21,61
you're saying you were born in 09

192
0:6:21,61 --> 0:6:22,93
I could very well be your dad

193
0:6:22,93 --> 0:6:23,53
right?

194
0:6:23,53 --> 0:6:24,13
That's how it is

195
0:6:24,13 --> 0:6:25,669
You were born in 05

196
0:6:25,669 --> 0:6:28,629
I was already 18 in 02

197
0:6:28,629 --> 0:6:32,48
By 09, I was already 25

198
0:6:32,48 --> 0:6:35,16
So if you were born between 05 and 09

199
0:6:35,16 --> 0:6:36,56
Bro Rong might really be your dad.

200
0:6:36,56 --> 0:6:39,16
Hehe, I don't just go around saying things like that to people.

201
0:6:39,16 --> 0:6:40,72
Calling someone my son or something like that.

202
0:6:40,72 --> 0:6:42,84
Because what you say might just come true, you know.

203
0:6:42,84 --> 0:6:44,4
It could become reality, right?

204
0:6:44,4 --> 0:6:46,0
It’s possible, isn’t it?

205
0:6:46,0 --> 0:6:48,43
Who knows, right?

206
0:6:48,43 --> 0:6:49,51
You get the point.

207
0:6:49,51 --> 0:6:50,77
My moral standards aren’t that high either.

208
0:6:50,77 --> 0:6:53,12
This person has a wide circle of friends.

209
0:6:53,12 --> 0:6:54,82
In fact, during that active era,

210
0:6:54,82 --> 0:6:57,85
Who knows what peculiar stories might unfold?

211
0:6:57,85 --> 0:6:59,59
So the key point is,

212
0:6:59,59 --> 0:7:1,65
A Generation has its own Shangganling

213
0:7:1,65 --> 0:7:3,3
A generation has its own way of thinking

214
0:7:3,3 --> 0:7:4,32
How to put it,

215
0:7:4,32 --> 0:7:5,98
the general trend is like this.

216
0:7:5,98 --> 0:7:8,23
So each generation surpasses the last.

217
0:7:8,23 --> 0:7:10,11
Firstly, I believe each generation is stronger than the last.

218
0:7:13,43 --> 0:7:16,24
To surpass the limitations of your time,

219
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:19,6
you must understand that people from other generations have different experiences in society,

220
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:23,1
and their experiences are entirely different from your subjective feelings.

221
0:7:23,1 --> 0:7:24,5
When we talk about Gen Z,

222
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:24,75
or the iGen,

223
0:7:24,75 --> 0:7:25,69
let's not even compare with others.

224
0:7:25,69 --> 0:7:26,63
Just take military enthusiasts for example,

225
0:7:26,63 --> 0:7:28,51
compared to the military enthusiasts from the 80s.

226
0:7:28,51 --> 0:7:29,67
Can the feeling be the same?

227
0:7:29,67 --> 0:7:30,3
Right?

228
0:7:30,3 --> 0:7:31,43
With all this advanced equipment now

229
0:7:31,43 --> 0:7:31,95
So to speak

230
0:7:31,95 --> 0:7:33,6
It's not expensive, to put it bluntly

231
0:7:33,6 --> 0:7:34,32
No, not that

232
0:7:34,32 --> 0:7:36,74
But there were so many things we had to endure in the past

233
0:7:36,74 --> 0:7:38,8
The Chinese embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was bombed

234
0:7:38,8 --> 0:7:40,6
Often, it refers to the Yinhe Incident.

235
0:7:40,6 --> 0:7:41,89
This all brings back memories of our childhood.

236
0:7:41,89 --> 0:7:43,9
So, for us,

237
0:7:43,9 --> 0:7:45,1
he has this sense of enduring hardship and bearing a heavy burden.

238
0:7:45,1 --> 0:7:47,1
For people of our generation,

239
0:7:47,1 --> 0:7:49,78
there wasn't such a strong emphasis on individual development.

240
0:7:49,78 --> 0:7:51,1
Except for someone like Han Han,

241
0:7:51,1 --> 0:7:52,7
everyone thought they were defying conventions.

242
0:7:52,7 --> 0:7:53,86
they were already quite something,

243
0:7:53,86 --> 0:7:54,74
but looking at it now,

244
0:7:54,74 --> 0:7:56,4
Look at what Han Han does

245
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:58,12
There's nothing particularly suspicious about it.

246
0:7:58,12 --> 0:7:59,7
Right, those are things everyone would do

247
0:7:59,7 --> 0:8:1,669
But speaking of our generation and after

248
0:8:1,669 --> 0:8:3,229
Speaking of our generation,

249
0:8:3,229 --> 0:8:4,189
When it comes to certain aspects

250
0:8:4,189 --> 0:8:5,849
They are a generation that bridges the past and the future

251
0:8:5,849 --> 0:8:7,469
They serve as the connecting link between generations

252
0:8:7,469 --> 0:8:8,829
He bears the shadow of the previous generation.

253
0:8:8,829 --> 0:8:10,46
There's also the dawn for the next generation.

254
0:8:10,46 --> 0:8:12,3
So these things are completely different

255
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:14,38
So when we talk about social persuasion

256
0:8:14,38 --> 0:8:15,74
You need to understand your era

257
0:8:15,74 --> 0:8:18,19
So you need to know the characteristics of your era

258
0:8:18,19 --> 0:8:20,8
What the burdens of the times are

259
0:8:20,8 --> 0:8:21,44
This is an inevitable thing

260
0:8:21,44 --> 0:8:23,56
But speaking of our generation

261
0:8:23,56 --> 0:8:25,7
We've encountered something very good, and that is

262
0:8:25,7 --> 0:8:27,2
When we were young

263
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:28,58
When we grew up

264
0:8:28,58 --> 0:8:29,46
We were exposed to games

265
0:8:29,46 --> 0:8:30,24
We were exposed to computers

266
0:8:30,24 --> 0:8:33,51
We were exposed to many advanced cultural models

267
0:8:33,51 --> 0:8:35,41
So we have a good understanding of culture

268
0:8:35,41 --> 0:8:36,35
Of creativity

269
0:8:36,35 --> 0:8:38,67
Of the aspiration for this kind of art

270
0:8:38,67 --> 0:8:39,78
It's really great

271
0:8:39,78 --> 0:8:41,34
So you see, I write books.

272
0:8:41,34 --> 0:8:43,339
Some of my friends play in bands

273
0:8:43,339 --> 0:8:44,659
They make music.

274
0:8:44,659 --> 0:8:45,939
This is a kind of cultural expression,

275
0:8:45,939 --> 0:8:46,459
a longing for freedom,

276
0:8:46,459 --> 0:8:47,299
and a yearning for art.

277
0:8:47,299 --> 0:8:50,24
People can't exist without these spiritual nourishments.

278
0:8:50,24 --> 0:8:53,12
But for our generation, there are many constraints in various aspects,

279
0:8:53,12 --> 0:8:54,8
especially when it comes to personalization.

280
0:8:54,8 --> 0:8:57,4
There's no doubt that the post-90s and post-00s are stronger.

281
0:8:57,4 --> 0:8:59,0
Let's not talk about our generation then.

282
0:8:59,0 --> 0:9:0,4
Just take cosplay for example.

283
0:9:0,4 --> 0:9:4,6
Back then, when we played cosplay, it was a lot more socially challenging.

284
0:9:4,6 --> 0:9:4,58
How can I put it?

285
0:9:4,58 --> 0:9:5,88
The lack of understanding from parents,

286
0:9:5,88 --> 0:9:7,16
and the lack of understanding from society.

287
0:9:7,16 --> 0:9:8,92
Now, it's not really an issue at all.

288
0:9:8,92 --> 0:9:9,86
Is it even an issue now?

289
0:9:9,86 --> 0:9:12,0
Now I'm going out in my cosplay outfit

290
0:9:12,0 --> 0:9:13,599
Taking the subway is no big deal

291
0:9:13,599 --> 0:9:14,839
Everyone finds it quite normal

292
0:9:14,839 --> 0:9:15,859
No one stares at you

293
0:9:15,859 --> 0:9:18,619
No one is constantly accusing you of taking secret photos or anything

294
0:9:18,619 --> 0:9:20,199
Back in 2003 and 2004

295
0:9:20,199 --> 0:9:21,43
Can you give it a try?

296
0:9:21,43 --> 0:9:22,95
I attended my first comic convention in 2003

297
0:9:22,95 --> 0:9:25,3
It felt like we had to do everything secretly

298
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:26,39
It’s not easy for everyone to gather like this

299
0:9:26,39 --> 0:9:27,67
Wow, there’s actually a gathering

300
0:9:27,67 --> 0:9:29,2
And there’s even an opportunity

301
0:9:29,2 --> 0:9:30,1
For everyone to interact

302
0:9:30,1 --> 0:9:30,78
That’s right

303
0:9:30,78 --> 0:9:31,32
It’s quite unusual

304
0:9:31,32 --> 0:9:32,7
The sense of stealth is particularly strong

305
0:9:32,7 --> 0:9:36,62
Unlike now, where almost anyone can just put on a costume

306
0:9:36,62 --> 0:9:38,34
And consider themselves a cosplayer

307
0:9:38,34 --> 0:9:39,54
Let's not comment on that.

308
0:9:39,54 --> 0:9:41,94
But overall, society is changing.

309
0:9:41,94 --> 0:9:44,18
Society is constantly innovating.

310
0:9:44,18 --> 0:9:45,76
Society is becoming more open.

311
0:9:45,76 --> 0:9:47,58
Society is moving forward.

312
0:9:47,58 --> 0:9:49,9
So the feeling is completely different.

313
0:9:49,9 --> 0:9:52,97
So when we talk about a lot of people today,

314
0:9:53,64 --> 0:9:56,32
they tend to impose more restrictions on themselves.

315
0:9:56,32 --> 0:9:57,73
This is the mark of the times.

316
0:9:57,73 --> 0:9:59,55
So we say a lot of things in this context

317
0:9:59,55 --> 0:10:1,15
Due to the existence of the education system

318
0:10:1,15 --> 0:10:2,65
Because of these things

319
0:10:2,65 --> 0:10:4,46
For the majority of people

320
0:10:4,46 --> 0:10:6,84
It involves going through various social systems

321
0:10:6,84 --> 0:10:8,3
To become a part of society

322
0:10:8,3 --> 0:10:8,82
How should I put it

323
0:10:8,82 --> 0:10:9,66
In a functional state

324
0:10:9,66 --> 0:10:10,46
In a state of being the workforce

325
0:10:10,46 --> 0:10:12,62
This is the overarching trend in society.

326
0:10:12,62 --> 0:10:15,99
But if you have the willpower,

327
0:10:15,99 --> 0:10:19,43
and the intention to take the initiative in this society,

328
0:10:19,43 --> 0:10:23,46
you need to go against the social trends that influence you,

329
0:10:23,46 --> 0:10:24,14
against the advice,

330
0:10:24,14 --> 0:10:24,74
against the influences,

331
0:10:24,74 --> 0:10:26,51
you need to be a rebel,

332
0:10:26,51 --> 0:10:29,7
you need to make choices different from the era,

333
0:10:29,7 --> 0:10:30,27
different from others.

334
0:10:30,27 --> 0:10:32,83
It's important to find a path that suits you.

335
0:10:32,83 --> 0:10:33,87
This is crucial.

336
0:10:33,87 --> 0:10:34,75
And I feel that

337
0:10:34,75 --> 0:10:38,51
More and more parents nowadays are unwilling to push their children into the rat race of academics.

338
0:10:38,51 --> 0:10:40,49
Instead, they encourage them to find a path that suits them.

339
0:10:40,49 --> 0:10:42,37
When we talk about the world at large,

340
0:10:42,37 --> 0:10:43,13
Becoming a scientist,

341
0:10:43,13 --> 0:10:43,89
Becoming an engineer,

342
0:10:43,89 --> 0:10:44,41
Becoming a doctor

343
0:10:44,41 --> 0:10:46,45
Being a lawyer is a very honorable profession.

344
0:10:46,45 --> 0:10:48,13
But that doesn't mean becoming an artist

345
0:10:48,13 --> 0:10:49,1
or a businessman

346
0:10:49,1 --> 0:10:49,98
or a young actor

347
0:10:49,98 --> 0:10:51,6
or a small craftsman

348
0:10:51,6 --> 0:10:52,98
or an individual entrepreneur is something to be ashamed of.

349
0:10:52,98 --> 0:10:54,82
So this was the attitude of that era.

350
0:10:54,82 --> 0:10:56,49
For college students

351
0:10:56,49 --> 0:10:57,85
and for intellectuals

352
0:10:57,85 --> 0:11:0,73
An aspiration for the cadre status

353
0:11:0,73 --> 0:11:2,18
A romanticization

354
0:11:2,18 --> 0:11:2,94
A tribute

355
0:11:2,94 --> 0:11:4,3
A choice made by many

356
0:11:4,3 --> 0:11:6,65
Because cadres and college graduates earn more money

357
0:11:6,65 --> 0:11:9,1
But in today's context

358
0:11:9,1 --> 0:11:10,93
A college degree might not be as valuable

359
0:11:10,93 --> 0:11:13,16
From the perspective of labor surplus

360
0:11:13,16 --> 0:11:14,36
We need to delve into this issue further

361
0:11:14,36 --> 0:11:16,88
What should I contribute to this socio-economic environment?

362
0:11:16,88 --> 0:11:18,52
This is the mindset of the new era.

363
0:11:18,52 --> 0:11:20,3
It's already 2025 now.

364
0:11:20,3 --> 0:11:22,27
A quarter of the 21st century has passed.

365
0:11:22,27 --> 0:11:25,51
So many people's lives and moods are still stuck in the 1990s.

366
0:11:25,51 --> 0:11:26,88
Still stuck in the 2000s.

367
0:11:26,88 --> 0:11:29,64
But in reality, 40 years have gone by.

368
0:11:29,64 --> 0:11:31,8
Yes, 40 years have passed.

369
0:11:31,8 --> 0:11:31,66
Right?

370
0:11:31,66 --> 0:11:34,38
So, from a physiological standpoint

371
0:11:34,38 --> 0:11:35,14
As someone from the 80s

372
0:11:35,14 --> 0:11:37,34
I feel that sometimes my mindset is more open than those from the 90s

373
0:11:37,34 --> 0:11:38,82
Maybe even more so

374
0:11:38,82 --> 0:11:40,16
Let's be honest

375
0:11:40,16 --> 0:11:41,12
The specific reasons

376
0:11:41,12 --> 0:11:42,96
We won't delve into further

377
0:11:42,96 --> 0:11:44,5
It's not really worth discussing

378
0:11:44,5 --> 0:11:45,93
Because it's all in the past

379
0:11:45,93 --> 0:11:47,85
So discussing these things today

380
0:11:47,85 --> 0:11:49,85
The dynamics of cultural and international relations

381
0:11:49,85 --> 0:11:50,93
Have a lasting impact on an era

382
0:11:50,93 --> 0:11:52,29
And on individuals

383
0:11:52,29 --> 0:11:53,19
They all have an influence

384
0:11:53,19 --> 0:11:54,95
This is the most interesting part

385
0:11:54,95 --> 0:11:58,27
So many times, people need to learn to reflect

386
0:11:58,27 --> 0:11:59,99
Not the kind of reflection that blames

387
0:11:59,99 --> 0:12:2,87
But to learn to see the small things in oneself

388
0:12:2,87 --> 0:12:4,81
When it comes to me, don't be so fixated.

389
0:12:4,81 --> 0:12:8,0
I shouldn't be so fixated on what I believe is right as being absolutely right

390
0:12:8,0 --> 0:12:10,36
I shouldn't be so fixated on what my generation believes is right as being absolutely right

391
0:12:10,36 --> 0:12:11,88
This is something that can be debated

392
0:12:11,88 --> 0:12:13,62
Each generation should be stronger than the last

393
0:12:13,62 --> 0:12:15,58
Each generation should be better than the previous one

394
0:12:15,58 --> 0:12:17,18
So in many ways

395
0:12:17,18 --> 0:12:18,7
The times are moving forward relentlessly

396
0:12:18,7 --> 0:12:20,66
Let me tell you

397
0:12:20,66 --> 0:12:21,38
I really envy today's young people

398
0:12:21,38 --> 0:12:23,9
And I will always envy the young people of my time

399
0:12:23,9 --> 0:12:26,54
I never think any generation of young people is weaker than the previous one

400
0:12:26,54 --> 0:12:30,23
But to be honest, each generation has its own sacrifices

401
0:12:30,23 --> 0:12:33,83
But to be honest, every generation has its own spirit of sacrifice.

402
0:12:33,83 --> 0:12:35,31
We were the guinea pigs

403
0:12:35,31 --> 0:12:36,92
We were a generation of experiments

404
0:12:36,92 --> 0:12:38,56
So it's normal that many from the 80s faced more hardships

405
0:12:38,56 --> 0:12:41,4
That's quite natural

406
0:12:41,4 --> 0:12:41,62
But for our generation

407
0:12:41,62 --> 0:12:43,36
We need to learn from the new generation

408
0:12:43,36 --> 0:12:45,75
We need to learn from the various qualities of the new generation

409
0:12:45,75 --> 0:12:48,3
Not being burdened by outdated thoughts is crucial

410
0:12:48,3 --> 0:12:49,99
You should grow younger as you live

411
0:12:49,99 --> 0:12:52,38
So don't carry the burden of old thoughts

412
0:12:52,38 --> 0:12:54,26
Don't conform to societal norms

413
0:12:54,26 --> 0:12:55,54
There are many pieces of advice for you

414
0:12:55,54 --> 0:12:56,74
There are many of these things

415
0:12:56,74 --> 0:12:58,0
If you don't want to become that kind of person

416
0:12:58,0 --> 0:12:59,6
Then don't make that choice

417
0:12:59,6 --> 0:13:1,24
This is what I feel today
