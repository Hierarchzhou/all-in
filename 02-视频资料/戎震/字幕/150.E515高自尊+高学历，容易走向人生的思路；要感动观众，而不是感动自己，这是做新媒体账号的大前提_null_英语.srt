0:0:0,24 --> 0:0:1,28
Hi everyone!

2
0:0:1,28 --> 0:0:3,0
Here’s another episode of Bedtime Chat.

3
0:0:3,0 --> 0:0:6,24
For this new episode of Bedtime Chat, I started recording at midnight.

4
0:0:6,24 --> 0:0:8,4
And I’ll release it by around two in the morning.

5
0:0:8,4 --> 0:0:12,65
This is the prime time for emotional content on Bilibili during the night.

6
0:0:12,65 --> 0:0:14,69
The traffic during this period,

7
0:0:14,69 --> 0:0:16,57
is generally higher.

8
0:0:17,38 --> 0:0:20,1
Yesterday, due to the earthquake in Beijing,

9
0:0:20,1 --> 0:0:22,2
I was really scared.

10
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:23,76
I didn't get much sleep last night.

11
0:0:23,76 --> 0:0:24,9
Hardly slept at all.

12
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:27,4
I only managed to fall asleep when it was just getting light, around five.

13
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:32,36
So I spent most of yesterday watching videos.

14
0:0:33,33 --> 0:0:34,95
There was this one older guy,

15
0:0:34,95 --> 0:0:37,5
who is a Ph.D. from Peking University.

16
0:0:37,5 --> 0:0:38,5
I'm not sure what his specific field is,

17
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:38,97
though.

18
0:0:38,97 --> 0:0:41,47
He mentioned that he wants to become a knowledge creator.

19
0:0:41,47 --> 0:0:44,59
And every day

20
0:0:45,47 --> 0:0:48,2
he reads 150 pages of books every day

21
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:49,26
without fail

22
0:0:49,26 --> 0:0:50,4
while others play games

23
0:0:50,4 --> 0:0:52,6
he focuses on reading

24
0:0:52,6 --> 0:0:54,12
others have top-notch computer setups

25
0:0:54,12 --> 0:0:56,6
the school gives him the worst one

26
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:57,7
why does he read so much

27
0:0:57,7 --> 0:0:58,84
apart from reading

28
0:0:58,84 --> 0:1:0,8
He doesn't do anything at all.

29
0:1:0,8 --> 0:1:2,7
But he thinks he's so great.

30
0:1:2,7 --> 0:1:4,31
He's very proud of himself.

31
0:1:4,31 --> 0:1:5,83
And he said his kid came over to play with him.

32
0:1:5,83 --> 0:1:6,67
He does that too.

33
0:1:6,67 --> 0:1:7,63
Reading books.

34
0:1:7,63 --> 0:1:8,81
Without fail.

35
0:1:8,81 --> 0:1:10,65
He used to write doctoral dissertations for others.

36
0:1:10,65 --> 0:1:11,43
To earn some extra money.

37
0:1:11,43 --> 0:1:12,35
So then

38
0:1:12,35 --> 0:1:14,53
but later it delayed my reading time

39
0:1:14,53 --> 0:1:16,7
so I have to read again

40
0:1:16,7 --> 0:1:17,34
got to read

41
0:1:17,34 --> 0:1:19,62
I don’t know how this guy is doing now

42
0:1:19,62 --> 0:1:20,56
how many followers he has

43
0:1:20,56 --> 0:1:23,22
but to be honest

44
0:1:24,199 --> 0:1:25,719
because I feel like I still have something to say

45
0:1:25,719 --> 0:1:30,239
since I’m in the knowledge category

46
0:1:31,82 --> 0:1:33,26
And his high self-esteem

47
0:1:33,26 --> 0:1:38,3
A combination of high self-esteem and high education is particularly disastrous

48
0:1:38,58 --> 0:1:42,28
Because a person spends too much time on their studies

49
0:1:42,28 --> 0:1:44,18
He must be very good at exams

50
0:1:44,18 --> 0:1:45,44
And extremely knowledgeable

51
0:1:45,44 --> 0:1:51,31
But what's most important in society is making money

52
0:1:51,31 --> 0:1:52,21
Some people say

53
0:1:52,21 --> 0:1:52,89
Money isn't everything

54
0:1:52,89 --> 0:1:54,74
In the end, I want to enjoy life

55
0:1:54,74 --> 0:1:56,14
He already has kids

56
0:1:56,14 --> 0:1:57,5
Can you say money isn't important?

57
0:1:57,5 --> 0:1:58,17
Right?

58
0:1:58,17 --> 0:2:2,13
Having a family is a whole different ball game compared to not having one

59
0:2:2,13 --> 0:2:3,33
When you don’t have a family or aren’t married

60
0:2:3,33 --> 0:2:3,93
Without kids

61
0:2:3,93 --> 0:2:5,22
You can say that

62
0:2:5,22 --> 0:2:7,12
I do it for this hobby

63
0:2:7,12 --> 0:2:8,38
For the ideals, poetry, and distant dreams

64
0:2:8,38 --> 0:2:10,12
I go abroad to study every day

65
0:2:10,12 --> 0:2:11,74
I travel abroad every day

66
0:2:11,74 --> 0:2:14,9
I can live and travel anywhere

67
0:2:14,9 --> 0:2:17,82
Just like that guy who fights in the ring

68
0:2:17,82 --> 0:2:20,86
Isn't it that in the end, there's no money when Mom gets sick?

69
0:2:20,86 --> 0:2:22,12
Crying poor to net friends

70
0:2:22,12 --> 0:2:23,4
Finally, scraping together some money

71
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:25,4
Then going back to full armor fighting

72
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:28,82
Many such men have high self-esteem

73
0:2:28,82 --> 0:2:32,84
Actually, it means you haven’t figured yourself out.

74
0:2:32,84 --> 0:2:34,28
If a person is poor,

75
0:2:34,28 --> 0:2:35,0
and has a high sense of self-respect,

76
0:2:35,0 --> 0:2:37,28
that can be a really tough situation.

77
0:2:37,28 --> 0:2:39,2
Especially for those with high education.

78
0:2:39,44 --> 0:2:40,44
People with high education,

79
0:2:40,44 --> 0:2:42,44
don’t assume that

80
0:2:43,36 --> 0:2:45,92
having a high education means you’re highly capable,

81
0:2:45,92 --> 0:2:48,23
or that you understand society very well.

82
0:2:48,23 --> 0:2:52,27
Because, ultimately, society values your ability to earn money.

83
0:2:52,27 --> 0:2:54,31
The ability to earn money is truly important.

84
0:2:54,31 --> 0:2:56,459
But the real money is what you actually earn.

85
0:2:56,459 --> 0:2:58,399
Figuring out how to do this takes time.

86
0:2:58,399 --> 0:3:0,479
It’s a long process.

87
0:3:2,779 --> 0:3:5,179
Interpersonal skills and reading people are crucial.

88
0:3:5,179 --> 0:3:6,19
These are things you need to learn.

89
0:3:6,19 --> 0:3:7,619
You have to take a business approach.

90
0:3:7,619 --> 0:3:8,399
And you need to be able to estimate prices.

91
0:3:8,399 --> 0:3:10,39
To assess this trend

92
0:3:10,39 --> 0:3:10,919
To gauge the demand

93
0:3:10,919 --> 0:3:12,6
It's all the same

94
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:14,5
Including what I've been telling everyone for a long time

95
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:14,98
When you're in business

96
0:3:14,98 --> 0:3:17,18
At the beginning, it might be about curbing your spending urges

97
0:3:17,18 --> 0:3:17,96
To save money

98
0:3:17,96 --> 0:3:21,16
To keep your finances in check

99
0:3:22,76 --> 0:3:24,68
And I'm not sure if it's humility or something else

100
0:3:24,68 --> 0:3:26,959
Anyway, the money earned isn't particularly high.

101
0:3:26,959 --> 0:3:28,759
The personal funds are quite limited.

102
0:3:28,759 --> 0:3:30,559
Of course, it might be because of the PhD.

103
0:3:30,559 --> 0:3:32,439
When it comes to housing, though,

104
0:3:32,439 --> 0:3:34,769
the benefits from the school might be a bit better.

105
0:3:34,769 --> 0:3:36,409
But apart from the PhDs I know,

106
0:3:37,489 --> 0:3:41,579
most people are living quite modestly.

107
0:3:41,579 --> 0:3:43,339
But to be honest with you,

108
0:3:43,339 --> 0:3:48,27
I feel like, apart from one or two people,

109
0:3:48,27 --> 0:3:52,98
He's truly a very successful doctor in the business world.

110
0:3:53,22 --> 0:3:54,28
Unexpectedly.

111
0:3:54,28 --> 0:3:57,16
The rest of these doctors are typically highly educated.

112
0:3:57,16 --> 0:3:58,66
And they earn a modest income.

113
0:3:58,66 --> 0:4:1,49
Yet, they have exceptionally strong egos.

114
0:4:1,49 --> 0:4:3,21
You can see he just can't accept this reality.

115
0:4:3,21 --> 0:4:4,91
So his stress will keep piling up.

116
0:4:4,91 --> 0:4:7,93
Because many of his aspirations for reality

117
0:4:7,93 --> 0:4:9,75
Are quite idealistic.

118
0:4:9,75 --> 0:4:11,43
I often say that idealism can be fatal.

119
0:4:11,43 --> 0:4:15,39
Especially when you hit your thirties or forties.

120
0:4:16,42 --> 0:4:19,26
If your expectations of society remain idealistic,

121
0:4:19,26 --> 0:4:24,6
it means you're not well-prepared for the practical aspects of living in it,

122
0:4:24,6 --> 0:4:25,26
especially when it comes to starting a family.

123
0:4:25,26 --> 0:4:27,74
You'll find yourself struggling to make ends meet.

124
0:4:27,74 --> 0:4:30,1
Many people simply can't adapt to society.

125
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:31,38
It's not that they can't adapt to the world as it is,

126
0:4:31,38 --> 0:4:36,8
but they think making money is degrading.

127
0:4:36,8 --> 0:4:38,12
Thinking about these things is really quite base.

128
0:4:38,12 --> 0:4:39,48
One should have people fawning over them.

129
0:4:39,48 --> 0:4:40,16
People groveling.

130
0:4:40,16 --> 0:4:41,57
People carrying them in a sedan chair.

131
0:4:41,57 --> 0:4:43,919
He feels quite pleased with himself.

132
0:4:43,919 --> 0:4:45,139
That's not the case.

133
0:4:45,139 --> 0:4:46,279
Most importantly, when it comes to being a person,

134
0:4:46,279 --> 0:4:48,659
It's crucial to meet others' expectations of you.

135
0:4:48,659 --> 0:4:50,959
These expectations can be seen as a kind of demand.

136
0:4:50,959 --> 0:4:52,64
It can also be referred to as demand.

137
0:4:52,88 --> 0:4:55,96
For example, the expectations people have of me.

138
0:4:56,75 --> 0:4:59,51
They hope I talk about topics that I find interesting.

139
0:4:59,51 --> 0:5:2,19
So I need to pay attention to what topics people are into.

140
0:5:2,19 --> 0:5:3,6
What they are interested in.

141
0:5:3,6 --> 0:5:5,36
I’ll talk about those topics.

142
0:5:5,36 --> 0:5:6,98
If I don’t understand those topics.

143
0:5:6,98 --> 0:5:8,4
Then I need to read up on them.

144
0:5:8,4 --> 0:5:8,94
I need to do some research.

145
0:5:8,94 --> 0:5:9,58
Is that right?

146
0:5:9,58 --> 0:5:11,78
If I read 150 pages a day

147
0:5:11,78 --> 0:5:13,4
it's a fixed quantity, you see

148
0:5:13,4 --> 0:5:14,74
it's like telling yourself

149
0:5:14,74 --> 0:5:16,6
I need to review for 300 days

150
0:5:16,6 --> 0:5:17,14
I need to get into Peking University

151
0:5:17,14 --> 0:5:19,2
of course, he has already been admitted to Peking University

152
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:22,1
his life has been relatively smooth

153
0:5:22,1 --> 0:5:23,66
it's easy to develop a path dependency

154
0:5:23,66 --> 0:5:26,169
Once you believe you've succeeded at something

155
0:5:26,169 --> 0:5:28,49
you tend to keep pushing yourself

156
0:5:28,49 --> 0:5:28,769
to be disciplined

157
0:5:28,769 --> 0:5:30,729
which leads to success

158
0:5:31,35 --> 0:5:33,31
Many people don't understand this

159
0:5:33,86 --> 0:5:36,58
when it comes to touching yourself or touching others

160
0:5:36,58 --> 0:5:38,6
who should you choose to touch

161
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:40,92
You should choose to touch others

162
0:5:40,92 --> 0:5:42,38
rather than yourself

163
0:5:42,38 --> 0:5:45,8
You have to deceive yourself.

164
0:5:45,8 --> 0:5:47,16
Intense self-deception.

165
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:49,76
Only by fooling yourself can you

166
0:5:49,76 --> 0:5:53,94
break free from your emotional traps.

167
0:5:53,94 --> 0:5:55,62
As long as your emotions are right,

168
0:5:55,62 --> 0:5:57,0
your physical state is right,

169
0:5:57,0 --> 0:6:2,65
then you’ll find that everything you do will be much more efficient.

170
0:6:2,65 --> 0:6:5,17
Some people watch me record videos

171
0:6:5,17 --> 0:6:5,85
while eating.

172
0:6:5,85 --> 0:6:8,63
He gets particularly impatient.

173
0:6:8,63 --> 0:6:9,95
This impatience of yours.

174
0:6:9,95 --> 0:6:12,63
You need to understand the reason behind this impatience.

175
0:6:13,63 --> 0:6:15,76
It's not because you think my video is too slow.

176
0:6:15,76 --> 0:6:17,74
It's because you feel disrespected.

177
0:6:17,74 --> 0:6:20,52
This feeling of disrespect comes from.

178
0:6:20,52 --> 0:6:23,2
Your belief that you deserve respect.

179
0:6:23,26 --> 0:6:25,16
Do you really believe you deserve respect?

180
0:6:25,16 --> 0:6:27,48
What have you done to earn respect from others?

181
0:6:27,48 --> 0:6:29,42
Why can't you get things done when others don't respect you?

182
0:6:29,42 --> 0:6:30,82
Is it because you can't function without respect?

183
0:6:30,82 --> 0:6:32,96
What is the essence of respect?

184
0:6:32,96 --> 0:6:33,94
Is it equality?

185
0:6:33,94 --> 0:6:35,74
Or is it about having a certain status?

186
0:6:35,74 --> 0:6:37,7
Is it about a hierarchical relationship?

187
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:39,42
Is it about a seniority-based respect?

188
0:6:39,42 --> 0:6:40,14
Is it about order?

189
0:6:40,14 --> 0:6:41,76
Is it about some feudal concept?

190
0:6:41,76 --> 0:6:44,79
So you can't stand seeing others living freely.

191
0:6:44,79 --> 0:6:46,91
This is the core issue with this person.

192
0:6:46,91 --> 0:6:50,55
He wants to make money, you see.

193
0:6:50,55 --> 0:6:51,79
He wants to have paternal authority,

194
0:6:51,79 --> 0:6:52,95
and marital authority,

195
0:6:52,95 --> 0:6:56,38
and the power to dominate others.

196
0:6:56,38 --> 0:6:57,88
And others have to cater to him.

197
0:6:57,88 --> 0:7:0,2
So this kind of person is actually the easiest to deal with.

198
0:7:0,2 --> 0:7:0,94
That's the intelligentsia.

199
0:7:0,94 --> 0:7:3,27
Especially, the high-ranking intelligentsia are the easiest to deal with.

200
0:7:3,27 --> 0:7:5,31
That's why I say many PhDs and such.

201
0:7:5,31 --> 0:7:9,7
In terms of personal conduct, one still needs to be particularly cautious.

202
0:7:9,7 --> 0:7:11,1
If you are studying sociology,

203
0:7:11,1 --> 0:7:11,58
historiography,

204
0:7:11,58 --> 0:7:12,94
or any of the humanities,

205
0:7:12,94 --> 0:7:16,74
these PhDs might be more adept in this aspect.

206
0:7:16,74 --> 0:7:17,78
Those from Shanke,

207
0:7:19,86 --> 0:7:20,94
might pay a bit more attention.

208
0:7:20,94 --> 0:7:24,199
But many people struggle with interpersonal skills

209
0:7:24,199 --> 0:7:27,759
when it comes to maintaining these social relations

210
0:7:27,759 --> 0:7:29,739
making money ultimately comes down to one thing

211
0:7:29,739 --> 0:7:31,5
meeting others' needs

212
0:7:31,5 --> 0:7:34,34
the process of fulfilling these needs can involve providing a service

213
0:7:38,64 --> 0:7:41,8
the more frequently you provide this service

214
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:42,92
the higher your chances of earning more

215
0:7:42,92 --> 0:7:43,88
it's that simple

216
0:7:43,88 --> 0:7:46,22
if we look at it from a knowledge perspective

217
0:7:46,84 --> 0:7:48,68
So from the perspective of knowledge,

218
0:7:48,68 --> 0:7:50,68
you need to offer a service to others,

219
0:7:50,68 --> 0:7:52,84
which means you need to have a service mindset,

220
0:7:52,84 --> 0:7:54,57
you need to make people happy,

221
0:7:54,57 --> 0:7:56,69
providing emotional value is essential,

222
0:7:56,69 --> 0:7:59,1
you need to make different people feel good,

223
0:7:59,1 --> 0:8:2,48
which means you have to categorize them into at least 25 personality types,

224
0:8:2,48 --> 0:8:3,56
for different personality types,

225
0:8:3,56 --> 0:8:5,35
you should know how to handle them.

226
0:8:5,35 --> 0:8:6,71
People come from different backgrounds

227
0:8:6,71 --> 0:8:8,57
How you should act like the intelligentsia

228
0:8:8,57 --> 0:8:11,67
Especially, high-ranking intellectuals are quite easy to handle

229
0:8:11,67 --> 0:8:14,99
Very easy indeed

230
0:8:14,99 --> 0:8:15,999
Almost like a textbook

231
0:8:15,999 --> 0:8:18,14
You just need to verify their origins

232
0:8:18,14 --> 0:8:19,94
Make sure it’s not easy to do so

233
0:8:19,94 --> 0:8:22,16
Taking care of their self-esteem is enough

234
0:8:22,16 --> 0:8:23,98
Then, you need to do it in front of them

235
0:8:23,98 --> 0:8:25,46
You come across as very humble

236
0:8:25,46 --> 0:8:27,42
showing a great deal of respect to him

237
0:8:27,42 --> 0:8:28,6
constantly flattering him

238
0:8:28,6 --> 0:8:30,24
even though he might put up various pretenses

239
0:8:30,24 --> 0:8:32,94
he actually enjoys the process immensely

240
0:8:32,94 --> 0:8:35,3
because people like him are often overlooked by society

241
0:8:35,3 --> 0:8:37,35
and not frequently noticed by the general public

242
0:8:37,35 --> 0:8:39,83
so for someone who is not easily noticed

243
0:8:39,83 --> 0:8:41,47
giving them excessive attention

244
0:8:41,47 --> 0:8:44,979
Even if it's fake, giving him too much of this kind of need

245
0:8:44,979 --> 0:8:46,599
He will satisfy those psychological needs

246
0:8:48,119 --> 0:8:52,489
So if someone is in the high-end service industry

247
0:8:52,489 --> 0:8:54,509
They must consider everyone's preferences

248
0:8:54,509 --> 0:8:55,769
Different personalities

249
0:8:55,769 --> 0:8:58,42
At least what the majority of personalities are like

250
0:8:58,42 --> 0:8:59,58
If you don't

251
0:9:1,94 --> 0:9:3,75
Distinguish between people

252
0:9:4,19 --> 0:9:5,81
Categorize people

253
0:9:5,81 --> 0:9:7,61
Different people have different strategies,

254
0:9:7,61 --> 0:9:9,41
you won't be able to adapt to society.

255
0:9:9,41 --> 0:9:10,89
So for many people,

256
0:9:10,89 --> 0:9:13,35
they've spent enough time in the ivory tower at home,

257
0:9:13,35 --> 0:9:14,57
the longer the time,

258
0:9:14,57 --> 0:9:16,31
the more they are surrounded by similar people,

259
0:9:16,31 --> 0:9:18,81
there are no other examples to refer to.

260
0:9:18,81 --> 0:9:20,25
So often,

261
0:9:20,25 --> 0:9:22,81
why some people who stay in academia for too long

262
0:9:22,81 --> 0:9:25,99
You need to readjust to the civil service examination.

263
0:9:25,99 --> 0:9:26,339
Entering society,

264
0:9:26,339 --> 0:9:27,62
he needs to readjust as well.

265
0:9:27,62 --> 0:9:28,7
So often,

266
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:31,1
don't think that you're competing in a fierce battle just to cross a narrow bridge.

267
0:9:31,1 --> 0:9:31,7
Once you make it through,

268
0:9:31,7 --> 0:9:32,86
I got into a 985 or 211 university,

269
0:9:32,86 --> 0:9:34,3
and then I landed a job at a major company.

270
0:9:34,3 --> 0:9:35,67
I went through the selection process.

271
0:9:35,67 --> 0:9:37,53
You would be perfect

272
0:9:37,53 --> 0:9:38,68
No, that's not true

273
0:9:38,68 --> 0:9:41,18
Life isn't just a series of battle royale games

274
0:9:41,18 --> 0:9:42,6
In many cases

275
0:9:42,6 --> 0:9:44,7
People are often eliminated early on

276
0:9:44,7 --> 0:9:47,34
Ordinary girls are often out of the running by their mid-teens

277
0:9:47,34 --> 0:9:48,63
Even when they face society

278
0:9:48,63 --> 0:9:50,45
Others start dating in their mid-twenties

279
0:9:50,45 --> 0:9:52,31
Dating experience is essentially experience in dealing with the opposite sex

280
0:9:52,31 --> 0:9:53,13
It's just richer than you

281
0:9:53,13 --> 0:9:53,99
There's nothing we can do about it

282
0:9:53,99 --> 0:9:55,23
So in many cases

283
0:9:55,23 --> 0:9:58,19
It's not about thinking you're the apple of the world's eye

284
0:9:58,19 --> 0:10:0,3
The world truly recognizes you

285
0:10:0,3 --> 0:10:1,3
You are the apple of the world's eye

286
0:10:1,3 --> 0:10:2,35
To put it bluntly, if you can't make money

287
0:10:2,35 --> 0:10:3,57
You're a failure

288
0:10:3,57 --> 0:10:5,29
Not being able to make money definitely makes you a failure

289
0:10:5,29 --> 0:10:8,67
Earning money, in itself, is about accumulating material wealth.

290
0:10:8,67 --> 0:10:11,12
It’s better for you as a male,

291
0:10:11,12 --> 0:10:15,9
or better for you as a female,

292
0:10:15,9 --> 0:10:16,69
the process of building a family,

293
0:10:16,69 --> 0:10:19,57
the process of raising offspring, all require a foundation of material wealth.

294
0:10:19,57 --> 0:10:21,49
It’s not just about your personal consumption.

295
0:10:21,49 --> 0:10:22,53
Your own consumption,

296
0:10:22,53 --> 0:10:23,41
you can live frugally,

297
0:10:23,41 --> 0:10:24,1
you can go without fancy clothes.

298
0:10:24,1 --> 0:10:24,73
You can go without makeup

299
0:10:24,73 --> 0:10:26,3
You can do nothing at all

300
0:10:26,3 --> 0:10:27,41
Can I bring my child?

301
0:10:27,41 --> 0:10:28,78
Can a child go hungry?

302
0:10:28,78 --> 0:10:30,72
Can a child go without changing their diaper?

303
0:10:30,72 --> 0:10:32,2
Can a child skip school?

304
0:10:32,2 --> 0:10:33,34
Can a child skip medical appointments?

305
0:10:33,34 --> 0:10:34,14
That's impossible

306
0:10:34,14 --> 0:10:36,5
So when you belittle the foundation of material wealth

307
0:10:36,5 --> 0:10:37,62
Often, it's because

308
0:10:37,62 --> 0:10:39,0
you have nothing at all

309
0:10:39,0 --> 0:10:41,74
and in highly educated families like these

310
0:10:41,74 --> 0:10:45,25
it's particularly easy to produce individuals with severely distorted personalities

311
0:10:45,25 --> 0:10:48,13
why are children from teachers' families so often like that

312
0:10:48,13 --> 0:10:51,54
because children from teachers' families are often this way

313
0:10:51,78 --> 0:10:53,9
their income and social status

314
0:10:53,9 --> 0:10:56,34
are not proportional to their need for social respect

315
0:10:56,34 --> 0:10:59,51
because the money you earn doesn't bring you the respect you crave

316
0:10:59,51 --> 0:11:0,11
It's that simple.

317
0:11:0,11 --> 0:11:1,71
So what many people truly need is

318
0:11:1,71 --> 0:11:3,3
respect,

319
0:11:3,3 --> 0:11:4,73
it's about respect.

320
0:11:4,73 --> 0:11:6,15
Money is dignity.

321
0:11:6,15 --> 0:11:7,39
a form of dignity.

322
0:11:7,39 --> 0:11:9,29
When you don't have money,

323
0:11:9,29 --> 0:11:10,69
if you still talk to me in a domineering way,

324
0:11:10,69 --> 0:11:12,25
I'm definitely going to be unfriendly to you.

325
0:11:12,25 --> 0:11:13,17
When you have money

326
0:11:13,17 --> 0:11:14,57
you treat me a bit worse

327
0:11:14,57 --> 0:11:15,41
I can still accept it

328
0:11:15,41 --> 0:11:16,53
That's human nature

329
0:11:16,53 --> 0:11:17,65
So many times

330
0:11:17,65 --> 0:11:20,64
we say you should read 150 pages in a day or so

331
0:11:20,64 --> 0:11:22,28
That's your own requirement

332
0:11:22,28 --> 0:11:24,92
You get yourself all worked up

333
0:11:24,92 --> 0:11:26,69
But it's actually of no use at all

334
0:11:26,69 --> 0:11:28,17
Are you adapting to this society?

335
0:11:28,17 --> 0:11:29,57
You're still earning a few thousand bucks

336
0:11:29,57 --> 0:11:30,64
and you have to support your family

337
0:11:30,64 --> 0:11:31,72
Are you getting used to this society?

338
0:11:31,72 --> 0:11:33,52
Even if you earn 10,000 bucks, so what?

339
0:11:33,52 --> 0:11:35,16
When it comes to a place like Beijing

340
0:11:35,16 --> 0:11:36,829
you're still pretty much nobody

341
0:11:36,829 --> 0:11:38,749
So for me

342
0:11:38,749 --> 0:11:40,589
I think the realization of one's value

343
0:11:40,589 --> 0:11:44,42
The most important thing is to provide shelter and protection for the other family members.

344
0:11:44,42 --> 0:11:45,84
To earn enough money.

345
0:11:45,84 --> 0:11:47,9
On the track of power, wealth, and prestige,

346
0:11:47,9 --> 0:11:49,14
Try to move a bit further ahead.

347
0:11:49,14 --> 0:11:50,1
Try to push a bit more.

348
0:11:50,1 --> 0:11:52,88
If one generation moves forward a bit, they won’t be at a disadvantage.

349
0:11:52,88 --> 0:11:55,48
Then you can leverage the entire family’s strength.

350
0:11:55,48 --> 0:11:57,9
As the first generation to enter the city,

351
0:11:57,9 --> 0:11:58,94
Entering a new city.

352
0:11:58,94 --> 0:11:59,94
When entering a new field,

353
0:11:59,94 --> 0:12:1,54
if you don't expand your family's influence,

354
0:12:1,54 --> 0:12:4,19
the pressure on your children will be immense.

355
0:12:4,19 --> 0:12:6,15
That's why they say, 'Prosperity comes from serving as an official',

356
0:12:6,15 --> 0:12:7,3
and 'Weakness leads to commerce'.

357
0:12:7,3 --> 0:12:7,97
That's how it is.

358
0:12:7,97 --> 0:12:8,71
I told you,

359
0:12:8,71 --> 0:12:9,73
prosperity comes from serving as an official,

360
0:12:9,73 --> 0:12:10,47
but you won't listen.

361
0:12:10,47 --> 0:12:11,869
You insist on taking the civil service exam

362
0:12:11,869 --> 0:12:13,389
Are you aiming to become an official?

363
0:12:13,389 --> 0:12:14,269
You’re a clerk

364
0:12:14,269 --> 0:12:15,89
You’re a low-ranking clerk

365
0:12:15,89 --> 0:12:16,589
You’re a military captain

366
0:12:16,589 --> 0:12:17,589
You’re not Gao Qiu

367
0:12:17,589 --> 0:12:20,52
So many times, it’s not about what you can do

368
0:12:20,52 --> 0:12:21,58
By leveraging your strengths

369
0:12:21,58 --> 0:12:23,7
And then somehow leaving others behind

370
0:12:23,7 --> 0:12:25,64
You never thought about being squeezed off the narrow bridge

371
0:12:25,64 --> 0:12:28,52
whether those people really fell down

372
0:12:31,64 --> 0:12:34,2
So, as a diligent student from a small town

373
0:12:34,2 --> 0:12:36,91
as the top learner in your county

374
0:12:36,91 --> 0:12:39,47
you made your way to a big city through hard work

375
0:12:39,47 --> 0:12:41,81
and then you'd find yourself in an even larger and more confusing cycle

376
0:12:41,81 --> 0:12:44,11
because you realize there are so many things

377
0:12:44,11 --> 0:12:44,67
various resources

378
0:12:44,67 --> 0:12:45,47
advantageous resources

379
0:12:45,47 --> 0:12:46,55
You can't get it.

380
0:12:46,55 --> 0:12:47,27
You won't be able to access the advantageous resources.

381
0:12:47,27 --> 0:12:48,8
Earning money will be extremely difficult for you.

382
0:12:48,8 --> 0:12:50,84
You'll find that what you know

383
0:12:50,84 --> 0:12:53,44
is still less compared to children from urban areas.

384
0:12:53,44 --> 0:12:55,78
So you must catch up in sociology.

385
0:12:55,78 --> 0:12:57,34
You have to show respect to others.

386
0:12:57,34 --> 0:12:59,87
Humbly accept opinions that differ from yours.

387
0:12:59,87 --> 0:13:1,67
Especially as you get older.

388
0:13:1,67 --> 0:13:3,19
One has already taken a wrong turn.

389
0:13:3,19 --> 0:13:3,95
Wanting to come back is

390
0:13:3,95 --> 0:13:4,71
quite difficult.

391
0:13:4,71 --> 0:13:6,68
So, when it comes to relationships between people,

392
0:13:6,68 --> 0:13:9,69
high self-esteem and high education can be a very critical issue.

393
0:13:9,69 --> 0:13:11,15
High self-esteem,

394
0:13:11,15 --> 0:13:12,97
when paired with high education,

395
0:13:12,97 --> 0:13:14,73
they are two things that can coexist without contradiction.

396
0:13:14,73 --> 0:13:16,54
The stronger a person's self-esteem,

397
0:13:16,54 --> 0:13:18,9
The more he can't hear others' opinions, right?

398
0:13:18,9 --> 0:13:20,2
The stronger a person's self-esteem is,

399
0:13:20,2 --> 0:13:21,66
What he is like now,

400
0:13:21,66 --> 0:13:22,62
What a jerk.

401
0:13:22,62 --> 0:13:23,76
Just a jerk.

402
0:13:23,76 --> 0:13:25,42
He will never change his ways.

403
0:13:25,42 --> 0:13:27,0
That's just how people are.

404
0:13:27,0 --> 0:13:28,84
There are plenty of things you can't stand.

405
0:13:28,84 --> 0:13:30,44
Can you stop me from eating ice cream?

406
0:13:30,44 --> 0:13:34,7
It's not just about being happy.

407
0:13:35,0 --> 0:13:36,7
But the question is, are you happy now?

408
0:13:36,7 --> 0:13:37,48
You're not happy right now.

409
0:13:37,48 --> 0:13:41,89
You still have to endure some systemic exploitation.

410
0:13:41,89 --> 0:13:43,809
Some things established by usage in society.

411
0:13:43,809 --> 0:13:44,949
You've entered the academic circle.

412
0:13:44,949 --> 0:13:47,44
There are certain rules you have to follow.

413
0:13:47,8 --> 0:13:51,17
So do you think staying in that position will definitely be comfortable?

414
0:13:51,17 --> 0:13:53,55
Is getting a government job definitely going to be great?

415
0:13:53,55 --> 0:13:57,13
Is it really the case that entering a large company means you're set for life?

416
0:13:57,13 --> 0:13:58,18
Not at all.

417
0:13:58,18 --> 0:14:0,46
So, from the perspective of comfort,

418
0:14:0,46 --> 0:14:1,2
let me tell you,

419
0:14:1,2 --> 0:14:2,88
starting a business is tough in the beginning,

420
0:14:2,88 --> 0:14:5,26
but once you get on the right track,

421
0:14:5,26 --> 0:14:7,2
this cycle begins,

422
0:14:7,2 --> 0:14:9,94
and basically, you don't have to struggle as much anymore.

423
0:14:11,62 --> 0:14:13,98
So, in reality, it's just a couple of hard years.

424
0:14:13,98 --> 0:14:14,96
A lifetime of happiness

425
0:14:14,96 --> 0:14:16,5
But some people just won't listen

426
0:14:16,5 --> 0:14:18,44
The probability of failure in entrepreneurship is 99%

427
0:14:18,44 --> 0:14:20,54
So you're just going to stick around for your meager pension

428
0:14:20,54 --> 0:14:22,3
Wasting your life in a government job, right?

429
0:14:22,3 --> 0:14:24,3
Wasting your life at a university

430
0:14:24,3 --> 0:14:26,8
Or in some research institute

431
0:14:26,8 --> 0:14:27,38
Or something like that

432
0:14:27,38 --> 0:14:28,82
Of course, you definitely will

433
0:14:28,82 --> 0:14:29,62
Some people come here

434
0:14:29,62 --> 0:14:30,86
specifically for scientific research

435
0:14:30,86 --> 0:14:31,58
to serve the country

436
0:14:31,58 --> 0:14:33,3
and there's nothing wrong with that

437
0:14:33,31 --> 0:14:36,71
but the issue is, many people consider these institutes

438
0:14:36,71 --> 0:14:39,53
not just for the money

439
0:14:39,77 --> 0:14:41,75
if you're working for the money

440
0:14:41,75 --> 0:14:44,71
shouldn't you be more straightforward about your desires?

441
0:14:44,71 --> 0:14:45,569
Right?

442
0:14:45,569 --> 0:14:48,849
Money represents a relationship of free trade.

443
0:14:48,849 --> 0:14:51,529
With money, you have more time to manage your own schedule.

444
0:14:51,529 --> 0:14:52,509
Life,

445
0:14:52,509 --> 0:14:55,249
you have more choices.

446
0:14:55,249 --> 0:14:56,729
Of course, when you have choices,

447
0:14:56,729 --> 0:14:58,369
you might not necessarily spend it.

448
0:14:58,369 --> 0:15:0,86
Of course, some people find joy in spending.

449
0:15:0,86 --> 0:15:1,58
So, no worries.

450
0:15:1,58 --> 0:15:2,82
That's what I want to share with everyone.

451
0:15:2,82 --> 0:15:5,0
If your current situation isn't good

452
0:15:5,0 --> 0:15:6,63
the stronger your self-esteem is

453
0:15:6,63 --> 0:15:8,19
the more you'll struggle

454
0:15:8,19 --> 0:15:10,24
it might be better to have a bit less pride

455
0:15:10,24 --> 0:15:11,72
follow Brother Rong

456
0:15:11,72 --> 0:15:13,76
why not take a step forward

457
0:15:13,76 --> 0:15:15,44
and gain a new perspective

458
0:15:15,44 --> 0:15:17,44
once you've gained new insights

459
0:15:17,44 --> 0:15:18,44
then you can move forward with confidence

460
0:15:18,44 --> 0:15:19,2
It doesn't matter

461
0:15:19,2 --> 0:15:19,48
Right?

462
0:15:19,48 --> 0:15:20,28
You can look down on me again

463
0:15:20,28 --> 0:15:20,76
It's fine

464
0:15:20,76 --> 0:15:22,4
After you get used to the original work

465
0:15:22,4 --> 0:15:24,3
After you see what books I've read

466
0:15:24,3 --> 0:15:25,15
You can look down on me again

467
0:15:25,15 --> 0:15:26,13
That's perfectly fine

468
0:15:26,13 --> 0:15:27,66
Because by then you'll be above me

469
0:15:27,66 --> 0:15:30,2
You have no idea about the things I know.

470
0:15:30,2 --> 0:15:31,18
Then you look down on me.

471
0:15:31,18 --> 0:15:32,62
Then you block me.

472
0:15:32,62 --> 0:15:34,65
Labeling me as someone who spreads false doctrines.

473
0:15:34,65 --> 0:15:37,21
This has cast a shadow over your own life.

474
0:15:37,21 --> 0:15:37,65
How should I put it?

475
0:15:37,65 --> 0:15:40,349
The fog effect doesn't mean I'm in the fog.

476
0:15:40,349 --> 0:15:42,209
I've already walked out of the mist.

477
0:15:42,209 --> 0:15:43,689
I've found my own path.

478
0:15:43,689 --> 0:15:45,269
Found your location

479
0:15:45,269 --> 0:15:46,369
You don’t have it

480
0:15:46,369 --> 0:15:48,305
So that’s how it is

481
0:15:48,929 --> 0:15:52,49
So who is currently in the mud

482
0:15:52,49 --> 0:15:53,729
Who should be worried

483
0:15:56,1 --> 0:15:59,3
Your children read 150 pages every day

484
0:16:0,4 --> 0:16:2,32
Do you think you can become a knowledge influencer in the future

485
0:16:2,32 --> 0:16:3,88
Why don’t you give it a try

486
0:16:3,88 --> 0:16:6,89
See if your follower count will grow

487
0:16:6,89 --> 0:16:7,849
This is just a case of being proven wrong.

488
0:16:7,849 --> 0:16:8,689
If you have a large number of followers,

489
0:16:8,689 --> 0:16:10,609
then what I said would all be a waste of time.

490
0:16:10,609 --> 0:16:12,25
If your follower count isn't high enough,

491
0:16:12,25 --> 0:16:14,67
then what you're doing is just a waste of time.

492
0:16:14,67 --> 0:16:15,33
So, to put it simply,

493
0:16:15,33 --> 0:16:17,72
sometimes that's just how people are.

494
0:16:17,72 --> 0:16:20,0
You might have the key to how others should proceed,

495
0:16:20,0 --> 0:16:22,12
a crucial key.

496
0:16:24,14 --> 0:16:26,46
And people often don't know what to do.

497
0:16:28,7 --> 0:16:29,51
Like me,

498
0:16:29,51 --> 0:16:31,99
I often wonder when my followers will reach a million.

499
0:16:31,99 --> 0:16:33,61
Do I need to start doing something more creative?

500
0:16:33,61 --> 0:16:34,59
Should I start making short dramas?

501
0:16:34,59 --> 0:16:35,7
Or something like that.

502
0:16:35,7 --> 0:16:36,71
But later, I realized it's not like that.

503
0:16:36,71 --> 0:16:38,59
Perhaps that's just the way life is.

504
0:16:38,59 --> 0:16:41,29
It's the cumulative effect of one period after another.

505
0:16:41,29 --> 0:16:44,25
So don't belittle the effort you're putting in now.

506
0:16:44,25 --> 0:16:47,97
And what you're doing is valuable to others,

507
0:16:47,97 --> 0:16:49,29
It's not about how much money you make,

508
0:16:49,29 --> 0:16:50,33
or how many followers you gain.

509
0:16:50,33 --> 0:16:53,26
It's about whether what you do is useful to others.

510
0:16:53,7 --> 0:16:55,54
If more people get stuck,

511
0:16:55,54 --> 0:16:56,78
given the current situation,

512
0:16:56,78 --> 0:16:58,6
you need to figure out a way

513
0:16:58,6 --> 0:17:0,77
to steer them in the right direction.

514
0:17:0,77 --> 0:17:1,45
It's insurmountable

515
0:17:1,45 --> 0:17:3,75
So there's a great responsibility involved

516
0:17:3,75 --> 0:17:5,32
So in many cases

517
0:17:5,32 --> 0:17:7,68
Some of my content is specifically for my followers

518
0:17:7,68 --> 0:17:9,22
Specifically for them to listen to

519
0:17:9,22 --> 0:17:11,2
And for those who aren't followers

520
0:17:11,2 --> 0:17:12,44
It might not be very useful

521
0:17:12,44 --> 0:17:15,16
So adjusting one's self-esteem is particularly important

522
0:17:15,16 --> 0:17:16,56
Look, self-esteem and such

523
0:17:16,56 --> 0:17:18,27
I've actually talked about this in countless episodes.

524
0:17:18,27 --> 0:17:20,91
I think I need to bring it up from time to time.

525
0:17:20,91 --> 0:17:21,99
Feeling moved by yourself is useless.

526
0:17:21,99 --> 0:17:24,61
It’s no good even if you feel moved to tears.

527
0:17:24,61 --> 0:17:26,9
Facing the reality of society,

528
0:17:26,9 --> 0:17:27,69
you must always consider what others are thinking.

529
0:17:27,69 --> 0:17:28,81
What their needs are.

530
0:17:28,81 --> 0:17:30,429
Everything should be centered around others.

531
0:17:30,429 --> 0:17:33,169
You can't be too self-centered when dealing with people.

532
0:17:33,169 --> 0:17:34,489
It's okay to be a bit narcissistic

533
0:17:34,489 --> 0:17:35,489
It's okay to be a bit

534
0:17:35,489 --> 0:17:37,199
a bit more confident is fine

535
0:17:37,199 --> 0:17:40,35
This is when you're adjusting your work state

536
0:17:40,35 --> 0:17:42,33
But when you're working on a product

537
0:17:42,33 --> 0:17:43,47
or a service

538
0:17:43,47 --> 0:17:45,7
when you're facing the public

539
0:17:45,7 --> 0:17:45,95
when you're addressing students

540
0:17:45,95 --> 0:17:46,73
or an audience

541
0:17:46,73 --> 0:17:46,87
Facing

542
0:17:46,87 --> 0:17:48,4
Facing your followers

543
0:17:48,4 --> 0:17:50,2
When facing your cinephiles

544
0:17:50,2 --> 0:17:52,83
It’s crucial to understand what they need

545
0:17:52,83 --> 0:17:56,88
Because we are in the high-end public service industry

546
0:17:56,88 --> 0:17:58,88
Communication studies has this characteristic

547
0:17:58,88 --> 0:18:0,9
If you’re hungry and don’t know to eat

548
0:18:0,9 --> 0:18:1,8
Thirsty and don’t know to drink

549
0:18:1,8 --> 0:18:2,68
You will die

550
0:18:2,68 --> 0:18:3,469
Right or wrong

551
0:18:3,469 --> 0:18:6,389
So at this point, what do you need now?

552
0:18:6,389 --> 0:18:8,949
What you need now is the support and recognition of the public.

553
0:18:8,949 --> 0:18:12,6
You need to create more resources that the public will enjoy.

554
0:18:12,6 --> 0:18:14,4
Just reading books on your own

555
0:18:14,4 --> 0:18:15,48
You wouldn't know exactly which books to read.

556
0:18:15,48 --> 0:18:17,4
Like me, I often read books on business management.

557
0:18:17,4 --> 0:18:18,4
I've been reading for a long time.

558
0:18:18,4 --> 0:18:19,92
Because my interest lies there.

559
0:18:19,92 --> 0:18:22,12
I tend to read for extended periods during critical times

560
0:18:22,12 --> 0:18:23,52
Sometimes I would isolate myself

561
0:18:23,52 --> 0:18:26,89
And spend ten to twenty days completing a 100,000-word book

562
0:18:26,89 --> 0:18:27,37
Right?

563
0:18:27,37 --> 0:18:29,469
Sometimes it might only take six or seven days to finish

564
0:18:29,469 --> 0:18:31,349
The question is whether I need to

565
0:18:31,349 --> 0:18:34,5
It's not about being persistent to achieve something

566
0:18:34,5 --> 0:18:35,29
You haven't even started your journey

567
0:18:35,29 --> 0:18:36,19
All at once

568
0:18:36,19 --> 0:18:38,75
How can you be so sure about reading 150 pages?

569
0:18:38,75 --> 0:18:40,53
Persist for a few years and you’re bound to succeed.

570
0:18:40,53 --> 0:18:42,75
Now, apart from your kids,

571
0:18:42,75 --> 0:18:43,75
You’ve been neglecting your family.

572
0:18:43,75 --> 0:18:45,33
And you haven’t earned much money either.

573
0:18:45,33 --> 0:18:46,95
But your self-esteem has gone up.

574
0:18:46,95 --> 0:18:47,87
You feel pretty good about yourself.

575
0:18:47,87 --> 0:18:48,83
What about my life?

576
0:18:48,83 --> 0:18:51,429
I tell everyone how many books I’ve read in my life.

577
0:18:51,429 --> 0:18:54,89
What’s the point? I graduated from a prestigious university.

578
0:18:54,89 --> 0:18:56,9
I was the top scorer in the college entrance exam when I was young.

579
0:18:56,9 --> 0:18:56,889
How about me?

580
0:18:56,889 --> 0:18:59,57
Have you seen Lei Jun mention his top exam score?

581
0:18:59,57 --> 0:19:0,55
I don’t think so.

582
0:19:0,55 --> 0:19:0,97
Right?

583
0:19:0,97 --> 0:19:2,77
Because you don’t have anything new.

584
0:19:2,77 --> 0:19:5,27
You don’t have any new achievements to boast about.

585
0:19:5,27 --> 0:19:7,49
That’s why you keep reminiscing about the old days.

586
0:19:7,49 --> 0:19:8,21
Back in the day, how things were

587
0:19:8,21 --> 0:19:10,81
Back in the day, I was the campus queen, yeah

588
0:19:11,609 --> 0:19:14,169
Back in the day, your family was well-off, right?

589
0:19:14,169 --> 0:19:15,529
During the Qing Dynasty

590
0:19:17,329 --> 0:19:19,44
What's the point of talking about those things?

591
0:19:19,68 --> 0:19:20,76
Don't you feel embarrassed?

592
0:19:21,92 --> 0:19:25,17
So, a lot of the time, when we talk about being a person

593
0:19:25,17 --> 0:19:26,91
Looking quite old

594
0:19:26,91 --> 0:19:28,57
Many people, in fact, never really grow up

595
0:19:28,57 --> 0:19:30,83
Many people's minds are still quite immature.

596
0:19:30,83 --> 0:19:31,53
His belongings.

597
0:19:31,53 --> 0:19:32,59
His resilience.

598
0:19:32,59 --> 0:19:35,41
The degree of distortion in his mind has become quite severe.

599
0:19:35,41 --> 0:19:38,34
So as he got a bit older,

600
0:19:38,34 --> 0:19:39,68
he wouldn’t listen to advice.

601
0:19:39,68 --> 0:19:41,78
Actually, he’s almost 40 years old.

602
0:19:41,78 --> 0:19:42,62
And then at 50,

603
0:19:42,62 --> 0:19:43,5
and again at 60.

604
0:19:43,5 --> 0:19:45,83
Then you'll be completely phased out by society.

605
0:19:45,83 --> 0:19:49,43
So the most crucial thing is to stay aligned with the channels of social development.

606
0:19:49,43 --> 0:19:52,54
Look at what the mainstream population needs now.

607
0:19:52,54 --> 0:19:56,98
What you offer must be relevant to the mainstream audience.

608
0:19:56,98 --> 0:19:58,86
It shouldn't be overly specialized content.

609
0:19:58,86 --> 0:20:1,4
It should have a certain universal appeal.

610
0:20:1,4 --> 0:20:4,5
Something within the general public's interest that's worth sharing.

611
0:20:4,5 --> 0:20:6,88
Like the videos that went viral on Douyin for me,

612
0:20:6,88 --> 0:20:9,82
Mostly they have some topical elements to them.

613
0:20:9,82 --> 0:20:12,35
Things that are related to this viewer

614
0:20:12,35 --> 0:20:14,59
Things that align with the viewer's interests

615
0:20:14,59 --> 0:20:16,27
Things that meet the viewer's needs

616
0:20:16,27 --> 0:20:18,15
You need to have the audience in mind

617
0:20:18,15 --> 0:20:20,28
If you're creating a show

618
0:20:20,28 --> 0:20:23,86
If you acknowledge that what you're creating is a product

619
0:20:23,86 --> 0:20:25,83
The consumer is the one paying

620
0:20:25,83 --> 0:20:27,65
What the consumer likes and such

621
0:20:27,65 --> 0:20:30,67
You can't tell what they truly need from their comments

622
0:20:30,67 --> 0:20:32,3
You need to start by digging in

623
0:20:32,3 --> 0:20:33,29
You should give it a try

624
0:20:33,29 --> 0:20:35,37
When your self-esteem is very strong

625
0:20:35,37 --> 0:20:38,43
This is where many UPloaders fall short, not even reaching half of what I do

626
0:20:38,43 --> 0:20:39,77
They haven’t really thought about it

627
0:20:39,77 --> 0:20:42,25
Oh, like Rongzheng, he can just open his mouth and speak

628
0:20:42,25 --> 0:20:47,69
And then there’s the one who dresses in tattered clothes, you know what kind of image that is

629
0:20:47,69 --> 0:20:49,1
Coming out without any makeup

630
0:20:50,1 --> 0:20:51,52
Not even memorizing their lines

631
0:20:51,72 --> 0:20:53,22
He didn't even have a teleprompter.

632
0:20:53,22 --> 0:20:55,1
But he still dared to speak like that.

633
0:20:55,1 --> 0:20:56,92
What if he got it wrong?

634
0:20:56,92 --> 0:20:58,58
He doesn't even separate his friend circles.

635
0:20:58,58 --> 0:21:2,44
The things you don't understand are actually my strengths.

636
0:21:2,44 --> 0:21:3,68
The more I talk, the better I know what people like to hear.

637
0:21:3,68 --> 0:21:6,0
Naturally, I know what everyone likes to listen to.

638
0:21:6,0 --> 0:21:7,2
The more I practice, the better I get.

639
0:21:7,2 --> 0:21:8,8
I check the view count.

640
0:21:8,8 --> 0:21:9,24
I look at the audience trends

641
0:21:9,24 --> 0:21:10,12
I check the bounce rate

642
0:21:10,12 --> 0:21:10,96
I look at the completion rate

643
0:21:10,96 --> 0:21:14,1
I naturally know what everyone really wants

644
0:21:14,34 --> 0:21:15,54
I don’t use scripts

645
0:21:15,54 --> 0:21:16,82
So I don’t have to write copy

646
0:21:16,82 --> 0:21:17,86
Writing copy and then doing it

647
0:21:17,86 --> 0:21:19,88
You might update once a week or once a month

648
0:21:19,88 --> 0:21:21,72
I update seven times a week

649
0:21:21,72 --> 0:21:22,46
Episode 14

650
0:21:22,46 --> 0:21:23,44
Can you match me?

651
0:21:23,44 --> 0:21:26,97
You can't even match my combat experience, no matter how many times more you have.

652
0:21:27,29 --> 0:21:29,53
And the most important thing is that I don't care about face.

653
0:21:29,53 --> 0:21:31,11
Chinese people care a lot about face.

654
0:21:31,11 --> 0:21:32,21
I don't care about face.

655
0:21:32,21 --> 0:21:35,11
In this aspect, I will be stronger than anyone else.

656
0:21:35,11 --> 0:21:37,23
Because my cost of trying is low.

657
0:21:37,23 --> 0:21:39,87
So you must have something that makes you stronger than others.

658
0:21:39,87 --> 0:21:41,87
You might be able to stand your ground in the world.

659
0:21:41,87 --> 0:21:43,59
You can't even handle throwing weapons.

660
0:21:43,59 --> 0:21:44,43
Your lightness kung fu is no good either.

661
0:21:44,43 --> 0:21:45,71
Neither is your hard qigong.

662
0:21:45,71 --> 0:21:46,79
Walking on walls and leaping over eaves is beyond you too.

663
0:21:46,79 --> 0:21:47,55
You can't wield swords or knives.

664
0:21:47,55 --> 0:21:48,35
Not even guns or cannons are your forte.

665
0:21:48,35 --> 0:21:49,11
You're no good at anything.

666
0:21:49,11 --> 0:21:50,91
Then what makes you think you can survive in this world?

667
0:21:50,91 --> 0:21:51,73
Right?

668
0:21:51,73 --> 0:21:54,89
So when you talk a lot, there are some things you should listen to.

669
0:21:54,89 --> 0:21:56,45
Especially when I often share practical advice.

670
0:21:56,45 --> 0:21:58,179
Because I don’t talk about fluff.

671
0:21:58,179 --> 0:21:59,179
There’s a lot of substance to cover.

672
0:21:59,179 --> 0:22:0,739
I also want to explore this through.

673
0:22:0,739 --> 0:22:5,12
Artificial intelligence, like DeepSeek, to see if it can help.

674
0:22:5,12 --> 0:22:5,76
Help me explain it.

675
0:22:5,76 --> 0:22:6,36
But the issue is

676
0:22:6,36 --> 0:22:8,86
DeepSeek can only provide some general outlines.

677
0:22:8,86 --> 0:22:10,14
He can elaborate more on certain aspects,

678
0:22:10,14 --> 0:22:11,1
but he can't go into specifics.

679
0:22:11,1 --> 0:22:14,53
He tends to speak in more general terms.

680
0:22:14,53 --> 0:22:17,33
So, he can't offer you specific, personalized guidance.

681
0:22:17,33 --> 0:22:19,93
That's why you can't rely solely on AI tools.

682
0:22:19,93 --> 0:22:23,769
Otherwise, you'll end up being too general.

683
0:22:23,769 --> 0:22:26,69
Too mainstream.

684
0:22:26,69 --> 0:22:27,88
Oh, very mainstream.

685
0:22:27,88 --> 0:22:30,34
It doesn't differ much from the general perception.

686
0:22:30,34 --> 0:22:32,78
You don't have any standout qualities.

687
0:22:32,78 --> 0:22:35,12
Gradually, you'll rely more on AI tools.

688
0:22:35,12 --> 0:22:37,36
In essence, you'll just become a conduit.

689
0:22:37,36 --> 0:22:39,92
Why not just create a digital avatar then?

690
0:22:39,92 --> 0:22:42,7
Why bother trying to be unique?

691
0:22:42,7 --> 0:22:45,13
So, making a show and learning are two different things.

692
0:22:45,13 --> 0:22:48,3
Being a knowledge influencer, creating shows, or teaching courses is great.

693
0:22:48,3 --> 0:22:49,31
Or even selling courses.

694
0:22:49,31 --> 0:22:50,31
Selling books

695
0:22:50,31 --> 0:22:51,9
Selling courses

696
0:22:51,9 --> 0:22:51,63
Selling books

697
0:22:51,63 --> 0:22:52,49
Selling products

698
0:22:52,49 --> 0:22:53,77
Selling services

699
0:22:53,77 --> 0:22:55,43
You need to have your audience in mind

700
0:22:55,43 --> 0:22:56,159
Have your viewers in mind

701
0:22:56,159 --> 0:22:57,399
What the audience loves to watch

702
0:22:57,399 --> 0:22:58,979
What the audience truly cares about

703
0:22:58,979 --> 0:23:0,399
He would then take the time to watch it.

704
0:23:0,399 --> 0:23:2,99
He would then be willing to spend real money on it.

705
0:23:2,99 --> 0:23:4,73
These things are crucial.

706
0:23:4,73 --> 0:23:6,1
Keep the reader in mind.

707
0:23:6,1 --> 0:23:7,71
Keep the audience in mind.

708
0:23:7,71 --> 0:23:9,21
So you need to do this.

709
0:23:9,21 --> 0:23:11,27
You have to be like Chen Peisi.

710
0:23:11,27 --> 0:23:12,67
Like Zheng Yuanyuan.

711
0:23:12,67 --> 0:23:14,62
These two masters.

712
0:23:14,62 --> 0:23:16,32
A role model of our time

713
0:23:16,32 --> 0:23:18,42
Like writing Chuk Betta

714
0:23:18,42 --> 0:23:19,86
How do you say that

715
0:23:19,86 --> 0:23:22,63
What was the name of that sketch again

716
0:23:22,63 --> 0:23:23,9
Right

717
0:23:23,9 --> 0:23:25,27
It's like the sketch with Zhao Benshan and Zhu Shimao

718
0:23:25,27 --> 0:23:26,83
You need a lead and a supporting role

719
0:23:26,83 --> 0:23:29,21
You must respect the rules of art

720
0:23:29,21 --> 0:23:31,27
So you just read 150 pages a day

721
0:23:31,27 --> 0:23:33,2
What's the point of reading 750 pages a day?

722
0:23:33,2 --> 0:23:34,36
Now we have AI,

723
0:23:34,36 --> 0:23:36,16
everyone can read seven or eight hundred pages a day.

724
0:23:36,16 --> 0:23:36,88
There's no issue with that.

725
0:23:36,88 --> 0:23:37,2
Right?

726
0:23:37,2 --> 0:23:38,4
What does this book talk about?

727
0:23:38,4 --> 0:23:40,29
Highlight the key points for me.

728
0:23:40,29 --> 0:23:41,57
You'll know right away.

729
0:23:41,57 --> 0:23:44,51
But the joy of reading is something you have to experience yourself.

730
0:23:44,51 --> 0:23:46,5
So, a lot of things are counterintuitive.

731
0:23:46,5 --> 0:23:47,17
They defy common sense.

732
0:23:47,17 --> 0:23:49,55
Many things go against human nature.

733
0:23:49,55 --> 0:23:52,5
Often, you have to think deeply about them.

734
0:23:52,5 --> 0:23:53,79
Why do I often enjoy reading business books?

735
0:23:53,79 --> 0:23:55,39
Why do I prefer American authors?

736
0:23:55,39 --> 0:23:56,55
It’s not because I worship foreign things.

737
0:23:56,55 --> 0:23:59,71
It’s that American writing tends to be more casual.

738
0:23:59,71 --> 0:24:1,29
Unlike the more formal style in Chinese writing.

739
0:24:1,29 --> 0:24:2,9
Chapter One, Section One

740
0:24:2,9 --> 0:24:2,93
Chapter One, Section Two

741
0:24:2,93 --> 0:24:5,39
Chinese people are particularly afraid of losing face

742
0:24:5,39 --> 0:24:6,3
losing face

743
0:24:6,3 --> 0:24:7,42
Americans don't care

744
0:24:7,42 --> 0:24:8,68
Americans are really amusing

745
0:24:8,68 --> 0:24:10,34
very casual and spontaneous

746
0:24:10,34 --> 0:24:12,62
they write down whatever comes to mind

747
0:24:12,62 --> 0:24:13,84
driven by interest

748
0:24:13,84 --> 0:24:15,32
Chinese people are particularly afraid of writing.

749
0:24:15,32 --> 0:24:16,26
Oh!

750
0:24:16,58 --> 0:24:18,6
I can't let others look down on me.

751
0:24:20,84 --> 0:24:23,32
So, everything I do,

752
0:24:23,32 --> 0:24:26,8
is aimed at the common mistakes Chinese people make,

753
0:24:26,8 --> 0:24:28,58
targeting these weaknesses.

754
0:24:28,58 --> 0:24:29,4
Some people say,

755
0:24:29,4 --> 0:24:31,4
sycophants think foreigners are great,

756
0:24:31,4 --> 0:24:33,86
but we are about learning from each other's strengths to make up for our weaknesses.

757
0:24:33,86 --> 0:24:36,8
Learn from others' strengths

758
0:24:36,8 --> 0:24:36,96
Their weaknesses

759
0:24:36,96 --> 0:24:37,98
Why should we emulate them?

760
0:24:37,98 --> 0:24:38,52
Right?

761
0:24:38,52 --> 0:24:39,36
They're all over the place

762
0:24:39,36 --> 0:24:40,94
Focusing on such things all day

763
0:24:40,94 --> 0:24:41,76
Why should we follow suit?

764
0:24:41,76 --> 0:24:42,48
There's no need to learn from them

765
0:24:42,48 --> 0:24:43,28
Agreed?

766
0:24:43,28 --> 0:24:46,54
Our shortcomings are what hold us back.

767
0:24:46,54 --> 0:24:48,3
For instance, our small-farmer mentality.

768
0:24:48,3 --> 0:24:49,96
Being too concerned about what others think,

769
0:24:49,96 --> 0:24:52,32
Not being ruthless enough when it comes to certain things,

770
0:24:52,32 --> 0:24:53,14
Caring too much about face.

771
0:24:53,14 --> 0:24:55,52
These things slow us down.

772
0:24:55,52 --> 0:24:57,16
Were our revolutionary martyrs like this?

773
0:24:57,16 --> 0:24:59,63
No, they weren’t.

774
0:24:59,63 --> 0:25:1,71
Throughout the revolutionary process,

775
0:25:1,71 --> 0:25:3,63
Throughout the process of building The New China

776
0:25:3,63 --> 0:25:6,25
we often broke away from feudal traditions

777
0:25:6,25 --> 0:25:8,49
we broke down many established conventions

778
0:25:8,49 --> 0:25:10,35
we weren't so concerned with saving face

779
0:25:10,35 --> 0:25:12,35
we broke some old rules

780
0:25:12,35 --> 0:25:13,83
prejudices and the like

781
0:25:13,83 --> 0:25:14,91
men and women were treated equally

782
0:25:14,91 --> 0:25:16,33
that's how we achieved today's success

783
0:25:16,33 --> 0:25:18,77
that's how we have today's bountiful harvest

784
0:25:19,17 --> 0:25:20,69
In today's new society

785
0:25:20,69 --> 0:25:21,85
So in many cases

786
0:25:21,85 --> 0:25:24,65
We need to learn from different people

787
0:25:24,65 --> 0:25:26,33
We should learn from everyone in the world

788
0:25:26,33 --> 0:25:27,83
Even if someone has a hundred flaws

789
0:25:27,83 --> 0:25:28,67
As long as they have one strength

790
0:25:28,67 --> 0:25:29,75
We should still learn from them

791
0:25:29,75 --> 0:25:31,23
Isn't that how we make it our own?

792
0:25:31,23 --> 0:25:31,84
Right?

793
0:25:31,84 --> 0:25:33,36
Looking at the American PPT

794
0:25:33,36 --> 0:25:34,72
We should focus on our own stuff

795
0:25:34,72 --> 0:25:35,31
Right?

796
0:25:35,31 --> 0:25:36,95
So even if he's not like that

797
0:25:36,95 --> 0:25:38,3
We perceive him as such

798
0:25:38,3 --> 0:25:39,63
There's no harm in learning from it

799
0:25:39,63 --> 0:25:40,12
Isn't that so?

800
0:25:40,12 --> 0:25:41,56
These flaws of ours

801
0:25:41,56 --> 0:25:43,68
Do they cease to exist just because I don't mention them?

802
0:25:43,68 --> 0:25:45,26
Who should the fish head be directed at?

803
0:25:45,26 --> 0:25:46,8
Who is the main host?

804
0:25:46,8 --> 0:25:47,139
Who is the secondary host?

805
0:25:47,139 --> 0:25:49,99
Do you think these things are feudal dregs?

806
0:25:49,99 --> 0:25:52,3
Or should they be something to learn with dedication?

807
0:25:52,3 --> 0:25:53,59
Sometimes, you know,

808
0:25:53,59 --> 0:25:55,5
you have to learn the philosophy of gift-giving.

809
0:25:55,5 --> 0:25:57,159
Because you still have to face this society, right?

810
0:25:57,159 --> 0:25:58,999
But a lot of social psychology,

811
0:25:58,999 --> 0:26:0,39
individual psychology concepts,

812
0:26:0,39 --> 0:26:1,319
you should master if you need to.

813
0:26:1,319 --> 0:26:4,469
If you master what others don’t, aren’t you more capable?

814
0:26:4,469 --> 0:26:5,949
That’s how it is.

815
0:26:5,949 --> 0:26:7,309
So when I say what I do,

816
0:26:7,309 --> 0:26:9,35
do I need a script?

817
0:26:9,59 --> 0:26:12,15
What I do is actually in my heart.

818
0:26:12,15 --> 0:26:15,31
What I do is because of the way I express myself.

819
0:26:15,31 --> 0:26:17,1
That’s just my habit.

820
0:26:17,1 --> 0:26:18,78
It breaks some conventions.

821
0:26:18,78 --> 0:26:19,88
It breaks some norms.

822
0:26:19,88 --> 0:26:21,72
How loud should your voice be?

823
0:26:21,72 --> 0:26:25,5
Your voice should be soothing enough to help others sleep.

824
0:26:25,5 --> 0:26:28,48
So some things should have educational value,

825
0:26:28,48 --> 0:26:30,18
but they should also be entertaining,

826
0:26:30,18 --> 0:26:31,48
and comforting.

827
0:26:31,48 --> 0:26:33,32
That’s the tone of my show.

828
0:26:33,32 --> 0:26:35,47
Everyone’s content is different.

829
0:26:35,47 --> 0:26:38,5
Many people strive for correctness,

830
0:26:38,5 --> 0:26:40,929
many people strive for rich content,

831
0:26:40,929 --> 0:26:42,249
but often,

832
0:26:42,249 --> 0:26:43,209
I eat a bowl of instant noodles,

833
0:26:43,209 --> 0:26:44,449
I wash my feet,

834
0:26:44,449 --> 0:26:47,68
before I sleep, I don’t want to hear anything too complex,

835
0:26:47,68 --> 0:26:50,44
anything that might increase my anxiety.

836
0:26:50,44 --> 0:26:52,8
So you’ve read so many books,

837
0:26:52,8 --> 0:26:53,36
you’ve read so many books,

838
0:26:53,36 --> 0:26:57,5
your goal is to let others know you’ve read a lot of books,

839
0:26:57,5 --> 0:26:58,53
so you’ve read a lot of books,

840
0:26:58,53 --> 0:26:59,89
you have to show off,

841
0:26:59,89 --> 0:27:2,99
you have to make others feel you’re extraordinary,

842
0:27:2,99 --> 0:27:5,51
but how do you make others feel extraordinary?

843
0:27:5,51 --> 0:27:7,55
Unless it’s someone who doesn’t know much,

844
0:27:7,55 --> 0:27:9,31
most people have knowledge,

845
0:27:9,31 --> 0:27:10,91
it’s just that everyone’s knowledge is categorized differently,

846
0:27:10,91 --> 0:27:13,62
so you should make people feel happy first,

847
0:27:13,62 --> 0:27:14,7
feel they’ve gained something,

848
0:27:14,7 --> 0:27:15,78
that’s very important.

849
0:27:15,78 --> 0:27:18,6
So you need to break common knowledge,

850
0:27:18,6 --> 0:27:19,54
not just show off your knowledge,

851
0:27:19,54 --> 0:27:22,0
that’s why many people fail as knowledge bloggers,

852
0:27:22,0 --> 0:27:23,32
fail in commentary content,

853
0:27:23,32 --> 0:27:25,2
the reason is this,

854
0:27:25,2 --> 0:27:28,699
because their content is either too broad or too specific,

855
0:27:28,699 --> 0:27:31,39
or too personalized,

856
0:27:31,39 --> 0:27:32,59
waiting for others to react,

857
0:27:32,59 --> 0:27:34,299
or they just follow others,

858
0:27:34,299 --> 0:27:35,82
without any personal opinion,

859
0:27:35,82 --> 0:27:37,7
turning it into a mere narrative of life,

860
0:27:37,7 --> 0:27:39,66
so what we do isn’t a VLOG,

861
0:27:39,66 --> 0:27:40,98
but commentary,

862
0:27:40,98 --> 0:27:42,19
podcast content,

863
0:27:42,19 --> 0:27:45,83
in short, you need to have a grasp of the overall social opinion,

864
0:27:45,83 --> 0:27:47,67
but you also need to stand out a bit,

865
0:27:47,67 --> 0:27:49,59
follow the mainstream social trends,

866
0:27:49,59 --> 0:27:51,64
yet not be exactly the same,

867
0:27:51,64 --> 0:27:53,22
there must be some breakthroughs,

868
0:27:53,22 --> 0:27:55,64
at the same time, even if it’s critical content,

869
0:27:55,64 --> 0:27:59,6
you need to speak in a normal tone,

870
0:27:59,6 --> 0:28:0,699
in a way that people can accept,

871
0:28:0,699 --> 0:28:2,79
not like it’s some kind of esoteric knowledge,

872
0:28:2,79 --> 0:28:3,999
so this is very important.

873
0:28:3,999 --> 0:28:5,439
Communication studies is specialized in communication studies,

874
0:28:5,439 --> 0:28:8,89
advertising studies is in advertising studies,

875
0:28:8,89 --> 0:28:10,13
journalism is in journalism,

876
0:28:10,13 --> 0:28:11,25
since they are different majors in universities,

877
0:28:11,25 --> 0:28:12,88
it tells you,

878
0:28:12,88 --> 0:28:13,88
you can’t surpass them just by your imagination in a short time,

879
0:28:13,88 --> 0:28:17,54
then what’s the point of having television program producers?

880
0:28:17,54 --> 0:28:20,6
What’s the point of having TV stations?

881
0:28:20,6 --> 0:28:21,16
What’s the point of having TV directors?

882
0:28:21,16 --> 0:28:22,86
What's the role of a TV director?

883
0:28:22,86 --> 0:28:24,1
Then there's no such thing as directing studies

884
0:28:24,1 --> 0:28:26,429
There's not much left of the discipline of broadcasting and anchoring in performance studies.

885
0:28:26,429 --> 0:28:27,689
There's nothing much.

886
0:28:27,689 --> 0:28:28,269
communication studies

887
0:28:28,269 --> 0:28:30,349
Studying journalism doesn't cover new media research.

888
0:28:30,349 --> 0:28:30,669
Is that right?

889
0:28:30,669 --> 0:28:32,8
So you've got it all down, then?

890
0:28:32,8 --> 0:28:34,36
So, if you want to become a knowledge influencer

891
0:28:34,36 --> 0:28:36,12
Is reading 150 pages a day enough?

892
0:28:36,12 --> 0:28:39,28
Isn't it true that swinging the sword 500 times a day helps you forget everything?

893
0:28:39,28 --> 0:28:41,469
It's not that you've been reading too many martial arts novels.

894
0:28:41,469 --> 0:28:44,749
So, if you want to do something, don't hesitate to ask for help.

895
0:28:44,749 --> 0:28:45,669
It's about reaching out to others

896
0:28:45,669 --> 0:28:47,289
Learn from those who do well

897
0:28:47,289 --> 0:28:49,48
This is the way to progress in life.
