0:0:0,38 --> 0:0:1,46
Hi everyone

2
0:0:2,54 --> 0:0:4,84
The intelligentsia are often seen as hypocritical.

3
0:0:4,84 --> 0:0:9,0
especially when it aligns with their own interests

4
0:0:9,0 --> 0:0:14,65
they will wave the banners of freedom, fairness, and justice

5
0:0:14,65 --> 0:0:16,47
to attack others

6
0:0:16,47 --> 0:0:18,3
to criticize others

7
0:0:18,3 --> 0:0:19,58
to accuse others

8
0:0:19,58 --> 0:0:24,6
but once it affects their own vested interests

9
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:27,56
they won't hesitate at all

10
0:0:27,56 --> 0:0:31,52
We must crush and destroy the other side.

11
0:0:31,84 --> 0:0:34,19
Of course, that's not what we mean.

12
0:0:34,19 --> 0:0:35,379
You intelligentsia

13
0:0:35,379 --> 0:0:37,459
Rather, we are the intelligentsia.

14
0:0:37,459 --> 0:0:38,839
And that includes me.

15
0:0:38,839 --> 0:0:40,499
You'll find that in many cases,

16
0:0:40,499 --> 0:0:44,36
people's discrimination, insults, and attacks on others,

17
0:0:44,36 --> 0:0:47,45
seem to have a surface-level reason,

18
0:0:47,45 --> 0:0:49,53
that the other party brought it upon themselves.

19
0:0:49,53 --> 0:0:52,39
It's because the other party did something wrong

20
0:0:52,39 --> 0:0:54,55
that he should never be allowed to redeem himself

21
0:0:54,55 --> 0:0:56,15
I want to bring him down

22
0:0:56,15 --> 0:0:57,67
and step on him with ten thousand feet

23
0:0:57,67 --> 0:1:0,99
so that he can never turn things around

24
0:1:0,99 --> 0:1:3,679
but in reality, there hasn't been a court trial

25
0:1:3,679 --> 0:1:5,339
no cross-examination by a lawyer

26
0:1:5,339 --> 0:1:6,66
no involvement from the prosecutor

27
0:1:6,66 --> 0:1:8,759
and yet you've sentenced him to death

28
0:1:8,759 --> 0:1:10,399
Is this the right way to do it?

29
0:1:10,399 --> 0:1:12,359
But you'll find that in many cases,

30
0:1:12,359 --> 0:1:13,639
when we criticize others,

31
0:1:13,639 --> 0:1:16,25
we ourselves are not much better.

32
0:1:16,25 --> 0:1:18,96
So why does Brother Long keep recommending it to everyone?

33
0:1:18,96 --> 0:1:22,2
read books on Machiavellianism.

34
0:1:22,2 --> 0:1:23,72
It's really fascinating.

35
0:1:23,72 --> 0:1:28,52
Because Machiavellianism views everyone as being untrustworthy,

36
0:1:28,52 --> 0:1:31,71
and indeed, everyone is untrustworthy.

37
0:1:31,71 --> 0:1:35,33
When you stop assuming the worst about everyone,

38
0:1:35,33 --> 0:1:39,8
you can actually start acting like a genuinely good person.

39
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:41,56
When you admit to yourself that you're flawed,

40
0:1:41,56 --> 0:1:43,36
and acknowledge your own bad thoughts,

41
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:45,71
you can truly understand

42
0:1:45,71 --> 0:1:49,63
what's really influencing you.

43
0:1:49,63 --> 0:1:52,92
For example, in Shanghai,

44
0:1:52,92 --> 0:1:54,74
if you feel discriminated against in Shanghai,

45
0:1:54,74 --> 0:1:56,64
what do people say about you?

46
0:1:56,64 --> 0:1:58,18
People will say you

47
0:1:58,18 --> 0:1:59,32
a country bumpkin

48
0:1:59,32 --> 0:2:1,89
Rong from Northern Jiangsu

49
0:2:1,89 --> 0:2:3,51
often searches on Baidu

50
0:2:3,51 --> 0:2:5,39
Do Shanghainese discriminate against Beijingers?

51
0:2:5,39 --> 0:2:8,159
Of course, some answers say yes

52
0:2:8,159 --> 0:2:10,259
some answers say no

53
0:2:10,259 --> 0:2:11,93
and some answers are

54
0:2:11,93 --> 0:2:13,57
as long as your economy is thriving

55
0:2:13,57 --> 0:2:14,65
He doesn't discriminate against you

56
0:2:14,65 --> 0:2:15,39
That's just it

57
0:2:15,39 --> 0:2:17,11
But when it comes to this

58
0:2:17,11 --> 0:2:18,81
Brother Rong put himself in it

59
0:2:18,81 --> 0:2:20,31
Because I'm from Beijing

60
0:2:20,31 --> 0:2:22,23
A noble Beijinger, right?

61
0:2:22,23 --> 0:2:24,63
The treaty of mutual non-discrimination between Beijingers and Shanghainese

62
0:2:24,63 --> 0:2:26,13
The non-aggression pact

63
0:2:26,13 --> 0:2:26,97
There might be something to it

64
0:2:26,97 --> 0:2:28,83
But you need to know

65
0:2:28,83 --> 0:2:30,77
The reason I agreed to

66
0:2:30,77 --> 0:2:32,86
Shanghainese don't discriminate against people from Beijing

67
0:2:32,86 --> 0:2:35,54
But they discriminate against people from other places

68
0:2:35,54 --> 0:2:37,85
Does that mean I condone it?

69
0:2:37,85 --> 0:2:41,59
Ah, so this is where my hypocrisy lies.

70
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:44,37
It means as long as you don't discriminate against me

71
0:2:44,37 --> 0:2:45,7
If you discriminate against others

72
0:2:45,7 --> 0:2:47,76
I don't really care

73
0:2:47,76 --> 0:2:50,76
This is where my hypocrisy lies.

74
0:2:50,76 --> 0:2:52,54
You're a racist.

75
0:2:52,54 --> 0:2:53,94
You're a white racist.

76
0:2:57,159 --> 0:2:58,579
You discriminate against Indians.

77
0:2:58,579 --> 0:2:59,84
You discriminate against Jews.

78
0:2:59,84 --> 0:3:1,22
But you don't discriminate against Chinese people.

79
0:3:1,22 --> 0:3:2,54
You don't discriminate against Asians.

80
0:3:2,54 --> 0:3:3,92
Then I'm okay with you.

81
0:3:3,92 --> 0:3:5,48
I think what you're doing is right.

82
0:3:5,48 --> 0:3:6,96
I won't provoke you.

83
0:3:6,96 --> 0:3:8,2
Sometimes it's just like that.

84
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:10,78
But look at all the people who get attacked online.

85
0:3:10,78 --> 0:3:12,16
Guo Youcai,

86
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:13,26
Jiang Ping,

87
0:3:13,26 --> 0:3:14,76
and Sister Feng,

88
0:3:14,76 --> 0:3:15,94
so many people, ha ha.

89
0:3:15,94 --> 0:3:17,14
Of course, there are many more people.

90
0:3:17,14 --> 0:3:19,1
There's a long list of others.

91
0:3:19,1 --> 0:3:21,36
You'll find that all those who are attacked

92
0:3:21,36 --> 0:3:24,16
without exception, are from the countryside

93
0:3:24,16 --> 0:3:25,58
or, in other words, from impoverished areas

94
0:3:25,58 --> 0:3:27,58
or rural kids

95
0:3:28,5 --> 0:3:29,93
I once said

96
0:3:29,93 --> 0:3:31,21
about this world

97
0:3:31,21 --> 0:3:33,79
if there were an apology system in society

98
0:3:33,79 --> 0:3:35,63
the ones who should be least apologized to

99
0:3:35,63 --> 0:3:38,83
are these rural children

100
0:3:38,83 --> 0:3:40,7
These are the left-behind children.

101
0:3:40,7 --> 0:3:43,45
They are the ones who have paid the highest price in the course of development.

102
0:3:43,45 --> 0:3:45,17
Their parents' generation paid a price.

103
0:3:45,17 --> 0:3:47,11
The children were separated from their parents from a young age.

104
0:3:47,11 --> 0:3:49,76
And as they grew up,

105
0:3:49,76 --> 0:3:50,94
due to a lack of knowledge,

106
0:3:50,94 --> 0:3:51,74
a lack of funds,

107
0:3:51,74 --> 0:3:52,56
and a lack of connections,

108
0:3:52,56 --> 0:3:56,19
they still have to engage in heavy physical labor, unable to break the cycle.

109
0:3:56,19 --> 0:3:59,5
So I think left-behind children are among the most disadvantaged in China.

110
0:3:59,5 --> 0:4:1,17
When I say this,

111
0:4:1,17 --> 0:4:2,85
do I include myself?

112
0:4:2,85 --> 0:4:5,409
When I say this,

113
0:4:5,409 --> 0:4:7,989
where do I place myself?

114
0:4:7,989 --> 0:4:10,409
Actually, I'm somewhat hypocritical,

115
0:4:10,409 --> 0:4:12,1
a bit of a phony.

116
0:4:12,1 --> 0:4:14,87
Everyone, especially the intelligentsia,

117
0:4:14,87 --> 0:4:16,5
You'll find that everyone,

118
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:18,68
Of course, now they're saying Jiang Ping cheated.

119
0:4:18,68 --> 0:4:20,58
Someone deserved it, right?

120
0:4:20,58 --> 0:4:23,84
Was it Guo Youcai who had all his singing muted?

121
0:4:23,84 --> 0:4:25,18
Or was it the auto-tuning?

122
0:4:25,18 --> 0:4:27,5
He hasn't had professional training.

123
0:4:27,33 --> 0:4:29,47
I once, after a few drinks,

124
0:4:29,47 --> 0:4:31,99
This was during a chat with a few of my friends.

125
0:4:31,99 --> 0:4:33,59
who are all in the music industry,

126
0:4:33,59 --> 0:4:35,17
because I used to be in a choir when I was a kid.

127
0:4:35,17 --> 0:4:36,9
They all do music.

128
0:4:36,9 --> 0:4:38,859
Their words are a subtle insult to Guo Youcai.

129
0:4:38,859 --> 0:4:41,519
None of them have had formal professional training.

130
0:4:41,519 --> 0:4:43,5
And none of them have been to school.

131
0:4:44,4 --> 0:4:47,56
And they rely entirely on sound cards to fix their vocals.

132
0:4:47,56 --> 0:4:50,21
I have no idea how this jerk became famous.

133
0:4:50,21 --> 0:4:51,29
Why is that?

134
0:4:51,29 --> 0:4:53,83
Because my friend is a singer.

135
0:4:53,83 --> 0:4:54,93
He really enjoys it.

136
0:4:54,93 --> 0:4:57,41
And he has received professional training.

137
0:4:57,41 --> 0:4:59,45
When he was a kid, his mother spent tens of thousands on him.

138
0:4:59,45 --> 0:5:0,36
She found him a teacher.

139
0:5:0,36 --> 0:5:2,28
When he grew up, he went to the UK.

140
0:5:2,28 --> 0:5:3,44
Then he studied in Germany.

141
0:5:3,44 --> 0:5:6,46
So he definitely has had professional training.

142
0:5:6,46 --> 0:5:8,48
I just don't understand him.

143
0:5:8,48 --> 0:5:9,72
And then I said,

144
0:5:9,72 --> 0:5:12,26
You just envy that he's popular, don't you?

145
0:5:12,26 --> 0:5:13,62
Then he said something

146
0:5:13,62 --> 0:5:14,86
that left me speechless.

147
0:5:14,86 --> 0:5:17,72
He said, 'Didn't you also dislike Wang Baoqiang back then?

148
0:5:17,72 --> 0:5:19,25
I said, 'Yes, that's true.

149
0:5:19,25 --> 0:5:21,27
Wang Baoqiang comes from a humble background,

150
0:5:21,27 --> 0:5:24,11
How did a kid from a village near the Shaolin Temple in Henan end up here?

151
0:5:24,11 --> 0:5:24,71
Isn't that right?

152
0:5:24,71 --> 0:5:26,7
Did he ever study acting?'

153
0:5:26,7 --> 0:5:28,2
Did he attend a film academy?

154
0:5:28,2 --> 0:5:29,36
What kind of qualities does he have?

155
0:5:29,36 --> 0:5:31,3
Is his professional competence really that good?

156
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:34,35
If the audience likes it, it's good. It's good that he's out there.

157
0:5:34,35 --> 0:5:35,97
Mr. Tree's performance is really good.

158
0:5:35,97 --> 0:5:36,789
Right?

159
0:5:36,789 --> 0:5:38,229
It's about whether I like it or not

160
0:5:38,229 --> 0:5:38,989
I respect him.

161
0:5:38,989 --> 0:5:40,469
What does it matter if I don't respect him?

162
0:5:40,469 --> 0:5:42,509
So this is the academic approach.

163
0:5:42,509 --> 0:5:45,83
You mean the other side.

164
0:5:45,83 --> 0:5:47,49
Without professional training.

165
0:5:47,49 --> 0:5:50,67
What you're saying is that I have had professional training.

166
0:5:50,67 --> 0:5:52,51
You think the other side is uneducated.

167
0:5:52,51 --> 0:5:53,69
I went to school.

168
0:5:53,69 --> 0:5:54,23
I am educated.

169
0:5:54,23 --> 0:5:57,23
But actually, this is all about family background.

170
0:5:57,23 --> 0:5:58,99
If someone had the same upbringing as you.

171
0:5:58,99 --> 0:5:59,99
Having a family like yours

172
0:5:59,99 --> 0:6:1,19
With the kind of money you have

173
0:6:1,19 --> 0:6:3,47
They might also be able to receive professional training

174
0:6:3,47 --> 0:6:4,26
Right?

175
0:6:4,26 --> 0:6:5,94
Their foreign language skills aren't good

176
0:6:5,94 --> 0:6:7,26
You deliberately speak English to them

177
0:6:7,26 --> 0:6:9,58
Because you know they can't respond

178
0:6:9,58 --> 0:6:10,94
Just like those shopkeepers in Hong Kong

179
0:6:10,94 --> 0:6:12,7
Knowing they won't be able to answer

180
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:14,2
Can you say it to me?

181
0:6:14,2 --> 0:6:15,1
I can damn well curse at you in English

182
0:6:15,1 --> 0:6:15,94
And in French too

183
0:6:15,94 --> 0:6:16,98
Then in Japanese as well

184
0:6:16,98 --> 0:6:17,84
No matter what

185
0:6:17,84 --> 0:6:18,86
I will definitely curse at you

186
0:6:18,86 --> 0:6:21,6
Are you trying to play this game with me?

187
0:6:21,6 --> 0:6:22,98
You're trying to play this game with me

188
0:6:22,98 --> 0:6:24,34
So this is about adjusting your approach based on the person

189
0:6:24,34 --> 0:6:25,2
It's that simple.

190
0:6:25,2 --> 0:6:26,2
It's all about playing to the crowd.

191
0:6:26,2 --> 0:6:29,289
So we say the intelligentsia can be quite despicable.

192
0:6:29,649 --> 0:6:32,709
And the intelligentsia tend to look down on others quite easily.

193
0:6:32,709 --> 0:6:33,97
Look down on others.

194
0:6:33,97 --> 0:6:35,25
Look down on others.

195
0:6:35,25 --> 0:6:37,21
And they have a bit of power.

196
0:6:37,21 --> 0:6:39,55
One day, they finally gain power.

197
0:6:39,55 --> 0:6:41,37
They will definitely use it.

198
0:6:41,37 --> 0:6:43,78
Is it really necessary to use it?

199
0:6:43,78 --> 0:6:45,2
Going to any lengths

200
0:6:45,2 --> 0:6:48,0
And the intelligentsia's favorite thing to do is to cheat.

201
0:6:48,0 --> 0:6:48,86
Breaking the rules

202
0:6:48,86 --> 0:6:50,909
Look at what Brother Rong says, so much

203
0:6:50,909 --> 0:6:52,249
Talking a thousand, talking ten thousand

204
0:6:52,249 --> 0:6:54,389
Always telling you how to break the rules

205
0:6:54,389 --> 0:6:54,749
How to

206
0:6:54,749 --> 0:6:57,2
It’s all about morality, it’s that simple

207
0:6:57,2 --> 0:6:57,82
So, to put it this way

208
0:6:57,82 --> 0:6:59,9
At the end of the day, I am a member of the intelligentsia.

209
0:6:59,9 --> 0:7:1,71
but I just want to tell everyone

210
0:7:1,71 --> 0:7:3,63
When you are part of the intelligentsia,

211
0:7:3,63 --> 0:7:4,57
it's not a big deal

212
0:7:4,57 --> 0:7:5,59
but you need to be familiar with

213
0:7:5,59 --> 0:7:8,72
you need to understand that our group has its flaws

214
0:7:8,72 --> 0:7:11,84
often, we are unable to empathize with others

215
0:7:11,84 --> 0:7:13,299
you think you are a student

216
0:7:13,299 --> 0:7:15,579
But often, you are also part of the intelligentsia.

217
0:7:15,579 --> 0:7:16,679
An intellectual.

218
0:7:16,679 --> 0:7:18,69
Often, you might find yourself thinking, oh,

219
0:7:18,69 --> 0:7:21,37
you have some inherent prejudices against others,

220
0:7:21,37 --> 0:7:24,71
for example, as Brother Rong said the other day, I've tipped you,

221
0:7:24,71 --> 0:7:26,95
and you didn't give me priority.

222
0:7:26,95 --> 0:7:29,27
This is the limitation of class.

223
0:7:29,27 --> 0:7:30,39
I've tipped you,

224
0:7:30,39 --> 0:7:32,14
and you didn't give me priority.

225
0:7:32,58 --> 0:7:34,7
What's the hidden meaning?

226
0:7:34,7 --> 0:7:35,78
The hidden meaning is,

227
0:7:35,78 --> 0:7:36,86
Look, you don't study properly at all.

228
0:7:36,86 --> 0:7:38,22
So you ended up delivering food, right?

229
0:7:38,22 --> 0:7:42,0
So you see, these things have a deep class character.

230
0:7:42,0 --> 0:7:44,82
Brother Rong always criticizes others,

231
0:7:44,82 --> 0:7:45,8
When criticizing others,

232
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:47,74
He always includes himself too.

233
0:7:47,74 --> 0:7:49,1
He always includes himself.

234
0:7:49,1 --> 0:7:51,2
If you don't include yourself

235
0:7:51,2 --> 0:7:53,58
then you're just attacking others

236
0:7:53,58 --> 0:7:54,6
mocking and criticizing them

237
0:7:54,6 --> 0:7:55,6
and that's fine

238
0:7:55,6 --> 0:7:56,87
it doesn't affect you

239
0:7:56,87 --> 0:7:59,77
when you can truly analyze yourself as well

240
0:7:59,77 --> 0:8:2,7
when you break down your own motives

241
0:8:2,7 --> 0:8:4,15
you can understand the real issue

242
0:8:4,15 --> 0:8:6,83
where the real damage lies

243
0:8:6,83 --> 0:8:9,3
Others can't counterattack you when they speak.

244
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:9,51
What's wrong?

245
0:8:9,51 --> 0:8:11,21
Because you're such a smooth talker.

246
0:8:11,21 --> 0:8:13,24
You know so many languages.

247
0:8:13,24 --> 0:8:14,68
You come from a well-connected family, right?

248
0:8:14,68 --> 0:8:15,76
You have a public reputation.

249
0:8:15,76 --> 0:8:17,8
Others have no choice, do they?

250
0:8:17,8 --> 0:8:17,44
Right?

251
0:8:17,44 --> 0:8:18,789
You have a lot of followers

252
0:8:18,789 --> 0:8:20,909
When others speak, they carry little weight

253
0:8:20,909 --> 0:8:23,85
But do you really think people are just like you?

254
0:8:23,85 --> 0:8:25,17
Sometimes you're not like that

255
0:8:25,17 --> 0:8:26,91
You, with your narcissistic personality like Brother Rong

256
0:8:26,91 --> 0:8:28,46
In many cases

257
0:8:28,46 --> 0:8:30,58
You respond to others' attacks in all sorts of ways

258
0:8:30,58 --> 0:8:31,9
You say they're not capable

259
0:8:31,9 --> 0:8:32,94
You say they're not skilled

260
0:8:32,94 --> 0:8:34,3
You say they're not in the right mental state

261
0:8:34,3 --> 0:8:36,569
But is that really the case with the other party?

262
0:8:36,569 --> 0:8:38,949
So sometimes, we might need to ask ourselves sincerely.

263
0:8:38,949 --> 0:8:40,109
Often, in many cases,

264
0:8:40,109 --> 0:8:43,939
we keep saying in our hearts about people from Shanghai,

265
0:8:43,939 --> 0:8:45,59
looking down on people from the countryside,

266
0:8:45,59 --> 0:8:45,979
looking down on people from other regions,

267
0:8:45,979 --> 0:8:47,39
looking down on people from rural areas,

268
0:8:47,39 --> 0:8:48,8
looking down on people from poorer places,

269
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:51,839
do we ourselves look down on them?

270
0:8:51,839 --> 0:8:54,279
Do we look down on people from the countryside?

271
0:8:54,279 --> 0:8:57,399
Ah, do I only look up to my college classmates?

272
0:8:57,399 --> 0:8:59,61
Do I look down on farmers in the outskirts of Beijing?

273
0:8:59,61 --> 0:9:3,5
Do I look down on those who come from different backgrounds than me?

274
0:9:3,5 --> 0:9:4,93
When others speak English poorly,

275
0:9:4,93 --> 0:9:6,98
Do I not mock them?

276
0:9:6,98 --> 0:9:8,66
How often do I mock others?

277
0:9:8,66 --> 0:9:10,23
Many times, it's exactly like this.

278
0:9:10,23 --> 0:9:13,3
Many times, once you criticize someone,

279
0:9:13,3 --> 0:9:13,95
Take a moment to think about it.

280
0:9:13,95 --> 0:9:15,79
When you point a finger at someone else,

281
0:9:15,79 --> 0:9:18,61
the other four fingers point back at you.

282
0:9:18,77 --> 0:9:20,39
Sometimes you need to reflect on whether

283
0:9:20,39 --> 0:9:22,49
you might be criticizing others

284
0:9:22,49 --> 0:9:23,94
while being hypocritical yourself.

285
0:9:23,94 --> 0:9:26,34
My intense hatred for Fengjie

286
0:9:26,34 --> 0:9:28,14
isn't just because he got American citizenship,

287
0:9:28,14 --> 0:9:29,69
couldn't I get American citizenship too?

288
0:9:29,69 --> 0:9:32,7
I hate Guo Youcai so much

289
0:9:32,7 --> 0:9:33,53
I dislike him so much

290
0:9:33,53 --> 0:9:35,83
and I criticize Wang Baoqiang so harshly

291
0:9:35,83 --> 0:9:37,66
seeing him being cheated on

292
0:9:37,66 --> 0:9:38,88
and wearing the green hat

293
0:9:38,88 --> 0:9:39,98
makes me so happy

294
0:9:39,98 --> 0:9:44,24
isn't it just because of jealousy towards others' talents and achievements?

295
0:9:44,24 --> 0:9:47,0
so many people bully Guo Degang

296
0:9:47,0 --> 0:9:48,56
saying this and that about Guo Degang

297
0:9:48,56 --> 0:9:50,8
Of course, public opinion is different now.

298
0:9:50,8 --> 0:9:51,64
They criticize or even insult Cao Yunjin,

299
0:9:51,64 --> 0:9:53,52
or various other crosstalk performers.

300
0:9:53,52 --> 0:9:55,92
But when he himself faces such situations,

301
0:9:55,92 --> 0:9:57,6
he can empathize with Cao Yunjin.

302
0:9:57,6 --> 0:10:1,5
It's only when he himself encounters such issues that people speak up.

303
0:10:1,5 --> 0:10:2,82
Others come from humble beginnings,

304
0:10:2,82 --> 0:10:4,14
and if he is part of the crosstalk community,

305
0:10:4,14 --> 0:10:5,28
he also dislikes Guo Degang.

306
0:10:5,28 --> 0:10:6,81
So that's how it is

307
0:10:6,81 --> 0:10:8,25
When you dislike something or not

308
0:10:8,25 --> 0:10:10,1
It's related to your personal interests

309
0:10:10,1 --> 0:10:11,21
It's related to your field of expertise

310
0:10:11,21 --> 0:10:12,73
I don't hate Guo Youcai that much

311
0:10:12,73 --> 0:10:14,41
But the core reason I dislike Wang Baoqiang

312
0:10:14,41 --> 0:10:16,39
Is because I'm not in the music industry

313
0:10:16,39 --> 0:10:17,91
The same goes for those in the art field

314
0:10:17,91 --> 0:10:18,63
Or those in mathematics

315
0:10:18,63 --> 0:10:19,89
Is that how it works?

316
0:10:19,89 --> 0:10:21,85
When someone is not in your field,

317
0:10:21,85 --> 0:10:23,36
whether they are cheating or not,

318
0:10:23,36 --> 0:10:24,64
or whatever they really are,

319
0:10:24,64 --> 0:10:26,0
it's about your attitude towards them.

320
0:10:26,0 --> 0:10:28,16
it's about your attitude when the world is unclear.

321
0:10:28,16 --> 0:10:29,8
your attitude towards them,

322
0:10:29,8 --> 0:10:31,4
can you tolerate someone with a vocational degree?

323
0:10:31,6 --> 0:10:33,82
can you tolerate someone from the countryside?

324
0:10:33,82 --> 0:10:37,51
Can you tolerate a rural person being better than you?

325
0:10:37,51 --> 0:10:38,63
Richer than you?

326
0:10:38,63 --> 0:10:39,45
More famous than you?

327
0:10:39,45 --> 0:10:42,3
When you can't get what you desire,

328
0:10:42,3 --> 0:10:42,71
But others have it,

329
0:10:42,71 --> 0:10:44,38
Wouldn't you feel angry?

330
0:10:44,38 --> 0:10:47,9
So this is the limitation of the intelligentsia.

331
0:10:47,9 --> 0:10:49,88
It often happens this way.

332
0:10:49,88 --> 0:10:52,76
But why do we need to analyze this issue?

333
0:10:52,76 --> 0:10:55,36
In today's Chinese society,

334
0:10:55,36 --> 0:10:57,56
who do you want to make money from?

335
0:10:57,56 --> 0:11:0,16
What are the lives of the underclass like?

336
0:11:0,16 --> 0:11:1,38
The middle class,

337
0:11:1,38 --> 0:11:2,9
What is the intelligentsia like?

338
0:11:2,9 --> 0:11:4,71
what are the lives of the working class like?

339
0:11:4,71 --> 0:11:5,85
the wealthy,

340
0:11:5,85 --> 0:11:7,15
the established interest groups,

341
0:11:7,15 --> 0:11:8,31
what are their lives like?

342
0:11:8,31 --> 0:11:9,67
You need to understand

343
0:11:9,67 --> 0:11:11,52
people from every place

344
0:11:11,52 --> 0:11:13,8
people from every social class

345
0:11:13,8 --> 0:11:14,56
people from every background

346
0:11:14,56 --> 0:11:16,26
what their characteristics are

347
0:11:16,26 --> 0:11:17,62
who is insecure

348
0:11:17,62 --> 0:11:18,78
who is narcissistic

349
0:11:18,78 --> 0:11:19,9
who is arrogant

350
0:11:19,9 --> 0:11:20,92
who is conceited

351
0:11:20,92 --> 0:11:22,98
It must be crystal clear.

352
0:11:22,98 --> 0:11:26,91
There must be a thorough analysis and understanding of human nature.

353
0:11:26,91 --> 0:11:28,69
You can't just say that.

354
0:11:28,69 --> 0:11:29,569
Everything is for the people.

355
0:11:29,569 --> 0:11:30,589
How could I have done that?

356
0:11:30,589 --> 0:11:34,74
Take off those high-sounding whistles.

357
0:11:34,74 --> 0:11:37,34
Take a look at your true thoughts.

358
0:11:37,34 --> 0:11:39,98
Why did you pursue fairness and justice when you were young?

359
0:11:39,98 --> 0:11:41,569
Why don't you pursue them anymore as you grow up?

360
0:11:41,569 --> 0:11:43,569
Because you've earned the right to mate

361
0:11:43,569 --> 0:11:45,129
Because you've acquired property

362
0:11:45,129 --> 0:11:47,2
You have some assets now

363
0:11:47,2 --> 0:11:48,4
You have people to care for

364
0:11:48,4 --> 0:11:49,64
When you were young

365
0:11:49,64 --> 0:11:53,69
People would say you talk about fairness and justice

366
0:11:53,69 --> 0:11:58,68
And then say you hate this and that, right?

367
0:11:58,68 --> 0:12:0,72
You can't get it

368
0:12:0,72 --> 0:12:3,26
So you want to take it, right?

369
0:12:3,26 --> 0:12:5,26
Do you think robbery is justified?

370
0:12:5,26 --> 0:12:6,66
You think robbery is wrong.

371
0:12:6,66 --> 0:12:9,58
But do you need to give yourself a noble reason?

372
0:12:9,58 --> 0:12:10,78
Right?

373
0:12:11,1 --> 0:12:13,18
Otherwise, wouldn't that be illegal, right?

374
0:12:13,18 --> 0:12:14,3
But you're not like that.

375
0:12:14,3 --> 0:12:16,6
You say this is a struggle.

376
0:12:16,6 --> 0:12:16,82
I'm different.

377
0:12:16,82 --> 0:12:18,52
So I have a noble reason.

378
0:12:18,52 --> 0:12:21,2
I have my moments to speak

379
0:12:21,2 --> 0:12:24,64
Everyone must take the time to look into their own hearts

380
0:12:24,64 --> 0:12:28,28
to see what direction our sense of shame points to

381
0:12:28,28 --> 0:12:30,48
When you're condemning others

382
0:12:30,48 --> 0:12:33,36
check if your own arguments hold water

383
0:12:33,36 --> 0:12:35,5
if you're being hypocritical

384
0:12:35,5 --> 0:12:36,93
At this point, when you speak

385
0:12:36,93 --> 0:12:39,85
If you view good and evil as something so simple

386
0:12:39,85 --> 0:12:41,21
that can be easily distinguished

387
0:12:41,21 --> 0:12:43,7
Then your life becomes an idealist's paradise

388
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:46,26
When you truly step into the realm of realism

389
0:12:46,26 --> 0:12:48,46
When you see that everyone has their emotions and desires

390
0:12:48,46 --> 0:12:49,98
When you find that managing people is no easy task

391
0:12:49,98 --> 0:12:52,9
When you truly take on a managerial role

392
0:12:54,21 --> 0:12:57,31
You'll realize that all these people are not easy to handle

393
0:12:57,31 --> 0:12:59,31
All these people based on their backgrounds

394
0:12:59,31 --> 0:13:0,11
Based on their categories

395
0:13:0,11 --> 0:13:1,47
Based on their income levels

396
0:13:1,47 --> 0:13:4,67
You'll find that everyone has their own way of doing things.

397
0:13:4,67 --> 0:13:7,7
Of course, comparing ordinary people to monkeys isn't safe,

398
0:13:7,7 --> 0:13:8,0
nor is it appropriate.

399
0:13:8,0 --> 0:13:9,32
But you must understand,

400
0:13:9,32 --> 0:13:11,72
each social class has its own limitations,

401
0:13:11,72 --> 0:13:13,94
and each class has its own characteristics.

402
0:13:13,94 --> 0:13:15,24
You should also understand,

403
0:13:15,24 --> 0:13:17,52
as a member of society,

404
0:13:17,52 --> 0:13:19,18
you also belong to a certain social class.

405
0:13:19,18 --> 0:13:21,34
You might think you belong to every class.

406
0:13:21,34 --> 0:13:22,46
But that's not the case.

407
0:13:22,46 --> 0:13:24,36
You have the flaws of every class.

408
0:13:24,36 --> 0:13:27,4
Of course, you may have more flaws from certain classes.

409
0:13:27,4 --> 0:13:28,3
However, no matter what,

410
0:13:28,3 --> 0:13:29,92
when you criticize others,

411
0:13:29,92 --> 0:13:31,84
make sure to include yourself.

412
0:13:31,84 --> 0:13:34,8
This way, you won't be a completely evil person.

413
0:13:34,8 --> 0:13:35,77
You'll just be a bit evil.

414
0:13:35,77 --> 0:13:38,53
Of course, many people don't understand why.

415
0:13:38,53 --> 0:13:39,31
I am a good person.

416
0:13:39,31 --> 0:13:40,61
I don’t get the good I deserve.

417
0:13:40,61 --> 0:13:43,2
Are you a good person?

418
0:13:43,34 --> 0:13:44,58
Are you a good person?

419
0:13:44,58 --> 0:13:45,26
Think about it carefully.

420
0:13:45,26 --> 0:13:46,89
Are you a good person?

421
0:13:46,89 --> 0:13:48,53
Do you think you are kind?

422
0:13:48,53 --> 0:13:51,91
Do you think you are harmless?

423
0:13:51,91 --> 0:13:53,45
You don’t bully others.

424
0:13:53,45 --> 0:13:55,28
But that’s not enough to be good.

425
0:13:55,8 --> 0:13:58,32
Would you throw a cat off a building just to cut a paper box?

426
0:13:58,32 --> 0:13:59,0
Right?

427
0:13:59,0 --> 0:14:0,38
Often, that’s how it is.

428
0:14:0,38 --> 0:14:2,62
Would you run over a child because of road rage?

429
0:14:2,62 --> 0:14:4,18
Many times, that’s how it is.

430
0:14:4,18 --> 0:14:7,49
Many times, you think you’re not the one who does evil.

431
0:14:7,49 --> 0:14:8,89
So you think it doesn’t matter.

432
0:14:8,89 --> 0:14:11,15
But if you change your perspective many times,

433
0:14:11,15 --> 0:14:12,89
You might also be the one who does evil.

434
0:14:12,89 --> 0:14:14,15
You can also be the evil person.

435
0:14:14,15 --> 0:14:15,87
So, in many cases,

436
0:14:15,87 --> 0:14:18,73
We say that cultivating the mind and being sincere,

437
0:14:18,73 --> 0:14:22,81
Being good and persistent is never about focusing on others,

438
0:14:22,81 --> 0:14:24,37
But rather focusing on yourself.

439
0:14:24,37 --> 0:14:26,4
What problems do I still have?

440
0:14:26,4 --> 0:14:28,12
Where am I still being insincere?

441
0:14:28,12 --> 0:14:30,66
Where do I still need to discern the truth from the false?

442
0:14:30,66 --> 0:14:32,68
Not pointing fingers at others,

443
0:14:32,68 --> 0:14:34,66
Oh, I need to spread the word,

444
0:14:34,66 --> 0:14:35,18
Oh,

445
0:14:35,18 --> 0:14:36,22
I need to preach,

446
0:14:36,22 --> 0:14:37,26
This world is so what, you know,

447
0:14:37,26 --> 0:14:38,22
I need to release life,

448
0:14:38,22 --> 0:14:39,46
I need to organize a Crusade

449
0:14:39,46 --> 0:14:41,11
I need to kill this and that,

450
0:14:41,11 --> 0:14:43,59
The worst person is actually yourself.

451
0:14:43,59 --> 0:14:46,11
You yourself are the source of all evil in this world.

452
0:14:46,11 --> 0:14:50,11
Of course, to some extent, you allow yourself to forgive yourself.

453
0:14:50,11 --> 0:14:51,32
People are just that hypocritical.

454
0:14:51,32 --> 0:14:53,72
So when you truly commit heinous acts,

455
0:14:53,72 --> 0:14:54,76
You will also forgive yourself,

456
0:14:54,76 --> 0:14:55,76
Let yourself off the hook.

457
0:14:55,76 --> 0:14:56,88
How else would the Japanese live?

458
0:14:56,88 --> 0:14:58,7
So, many times, that’s how it is.

459
0:14:58,7 --> 0:15:1,96
You will always find a justification for your actions,

460
0:15:1,96 --> 0:15:4,44
You will always find faults with the other party,

461
0:15:4,44 --> 0:15:5,62
Find faults with the other party,

462
0:15:5,62 --> 0:15:7,26
So what I want to say now is,

463
0:15:7,26 --> 0:15:11,41
Is it enough to always think you’re a good person?

464
0:15:11,41 --> 0:15:13,69
Many times, you need to put yourself under a microscope,

465
0:15:13,69 --> 0:15:16,72
And see what kind of person you really are.
