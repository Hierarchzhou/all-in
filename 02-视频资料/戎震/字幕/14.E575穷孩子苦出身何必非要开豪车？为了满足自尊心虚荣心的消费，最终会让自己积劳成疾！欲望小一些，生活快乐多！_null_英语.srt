1
0:0:0,52 --> 0:0:3,72
There's a saying that people from smaller places tend to love driving bigger cars.

2
0:0:3,72 --> 0:0:4,2
Hello everyone.

3
0:0:4,2 --> 0:0:5,48
I'm Rong Zhen.

4
0:0:5,48 --> 0:0:8,67
We often say that people have a compensatory mindset.

5
0:0:8,67 --> 0:0:11,43
Why do people go crazy shopping and buy a lot of things?

6
0:0:11,43 --> 0:0:15,15
Why do they buy things they no longer had from their childhood?

7
0:0:15,15 --> 0:0:18,425
It's because they want to compensate for the psychological lack from their childhood.

8
0:0:18,71 --> 0:0:21,31
You all know I bought a small scooter.

9
0:0:21,31 --> 0:0:23,25
And I also got a small car.

10
0:0:23,25 --> 0:0:24,49
It can be called a microcar

11
0:0:24,49 --> 0:0:26,6
specifically, an A00-class microcar

12
0:0:26,6 --> 0:0:29,32
The total cost for this car was 33,600 yuan

13
0:0:29,32 --> 0:0:30,77
We're not including insurance

14
0:0:30,77 --> 0:0:33,45
In the future, when I buy a house

15
0:0:33,45 --> 0:0:35,91
not when I trade in a car

16
0:0:35,91 --> 0:0:37,33
roughly, with the national subsidy

17
0:0:37,33 --> 0:0:38,11
along with other subsidies

18
0:0:38,11 --> 0:0:40,88
the trade-in subsidy can amount to around 30,000 yuan

19
0:0:40,88 --> 0:0:43,61
So basically, this car is practically free.

20
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:46,59
As everyone knows, my motorcycle is in the 10,000 range.

21
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:48,59
Actually, I initially planned to buy a motorcycle for around 6,000.

22
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:51,269
But then I thought, how much difference could there be between 6,000 and 10,000?

23
0:0:51,269 --> 0:0:52,729
It’s mostly in the engine.

24
0:0:52,729 --> 0:0:55,229
So we decided to go with the original Suzuki engine.

25
0:0:55,229 --> 0:0:56,909
This will make future motorcycle trips more convenient.

26
0:0:56,909 --> 0:0:59,44
And the main reason for buying the UI125 is

27
0:0:59,44 --> 0:1:0,92
that it can be fitted with a sub-tank.

28
0:1:0,92 --> 0:1:2,72
Now that I've installed an auxiliary fuel tank,

29
0:1:2,72 --> 0:1:4,68
the car's range has reached 700 kilometers.

30
0:1:4,68 --> 0:1:8,39
My car's range is only 210 kilometers.

31
0:1:8,39 --> 0:1:10,13
It's very easy to turn on the air conditioning,

32
0:1:10,13 --> 0:1:11,39
and the range drops significantly.

33
0:1:11,39 --> 0:1:13,1
After I calculated it,

34
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:15,15
driving about 60 kilometers,

35
0:1:15,15 --> 0:1:17,51
the range can drop by about 100 kilometers.

36
0:1:17,51 --> 0:1:18,55
That's nearly half of it.

37
0:1:18,55 --> 0:1:20,3
Dropped by 105

38
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:23,19
So basically, from the feeling in Beijing

39
0:1:23,19 --> 0:1:24,43
If you need to go out

40
0:1:24,43 --> 0:1:25,47
Even slightly

41
0:1:25,47 --> 0:1:26,63
Like crossing the Fifth Ring Road

42
0:1:26,63 --> 0:1:27,55
The Fourth Ring Road

43
0:1:27,55 --> 0:1:28,6
The Sixth Ring Road

44
0:1:28,6 --> 0:1:31,18
You'd probably need to recharge for a round trip

45
0:1:31,18 --> 0:1:35,28
But it's all good, I sorted out all the parking issues yesterday

46
0:1:35,28 --> 0:1:37,68
Let's also arrange the parking spaces in this residential area.

47
0:1:37,68 --> 0:1:38,74
Just arranged for 23 years.

48
0:1:38,74 --> 0:1:42,37
Then I also set up this roadside parking on Xueyuan South Road.

49
0:1:42,37 --> 0:1:44,85
So, you'll be able to see my car on Xueyuan South Road from now on.

50
0:1:44,85 --> 0:1:47,539
But Xueyuan South Road is really long, you know.

51
0:1:47,539 --> 0:1:49,379
Starting from the fourth intersection on the left of Xuanan South Road.

52
0:1:50,739 --> 0:1:53,859
Both sides of this entire road, north and south, are my parking spots.

53
0:1:53,859 --> 0:1:56,9
So this is a huge advantage.

54
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:59,7
Parking in the city can be quite challenging.

55
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:1,14
But if you park it by the roadside,

56
0:2:1,14 --> 0:2:3,26
they can offer you an annual package,

57
0:2:3,26 --> 0:2:5,42
which is 3,600 for the year,

58
0:2:5,42 --> 0:2:6,4
300 per month,

59
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:7,88
which is quite good.

60
0:2:7,88 --> 0:2:8,84
Anyway,

61
0:2:8,84 --> 0:2:11,89
my current shopping experience is really great.

62
0:2:11,89 --> 0:2:13,29
Why did I suddenly decide to buy a car?

63
0:2:13,29 --> 0:2:15,33
It's because I got the license plate quota in Beijing.

64
0:2:15,33 --> 0:2:16,67
It was on May 28th.

65
0:2:16,67 --> 0:2:20,16
Actually, I need to buy a car before May 28th next year.

66
0:2:20,16 --> 0:2:23,19
But there are so many things to handle next year.

67
0:2:23,19 --> 0:2:26,45
I’ll wait until my passport is renewed next year,

68
0:2:26,45 --> 0:2:27,95
which will be after June.

69
0:2:27,95 --> 0:2:29,93
I might have to go back to Canada,

70
0:2:29,93 --> 0:2:31,15
I might have to go back to Canada,

71
0:2:31,15 --> 0:2:33,309
or if everything goes well,

72
0:2:33,309 --> 0:2:34,989
I might make a trip to Canada.

73
0:2:34,989 --> 0:2:37,309
And I'll be heading to the United States as well.

74
0:2:37,309 --> 0:2:39,47
It will probably take about three or four months.

75
0:2:39,47 --> 0:2:41,15
I won't be staying for too long.

76
0:2:41,15 --> 0:2:42,47
It's for work purposes.

77
0:2:42,47 --> 0:2:43,77
I'll be filming some content over there.

78
0:2:43,77 --> 0:2:45,3
To keep you all updated with new stuff.

79
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:47,43
So when you visit my channel,

80
0:2:47,43 --> 0:2:48,69
There will be more content available.

81
0:2:48,69 --> 0:2:52,33
For the rest of this year, I might focus on learning French.

82
0:2:52,33 --> 0:2:53,97
Hehe, maybe it's about learning French

83
0:2:53,97 --> 0:2:56,9
Then I'll be updating with a few new courses

84
0:2:56,9 --> 0:2:57,33
Basically speaking

85
0:2:57,33 --> 0:3:0,329
The pace is about one update per month

86
0:3:0,329 --> 0:3:2,449
Why have I suddenly become more diligent recently

87
0:3:2,449 --> 0:3:5,269
It's because my work focus has started to shift

88
0:3:5,269 --> 0:3:6,369
Because now

89
0:3:6,369 --> 0:3:9,42
Gradually, I've found that

90
0:3:9,42 --> 0:3:11,6
In recent years, I've been thinking about developing overseas

91
0:3:11,6 --> 0:3:15,92
Actually, I've always planned to develop overseas in a few years.

92
0:3:15,92 --> 0:3:18,9
But now that there's the C11 work visa,

93
0:3:18,9 --> 0:3:20,9
it might happen sooner.

94
0:3:20,9 --> 0:3:21,82
If it happens sooner,

95
0:3:21,82 --> 0:3:23,82
the benefit of this work visa is that

96
0:3:23,82 --> 0:3:28,27
you don't have to stay for a mandatory period to qualify for residency.

97
0:3:28,27 --> 0:3:30,27
You can go and stay for a month if you want to,

98
0:3:30,27 --> 0:3:32,51
or stay for four months if you prefer,

99
0:3:32,51 --> 0:3:34,67
or stay in the country for a year if you choose to.

100
0:3:34,67 --> 0:3:36,51
He doesn’t have too many time constraints.

101
0:3:36,51 --> 0:3:38,1
Just renew the work visa then.

102
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:41,649
So, the immigration step is skipped, right?

103
0:3:41,649 --> 0:3:43,329
Therefore, getting a work visa,

104
0:3:43,329 --> 0:3:46,1
is also a pretty good compromise solution.

105
0:3:46,1 --> 0:3:49,34
At least you know that for this kind of work,

106
0:3:49,34 --> 0:3:51,82
for conducting international business,

107
0:3:51,82 --> 0:3:54,79
there is actually a path you can take.

108
0:3:54,79 --> 0:3:57,99
Without changing your current immigration status.

109
0:3:57,99 --> 0:3:59,599
Without changing your nationality

110
0:3:59,599 --> 0:4:1,28
you just apply for a work visa

111
0:4:1,28 --> 0:4:3,72
just like many foreigners apply for a work visa to come to China

112
0:4:3,72 --> 0:4:4,6
it’s the same principle

113
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:7,53
it’s relatively reciprocal

114
0:4:7,53 --> 0:4:10,87
so, from my perspective

115
0:4:10,87 --> 0:4:12,3
speaking of North America

116
0:4:12,3 --> 0:4:17,379
I feel that Chinese Canadians particularly love driving SUVs

117
0:4:17,379 --> 0:4:19,719
SUVs are so spacious

118
0:4:19,719 --> 0:4:20,679
It can carry cargo

119
0:4:20,679 --> 0:4:21,98
and show off too

120
0:4:21,98 --> 0:4:23,8
In rural areas of America

121
0:4:23,8 --> 0:4:25,58
many people drive pickup trucks

122
0:4:25,58 --> 0:4:27,26
In the colder eastern regions

123
0:4:27,26 --> 0:4:28,14
people also drive pickup trucks

124
0:4:28,14 --> 0:4:31,79
but I feel that driving a pickup is kind of

125
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:32,51
how should I put it

126
0:4:32,51 --> 0:4:34,65
many people just make their vehicles really big

127
0:4:34,65 --> 0:4:35,81
You'll find that

128
0:4:35,81 --> 0:4:39,479
in China, when I picked up my car and drove home the other day

129
0:4:39,479 --> 0:4:41,839
I was driving pretty fast

130
0:4:41,839 --> 0:4:44,399
so other motorcycles started to rev at me

131
0:4:44,399 --> 0:4:46,199
and even some SUVs did the same

132
0:4:46,199 --> 0:4:49,549
I guess they can't stand someone driving faster than them

133
0:4:49,549 --> 0:4:52,789
the main reason was that a small scooter revved at me

134
0:4:52,789 --> 0:4:53,709
which was really frustrating

135
0:4:53,709 --> 0:4:56,569
it's interesting how people's ego works

136
0:4:56,569 --> 0:4:59,529
You'll find that a lot of times, people buy bigger cars

137
0:4:59,529 --> 0:5:0,789
faster cars

138
0:5:0,789 --> 0:5:2,44
larger houses

139
0:5:2,44 --> 0:5:4,12
and it's often vanity that's driving these purchases

140
0:5:4,12 --> 0:5:5,6
So in reality

141
0:5:5,6 --> 0:5:7,44
how much of your life are you really spending on vanity

142
0:5:7,44 --> 0:5:10,74
on self-esteem, really?

143
0:5:10,74 --> 0:5:12,6
When I was in Canada

144
0:5:12,6 --> 0:5:14,88
I felt that many people there really live their lives

145
0:5:14,88 --> 0:5:17,32
Our way of speaking is quite simple and honest.

146
0:5:17,32 --> 0:5:19,75
But I’m just a naive and sweet person.

147
0:5:19,75 --> 0:5:21,95
I haven’t gone through the gauntlet of exam-oriented education.

148
0:5:21,95 --> 0:5:26,23
Nor have I faced the harsh tests of competition in society.

149
0:5:26,23 --> 0:5:28,11
He lives in a way that’s hard to describe,

150
0:5:28,11 --> 0:5:30,19
but in a very natural state.

151
0:5:30,19 --> 0:5:31,11
Look at those foreigners over there.

152
0:5:31,11 --> 0:5:34,5
Most of them drive a beat-up car worth a few thousand dollars,

153
0:5:34,5 --> 0:5:35,49
usually an old Japanese or Korean model.

154
0:5:35,49 --> 0:5:36,74
There are quite a few of them.

155
0:5:36,74 --> 0:5:38,78
It’s actually Chinese people who love buying sports cars.

156
0:5:38,78 --> 0:5:40,84
They love purchasing all sorts of large vehicles.

157
0:5:40,84 --> 0:5:42,88
Mainly because they are in Canada,

158
0:5:42,88 --> 0:5:45,6
especially in Vancouver, where Chinese people are wealthy.

159
0:5:45,6 --> 0:5:49,8
And you’ll notice that Americans really love big cars.

160
0:5:49,8 --> 0:5:50,94
big and noisy,

161
0:5:50,94 --> 0:5:51,82
wasteful,

162
0:5:51,82 --> 0:5:53,32
large displacement vehicles are like that.

163
0:5:53,32 --> 0:5:55,75
Americans are also quite concerned about saving face.

164
0:5:55,75 --> 0:5:56,55
They value their reputation.

165
0:5:56,55 --> 0:5:58,39
They place a lot of emphasis on appearances.

166
0:5:58,39 --> 0:5:59,55
They care about respect.

167
0:5:59,55 --> 0:6:0,83
You have to show me respect.

168
0:6:0,83 --> 0:6:2,7
Otherwise, I'll show you what I'm capable of.

169
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:5,16
It starts like this, you might think it’s because Americans...

170
0:6:5,16 --> 0:6:5,76
To put it bluntly.

171
0:6:5,76 --> 0:6:6,52
Take a look.

172
0:6:6,52 --> 0:6:7,8
You're talking about Brother Rong,

173
0:6:7,8 --> 0:6:9,6
you never diss America in your show.

174
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:10,32
That's not true.

175
0:6:10,32 --> 0:6:12,39
I often make comparisons.

176
0:6:12,71 --> 0:6:15,9
Americans are the vanguards of consumerism.

177
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:17,48
The term 'consumerism',

178
0:6:17,48 --> 0:6:20,46
it originates from the United States.

179
0:6:20,46 --> 0:6:22,4
It's about maxing out credit cards,

180
0:6:22,4 --> 0:6:23,88
and buying things that aren't suitable.

181
0:6:23,88 --> 0:6:26,35
Americans tend to do things like this.

182
0:6:26,35 --> 0:6:28,27
Of course, people from different states in America

183
0:6:28,27 --> 0:6:30,59
have different spending habits.

184
0:6:30,59 --> 0:6:34,35
Some people buy pickup trucks for farm work,

185
0:6:34,35 --> 0:6:35,37
for hauling goods,

186
0:6:35,37 --> 0:6:37,9
or for transporting livestock and such.

187
0:6:37,9 --> 0:6:38,5
It's different, you see.

188
0:6:39,5 --> 0:6:41,7
But look, when it comes to Beijing,

189
0:6:41,7 --> 0:6:42,53
I see many people buying pickup trucks.

190
0:6:42,53 --> 0:6:45,19
I just wonder if it's for work

191
0:6:45,19 --> 0:6:46,3
or for show

192
0:6:46,3 --> 0:6:47,63
And in Beijing, if you buy a pickup truck

193
0:6:47,63 --> 0:6:50,1
you can use a trailer or an RV

194
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:52,6
including a lot of other things with an RV

195
0:6:52,6 --> 0:6:54,44
In reality, I think

196
0:6:54,44 --> 0:6:57,6
we should follow a principle

197
0:6:57,6 --> 0:6:58,6
when you buy something

198
0:6:58,6 --> 0:7:0,78
why would you go for a particularly large engine size

199
0:7:0,78 --> 0:7:3,26
Why do you want to buy such a big car?

200
0:7:3,26 --> 0:7:4,66
I'm getting the Great Wall Cannon.

201
0:7:5,98 --> 0:7:7,34
It's all about face.

202
0:7:7,34 --> 0:7:10,39
It really has a lot to do with face.

203
0:7:10,39 --> 0:7:14,37
But why do you always want to buy something bigger, stronger, and more robust?

204
0:7:14,37 --> 0:7:15,85
Something more solid?

205
0:7:15,85 --> 0:7:17,21
It's because of your inner self.

206
0:7:17,21 --> 0:7:18,49
Your confidence.

207
0:7:18,49 --> 0:7:20,5
Your self-image.

208
0:7:20,5 --> 0:7:22,49
It feels a bit unstable

209
0:7:22,49 --> 0:7:25,1
You need to let others know you're strong

210
0:7:25,1 --> 0:7:26,36
You're very muscular

211
0:7:26,36 --> 0:7:27,68
You're very solid

212
0:7:27,68 --> 0:7:28,82
You can't afford to provoke others

213
0:7:28,82 --> 0:7:29,58
They can't afford to provoke you

214
0:7:29,58 --> 0:7:30,66
They can't afford to provoke you

215
0:7:30,66 --> 0:7:31,24
Do you know that

216
0:7:31,24 --> 0:7:32,59
So that's the feeling

217
0:7:32,59 --> 0:7:34,23
He makes others feel

218
0:7:34,23 --> 0:7:35,7
You little scooter

219
0:7:35,7 --> 0:7:35,87
You dare to challenge me

220
0:7:35,87 --> 0:7:37,99
My car accelerates really fast

221
0:7:37,99 --> 0:7:40,37
It's just that they can't handle this kind of inner

222
0:7:40,37 --> 0:7:41,89
challenge to their self-esteem

223
0:7:41,89 --> 0:7:42,97
even if you're just a bit faster

224
0:7:42,97 --> 0:7:44,15
he has to overtake you

225
0:7:44,15 --> 0:7:45,47
even if he has to switch lanes to do so

226
0:7:45,47 --> 0:7:48,11
Even if it's close to causing an accident, he'll still try to overtake you.

227
0:7:48,11 --> 0:7:50,23
He just has to overtake you.

228
0:7:50,23 --> 0:7:51,19
Even if it's entirely his fault,

229
0:7:51,19 --> 0:7:52,15
He still has to overtake you.

230
0:7:52,15 --> 0:7:53,49
Hehe, it's quite amusing.

231
0:7:53,49 --> 0:7:56,21
You'll find that men are particularly weak in this aspect.

232
0:7:56,21 --> 0:7:58,17
Men are very sensitive about their self-esteem.

233
0:7:58,17 --> 0:8:1,45
When it comes to self-esteem, they just can't let it go.

234
0:8:1,45 --> 0:8:3,41
They have to be better than others in some way.

235
0:8:3,41 --> 0:8:5,53
Of course, look at this peacock.

236
0:8:5,53 --> 0:8:7,64
It's the male peacock displaying its feathers.

237
0:8:7,64 --> 0:8:8,68
What is he trying to do?

238
0:8:8,68 --> 0:8:10,88
This is a delayed form of courtship behavior.

239
0:8:10,88 --> 0:8:13,24
Or we can say it's post-adolescent.

240
0:8:13,24 --> 0:8:16,28
So you'll notice these shopping tendencies.

241
0:8:16,28 --> 0:8:17,88
They are linked to this.

242
0:8:17,88 --> 0:8:20,2
The more unstable your inner core is,

243
0:8:20,2 --> 0:8:23,86
the more you need material things to affirm yourself.

244
0:8:23,86 --> 0:8:25,86
Why do you want to buy a bag?

245
0:8:25,86 --> 0:8:28,2
Why do you want to buy a car with a large engine?

246
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:29,88
Why do you want to buy a big house?

247
0:8:29,88 --> 0:8:33,32
Is it because you feel a severe lack of material things inside?

248
0:8:33,32 --> 0:8:34,38
It dominates your mind.

249
0:8:34,38 --> 0:8:37,64
To put it bluntly, it's because you've experienced poverty.

250
0:8:37,64 --> 0:8:39,32
Because you feel small.

251
0:8:39,32 --> 0:8:40,809
Because you feel particularly insignificant.

252
0:8:40,809 --> 0:8:43,809
And you become almost invisible, like a tiny teapot.

253
0:8:43,809 --> 0:8:46,769
So you have to buy big things to show off yourself

254
0:8:46,769 --> 0:8:48,289
Look how big I am

255
0:8:48,289 --> 0:8:49,48
I am big and strong

256
0:8:49,48 --> 0:8:51,24
But these things are external

257
0:8:51,24 --> 0:8:54,91
They don't represent your true inner self

258
0:8:54,91 --> 0:8:57,91
This is often referred to as the small man syndrome

259
0:8:57,91 --> 0:8:58,55
Exactly

260
0:8:58,55 --> 0:9:3,769
Napoleon complex is when you feel shorter and less secure inside

261
0:9:3,769 --> 0:9:5,739
The weaker and softer you feel inside

262
0:9:5,739 --> 0:9:7,559
You need external things

263
0:9:7,559 --> 0:9:9,439
big cars with loud speakers

264
0:9:9,439 --> 0:9:10,959
high-displacement motorcycles

265
0:9:10,959 --> 0:9:11,979
large houses

266
0:9:11,979 --> 0:9:15,49
and fancy fashion items

267
0:9:15,49 --> 0:9:17,5
to dress yourself up

268
0:9:17,5 --> 0:9:18,31
I'm not a bumpkin

269
0:9:18,31 --> 0:9:21,26
I often see those on Douyin

270
0:9:21,26 --> 0:9:23,7
so-called unscrupulous marketing accounts and self-media

271
0:9:23,7 --> 0:9:26,319
Those hosts often

272
0:9:26,319 --> 0:9:28,999
I’m not saying they are 3D people

273
0:9:28,999 --> 0:9:31,14
but they have low education

274
0:9:31,14 --> 0:9:33,38
and low quality

275
0:9:33,38 --> 0:9:35,82
let’s not even talk about the third low

276
0:9:35,82 --> 0:9:39,629
but you see, they dress in a certain way

277
0:9:39,629 --> 0:9:40,8
all dressed up

278
0:9:40,8 --> 0:9:42,72
but once they open their mouths

279
0:9:42,72 --> 0:9:43,5
you know right away

280
0:9:43,5 --> 0:9:45,82
This person must not have received much education.

281
0:9:45,82 --> 0:9:47,23
They can't even speak Mandarin properly.

282
0:9:47,23 --> 0:9:49,91
Of course, we're not saying that everyone who speaks poor Mandarin

283
0:9:49,91 --> 0:9:51,35
hasn't been educated.

284
0:9:51,35 --> 0:9:53,1
You can't draw that kind of equivalence.

285
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:56,66
But people like this do tend to carry that kind of stereotype.

286
0:9:56,66 --> 0:10:0,53
You'll notice the audience they face

287
0:10:0,53 --> 0:10:2,88
and they themselves belong to the same group.

288
0:10:2,88 --> 0:10:6,8
Clearly, they have the characteristics of 3D individuals.

289
0:10:6,8 --> 0:10:8,8
Let's talk about how to specifically define this 3D character.

290
0:10:8,8 --> 0:10:10,1
This is more about defining the style.

291
0:10:10,1 --> 0:10:12,46
I won't speculate unnecessarily.

292
0:10:12,46 --> 0:10:13,82
But let me tell you,

293
0:10:13,82 --> 0:10:18,96
the core of consumerism lies in its substantive content.

294
0:10:18,96 --> 0:10:20,64
It stems from childhood trauma.

295
0:10:20,64 --> 0:10:24,52
It comes from the instability in your inner core.

296
0:10:24,52 --> 0:10:27,16
It arises from your lack of confidence.

297
0:10:27,16 --> 0:10:28,8
Lack of self-reliance and self-respect.

298
0:10:28,8 --> 0:10:29,68
Self-respect is something we give to ourselves.

299
0:10:29,68 --> 0:10:31,69
If you give yourself enough respect,

300
0:10:31,69 --> 0:10:34,41
you might think, 'I am beautiful',

301
0:10:34,41 --> 0:10:36,69
I am strong',

302
0:10:36,69 --> 0:10:38,55
'I have a purpose in life',

303
0:10:38,55 --> 0:10:40,15
'I have the ability to serve the people'.

304
0:10:40,15 --> 0:10:42,53
At such times, you won't have any inner instability.

305
0:10:42,53 --> 0:10:45,1
This is a common belief.

306
0:10:45,1 --> 0:10:46,53
There's a saying like this

307
0:10:46,77 --> 0:10:49,1
Generally speaking, where does inner instability come from?

308
0:10:49,1 --> 0:10:50,69
Your dad and mom criticize you.

309
0:10:50,69 --> 0:10:52,47
They say, 'Why are you like this?'

310
0:10:52,47 --> 0:10:53,59
You can't handle situations well.

311
0:10:53,59 --> 0:10:55,8
Look, yesterday when I interacted with someone,

312
0:10:55,8 --> 0:10:56,56
When I was with my dad,

313
0:10:56,56 --> 0:10:57,84
I really get annoyed when I'm with my dad.

314
0:10:57,84 --> 0:10:58,96
My dad always likes to lecture me.

315
0:10:58,96 --> 0:11:0,46
But sometimes, his advice is right.

316
0:11:0,46 --> 0:11:2,13
Sometimes his way of teaching is not right.

317
0:11:2,13 --> 0:11:3,25
But I find it really annoying.

318
0:11:3,25 --> 0:11:3,77
He lectures me.

319
0:11:3,77 --> 0:11:4,65
Look, I’m 41 years old.

320
0:11:4,65 --> 0:11:5,57
And you’re still lecturing me?

321
0:11:5,57 --> 0:11:7,7
But to be fair,

322
0:11:7,7 --> 0:11:8,71
I do make some mistakes.

323
0:11:8,71 --> 0:11:12,3
His reminders do have their own merit.

324
0:11:12,3 --> 0:11:13,4
Listen to your parents.

325
0:11:13,4 --> 0:11:14,56
Just add half of it.

326
0:11:14,56 --> 0:11:16,0
Be filial, be filial.

327
0:11:16,0 --> 0:11:16,98
Being filial is enough.

328
0:11:16,98 --> 0:11:18,1
Don't just obey.

329
0:11:18,1 --> 0:11:19,339
Show respect.

330
0:11:19,339 --> 0:11:20,659
Showing respect is enough.

331
0:11:20,659 --> 0:11:22,4
You don't have to always obey them.

332
0:11:22,4 --> 0:11:24,1
But sometimes parents are like that.

333
0:11:24,1 --> 0:11:25,92
Some parents might say that.

334
0:11:25,92 --> 0:11:27,4
My dad and mom still remind me

335
0:11:27,4 --> 0:11:28,4
When I make a mistake

336
0:11:28,4 --> 0:11:28,48
They remind me

337
0:11:28,48 --> 0:11:29,8
But some people's parents

338
0:11:29,8 --> 0:11:32,47
Just completely overstep their bounds

339
0:11:32,47 --> 0:11:33,97
Saying all sorts of things about how you're not good enough

340
0:11:33,97 --> 0:11:35,1
You're not good-looking

341
0:11:35,1 --> 0:11:36,39
You won't be able to sell yourself this way

342
0:11:36,39 --> 0:11:39,22
And you're not smart enough to study like this

343
0:11:39,22 --> 0:11:40,46
You left the money at home

344
0:11:40,46 --> 0:11:42,44
We all do this when we buy a house together

345
0:11:42,44 --> 0:11:46,109
So parents often try to belittle you

346
0:11:46,109 --> 0:11:47,249
to undermine you

347
0:11:47,249 --> 0:11:48,289
in order to control you

348
0:11:48,289 --> 0:11:49,31
that's how it is

349
0:11:49,31 --> 0:11:50,45
some bosses are like that too

350
0:11:50,45 --> 0:11:51,87
that's why some people say

351
0:11:51,87 --> 0:11:55,18
you can't buy a fancy car if you work for a state-owned enterprise

352
0:11:55,18 --> 0:11:55,84
That's it.

353
0:11:55,84 --> 0:11:57,12
Why can't you buy a really nice car?

354
0:11:57,12 --> 0:11:58,96
Because if your car is too nice,

355
0:11:58,96 --> 0:12:1,14
you'll make others feel inferior.

356
0:12:1,14 --> 0:12:2,6
So that's Brother Rong's strategy.

357
0:12:2,6 --> 0:12:4,1
I choose from all the motorcycles,

358
0:12:4,1 --> 0:12:7,54
my favorite one that can extend the range.

359
0:12:7,54 --> 0:12:10,88
And the small scooter with a 125cc engine can also handle the highway.

360
0:12:10,88 --> 0:12:12,36
But I don't usually use the highway.

361
0:12:12,36 --> 0:12:14,68
But the 725 with the small engine

362
0:12:14,68 --> 0:12:16,6
occasionally slipping into the bike lane

363
0:12:16,6 --> 0:12:18,7
makes people think, 'Oh, it’s just like a scooter'

364
0:12:18,7 --> 0:12:19,38
no big deal

365
0:12:19,78 --> 0:12:21,46
if you were riding a 1250 over there

366
0:12:21,46 --> 0:12:24,8
wouldn’t it feel more significant to be on the motor vehicle lane?

367
0:12:24,8 --> 0:12:25,96
even if my 125 goes onto the sidewalk

368
0:12:25,96 --> 0:12:26,84
you can’t really say anything

369
0:12:26,84 --> 0:12:27,16
right?

370
0:12:27,16 --> 0:12:28,46
I just push it along.

371
0:12:28,46 --> 0:12:29,89
And it’s very light.

372
0:12:29,89 --> 0:12:30,91
Really light.

373
0:12:30,91 --> 0:12:32,21
It has the same weight as a skateboard.

374
0:12:32,21 --> 0:12:32,77
Right?

375
0:12:32,77 --> 0:12:33,89
And speaking of which,

376
0:12:33,89 --> 0:12:36,97
This mini, mini car is also my micro car.

377
0:12:36,97 --> 0:12:38,29
It’s super convenient to park anywhere.

378
0:12:38,29 --> 0:12:39,25
Just squeeze it in there.

379
0:12:39,25 --> 0:12:40,78
People say it’s a toy for old men

380
0:12:40,78 --> 0:12:42,46
Yeah, at first glance, it looks like a toy for old men

381
0:12:42,46 --> 0:12:43,0
But I’m afraid to bump into it

382
0:12:43,0 --> 0:12:44,3
You’re really amusing

383
0:12:44,3 --> 0:12:46,9
Because I thought there might be an old man inside the toy, right?

384
0:12:46,9 --> 0:12:48,639
Turns out it’s just a little old man

385
0:12:48,639 --> 0:12:50,109
Because parking is so convenient this way

386
0:12:50,109 --> 0:12:52,369
And refueling is quick too

387
0:12:52,369 --> 0:12:54,109
Charging takes only half an hour to be full

388
0:12:54,109 --> 0:12:56,9
In reality, it's about reserving a car slot.

389
0:12:56,9 --> 0:12:58,26
You have to buy this slot, no way around it.

390
0:12:58,26 --> 0:12:59,48
If I want to buy a BYD car,

391
0:12:59,48 --> 0:13:0,56
what would it cost?

392
0:13:0,56 --> 0:13:1,98
At least 60 to 90 thousand,

393
0:13:1,98 --> 0:13:3,84
120 thousand for a car,

394
0:13:3,84 --> 0:13:5,44
that’s another chunk of money.

395
0:13:5,44 --> 0:13:6,68
No matter how much money you have,

396
0:13:6,68 --> 0:13:7,84
you’re still spending over ten thousand.

397
0:13:7,84 --> 0:13:9,88
That also takes up your wealth, doesn't it?

398
0:13:9,88 --> 0:13:11,76
A significant portion of it.

399
0:13:11,76 --> 0:13:12,26
Right?

400
0:13:12,26 --> 0:13:14,9
So, buying a car for a station is pretty good.

401
0:13:14,9 --> 0:13:16,68
Actually, I don't really have the chance.

402
0:13:16,68 --> 0:13:17,68
There aren't many occasions to drive it.

403
0:13:17,68 --> 0:13:19,47
It doesn't take the kids anywhere.

404
0:13:19,47 --> 0:13:20,49
And it's not for commuting.

405
0:13:20,49 --> 0:13:22,43
It's just a tool for entertainment, after all.

406
0:13:22,43 --> 0:13:23,99
Today, I went out for dinner with friends.

407
0:13:23,99 --> 0:13:24,839
We drove out.

408
0:13:24,839 --> 0:13:27,59
Then, we had to find a designated driver first.

409
0:13:27,59 --> 0:13:28,23
Recharge the battery first.

410
0:13:28,23 --> 0:13:28,77
After recharging,

411
0:13:28,77 --> 0:13:29,85
drive back.

412
0:13:29,85 --> 0:13:30,67
That's how it goes.

413
0:13:30,67 --> 0:13:31,45
A day of driving,

414
0:13:31,45 --> 0:13:32,17
a day of charging.

415
0:13:32,17 --> 0:13:32,79
It's just like this

416
0:13:32,79 --> 0:13:34,45
Although he finds it quite boring

417
0:13:34,45 --> 0:13:36,375
But he saved a lot of money

418
0:13:37,9 --> 0:13:38,1
Because he saved a lot of money

419
0:13:38,1 --> 0:13:40,69
Because my core values are very stable

420
0:13:40,69 --> 0:13:42,27
I know exactly how much money I have

421
0:13:42,27 --> 0:13:44,349
I also know my capabilities

422
0:13:44,349 --> 0:13:46,84
I'm also very satisfied with my current state

423
0:13:46,84 --> 0:13:50,22
I don't feel I owe myself anything

424
0:13:50,22 --> 0:13:51,64
All the things I feel I've been lacking

425
0:13:51,64 --> 0:13:53,89
I might have some things I feel I've been missing out on

426
0:13:53,89 --> 0:13:55,249
Like not having enough toy guns when I was a kid

427
0:13:55,569 --> 0:13:57,149
Growing up, I wanted to go to North America

428
0:13:57,149 --> 0:13:58,44
To buy more stuff

429
0:13:58,44 --> 0:13:59,2
Like water guns and such

430
0:13:59,2 --> 0:14:1,56
These things are probably what I missed out on in my childhood

431
0:14:1,56 --> 0:14:2,64
But speaking of what's available here in China

432
0:14:2,64 --> 0:14:4,54
I have more than enough

433
0:14:4,54 --> 0:14:5,66
I'm very content.

434
0:14:5,66 --> 0:14:7,3
Considering my current state,

435
0:14:7,3 --> 0:14:9,68
I don't feel like there's anything missing in my life.

436
0:14:9,68 --> 0:14:11,73
I've bought all the gaming consoles I could want.

437
0:14:11,73 --> 0:14:12,45
Right?

438
0:14:12,45 --> 0:14:14,31
I've got all the electronic gadgets I need.

439
0:14:14,31 --> 0:14:15,63
I have a pile of books.

440
0:14:15,63 --> 0:14:18,3
I don't really care about cars or houses.

441
0:14:18,3 --> 0:14:19,25
As long as I have a place to live, that's fine.

442
0:14:19,25 --> 0:14:21,75
As long as the car can move, that’s fine.

443
0:14:21,75 --> 0:14:22,65
As long as it can move.

444
0:14:22,65 --> 0:14:23,77
I’ll go with Latam.

445
0:14:23,77 --> 0:14:24,53
It’s already level 13.

446
0:14:24,53 --> 0:14:27,6
For me, as long as it can move, that’s all I care about.

447
0:14:27,6 --> 0:14:29,7
So today, we’re going to delve into something deeper.

448
0:14:29,7 --> 0:14:31,86
Something on a more profound level.

449
0:14:31,86 --> 0:14:32,9
It’s not about pride.

450
0:14:32,9 --> 0:14:33,46
It’s not about anything else.

451
0:14:33,46 --> 0:14:36,2
What is the goal of your lifelong struggle?

452
0:14:36,2 --> 0:14:37,14
With all this effort you're putting in,

453
0:14:37,14 --> 0:14:38,66
What is it all for?

454
0:14:38,66 --> 0:14:39,18
Buddy,

455
0:14:39,18 --> 0:14:40,16
What is it for?

456
0:14:40,16 --> 0:14:44,55
Why do you need to earn so much money?

457
0:14:45,7 --> 0:14:47,13
Why do you have to live a 9-to-5 life,

458
0:14:47,13 --> 0:14:49,17
Or even a 996 lifestyle,

459
0:14:49,17 --> 0:14:51,3
What's the purpose of earning money?

460
0:14:51,3 --> 0:14:53,7
Can the money you earn cover

461
0:14:53,7 --> 0:14:55,78
the 2,000 calories you need each day

462
0:14:55,78 --> 0:14:58,71
If the money you earn is enough to support your family

463
0:14:58,71 --> 0:15:1,37
then what's the purpose of saving money?

464
0:15:1,37 --> 0:15:2,91
Sun Yuchen has a book

465
0:15:2,91 --> 0:15:6,5
the content in that book is quite similar to some of mine

466
0:15:6,5 --> 0:15:7,17
it's actually pretty close

467
0:15:7,17 --> 0:15:9,5
Of course, I'm not as impressive as Teacher Sun

468
0:15:9,5 --> 0:15:10,61
Teacher Sun is truly amazing

469
0:15:10,61 --> 0:15:11,89
He's quite remarkable among people.

470
0:15:11,89 --> 0:15:13,97
He has a piece of paper that says he won't get married.

471
0:15:13,97 --> 0:15:15,46
He doesn't buy a house or a car.

472
0:15:15,46 --> 0:15:16,9
How do I spend my days?

473
0:15:16,9 --> 0:15:20,6
I noticed that all these people who want to build a career,

474
0:15:20,6 --> 0:15:21,58
actually have this mindset of not getting married,

475
0:15:21,58 --> 0:15:23,84
not buying a house or a car.

476
0:15:23,84 --> 0:15:24,8
This kind of thinking is

477
0:15:24,8 --> 0:15:28,17
because it's essential not to let your salary and a so-called

478
0:15:28,17 --> 0:15:30,15
A stable job ties you down

479
0:15:30,15 --> 0:15:31,49
It binds you tightly

480
0:15:31,49 --> 0:15:35,609
You no longer have the vision for innovation and expansion

481
0:15:35,609 --> 0:15:37,749
Or the mindset to start a business

482
0:15:37,749 --> 0:15:40,82
I mean, these cars

483
0:15:40,82 --> 0:15:42,58
Xiaomi Ultra S7

484
0:15:42,58 --> 0:15:43,92
These houses

485
0:15:43,92 --> 0:15:48,64
Is it really worth sacrificing your youth for these ready-to-move-in large apartments?

486
0:15:48,64 --> 0:15:50,86
Putting everything on the line and tying yourself to a job

487
0:15:50,86 --> 0:15:52,28
Binding the address

488
0:15:52,28 --> 0:15:54,22
Striving for everything

489
0:15:54,22 --> 0:15:56,18
It ultimately is just a purchase

490
0:15:56,18 --> 0:15:58,34
That feeling fades away in an instant

491
0:15:58,34 --> 0:16:1,98
Like how I managed to get a motorcycle and a car within a week

492
0:16:1,98 --> 0:16:4,86
In the end, the sense of ownership feels pretty good

493
0:16:4,86 --> 0:16:6,78
But I didn’t spend much

494
0:16:6,78 --> 0:16:8,26
The amount I spent

495
0:16:8,26 --> 0:16:11,38
This 40,000 yuan to me

496
0:16:11,38 --> 0:16:14,34
It's not that this 40,000 yuan isn't money

497
0:16:14,34 --> 0:16:15,8
But for me

498
0:16:15,8 --> 0:16:20,43
This amount, in half a month, yeah

499
0:16:20,43 --> 0:16:21,65
Not to mention half a month

500
0:16:22,69 --> 0:16:24,47
I could probably earn it in a week

501
0:16:24,47 --> 0:16:26,19
Yeah, of course, that's true

502
0:16:26,19 --> 0:16:29,39
Don't brag, can you do it in a month?

503
0:16:29,39 --> 0:16:30,11
Let's not talk about half a month

504
0:16:30,11 --> 0:16:30,75
Not even a week

505
0:16:30,75 --> 0:16:32,799
Let's just say when business isn't doing well

506
0:16:32,799 --> 0:16:34,199
I still manage to make some money in a month

507
0:16:34,199 --> 0:16:37,159
So for me, it's not a huge hit

508
0:16:37,159 --> 0:16:37,959
It's not a major setback

509
0:16:37,959 --> 0:16:39,92
It's not like I have to dip into my savings

510
0:16:39,92 --> 0:16:43,84
But you'll find that many people take out car loans for a few ten thousand dollar cars

511
0:16:43,84 --> 0:16:47,51
At least three or four hundred thousand, and they're paying it off over three to five years

512
0:16:47,51 --> 0:16:50,1
And they also owe the bank over a million for their mortgage

513
0:16:50,1 --> 0:16:52,25
In the end, it's just one house

514
0:16:52,25 --> 0:16:53,21
A car, you know

515
0:16:53,21 --> 0:16:55,109
how much of a difference can there be?

516
0:16:55,109 --> 0:16:57,429
And when I had a small car

517
0:16:57,429 --> 0:16:58,889
every time I took a taxi

518
0:16:58,889 --> 0:16:59,989
every time I rode in someone else’s car

519
0:16:59,989 --> 0:17:1,889
I always thought the car was so big

520
0:17:1,889 --> 0:17:3,69
You get it?

521
0:17:3,69 --> 0:17:5,709
Like when I said I got married

522
0:17:5,709 --> 0:17:7,49
my wife used to scold me a lot

523
0:17:7,49 --> 0:17:9,69
All the girls I met later

524
0:17:9,69 --> 0:17:10,969
I thought they were so patient

525
0:17:10,969 --> 0:17:14,579
Each one of them was so pleasant and had great emotional control

526
0:17:14,579 --> 0:17:16,539
It's because you've had something before

527
0:17:16,539 --> 0:17:17,939
You bring it up

528
0:17:17,939 --> 0:17:19,299
Of course, people are not objects

529
0:17:19,299 --> 0:17:21,8
It's about something you've had

530
0:17:21,8 --> 0:17:22,68
The state of having had something

531
0:17:22,68 --> 0:17:24,679
You tend to use it for comparison

532
0:17:24,679 --> 0:17:26,319
You should have a really nice car

533
0:17:26,319 --> 0:17:28,39
You should live in a spacious apartment

534
0:17:28,39 --> 0:17:29,339
I come from a wealthy family

535
0:17:29,339 --> 0:17:31,299
It's easy to go from frugality to luxury

536
0:17:31,299 --> 0:17:32,54
But it's hard to go from luxury back to frugality

537
0:17:32,54 --> 0:17:34,7
You guys always have a Maybach at home

538
0:17:34,7 --> 0:17:35,9
What kind of car will you ride when you go out

539
0:17:35,9 --> 0:17:36,78
You'll feel like everything else is just a toy

540
0:17:36,78 --> 0:17:37,5
It will all feel awkward

541
0:17:37,5 --> 0:17:39,19
Everyone thinks it smells like plastic

542
0:17:39,19 --> 0:17:40,51
You're eating Michelin-starred cuisine every day

543
0:17:40,51 --> 0:17:41,59
If you go out and eat from street vendors

544
0:17:41,59 --> 0:17:42,64
You might not be able to handle it

545
0:17:42,64 --> 0:17:45,36
You're used to living in luxury apartments with five-star standards

546
0:17:45,36 --> 0:17:46,72
Spending two or three million on the renovation

547
0:17:46,72 --> 0:17:48,72
Where would you stay after going out, in some budget hotels?

548
0:17:48,72 --> 0:17:49,77
You wouldn't be able to stay there

549
0:17:49,77 --> 0:17:51,39
Brother Rong is suffering

550
0:17:51,39 --> 0:17:52,77
I've been through tough times,

551
0:17:52,77 --> 0:17:54,389
like when I was studying abroad, it was hard too.

552
0:17:54,389 --> 0:17:56,809
So now, when I taste a bit of sweetness,

553
0:17:56,809 --> 0:17:58,229
I feel it's really damn sweet.

554
0:17:58,229 --> 0:17:58,629
You know?

555
0:17:58,629 --> 0:17:59,32
That's how it is.

556
0:17:59,32 --> 0:18:0,92
That's the experience of life.

557
0:18:0,92 --> 0:18:2,12
People always talk about raising boys with hardships,

558
0:18:2,12 --> 0:18:3,32
and girls with abundance and comfort.

559
0:18:3,32 --> 0:18:4,9
That's not entirely true.

560
0:18:4,9 --> 0:18:7,24
From a human perspective,

561
0:18:7,24 --> 0:18:9,2
You start with the bad,

562
0:18:10,14 --> 0:18:12,48
Or what you have is bad,

563
0:18:12,48 --> 0:18:14,92
But it can make the world feel so much better.

564
0:18:14,92 --> 0:18:16,56
Why do I keep telling everyone,

565
0:18:16,56 --> 0:18:18,4
Why does Brother Rong only wear a tank top,

566
0:18:18,4 --> 0:18:22,67
Why never talk about putting on a persona in front of the camera,

567
0:18:22,67 --> 0:18:24,37
Or setting up a study background

568
0:18:24,37 --> 0:18:25,57
Not inviting big names

569
0:18:25,57 --> 0:18:27,3
Just being myself like this

570
0:18:27,3 --> 0:18:28,95
Then showing this big face

571
0:18:28,95 --> 0:18:29,51
That's how it is

572
0:18:29,51 --> 0:18:30,56
I do it this way every time

573
0:18:30,56 --> 0:18:32,56
Because my starting point was low

574
0:18:32,56 --> 0:18:33,96
I just need to raise the bar a bit

575
0:18:33,96 --> 0:18:36,34
I might invite someone to do a bit of makeup

576
0:18:36,34 --> 0:18:39,8
Do a bit of sound design

577
0:18:39,8 --> 0:18:41,889
The whole feel is just different now.

578
0:18:41,889 --> 0:18:44,309
My starting point is this little step.

579
0:18:44,309 --> 0:18:45,589
It's a small electric scooter.

580
0:18:45,589 --> 0:18:46,449
Number 9.

581
0:18:46,449 --> 0:18:48,36
A tiny step, right?

582
0:18:48,36 --> 0:18:51,46
Then there's this little panda knight car.

583
0:18:51,46 --> 0:18:53,99
So no matter what I have in the future,

584
0:18:53,99 --> 0:18:56,71
I'll always compare it to this starting point.

585
0:18:56,71 --> 0:18:59,949
I know I came out riding an electric scooter.

586
0:18:59,949 --> 0:19:4,29
So I believe I shouldn’t have something that’s overly good

587
0:19:4,29 --> 0:19:5,509
or overly expensive

588
0:19:5,509 --> 0:19:8,7
which means my maintenance costs are relatively low

589
0:19:9,6 --> 0:19:10,94
giving me more time

590
0:19:10,94 --> 0:19:13,14
and more energy to make money

591
0:19:13,14 --> 0:19:14,72
and when I talk about making money

592
0:19:14,72 --> 0:19:15,96
I don’t feel it’s ever enough

593
0:19:15,96 --> 0:19:18,86
because many people earn money to fuel their consumption

594
0:19:18,86 --> 0:19:21,31
you know, I had a girlfriend before

595
0:19:21,31 --> 0:19:23,67
He's making a lot of money now.

596
0:19:23,67 --> 0:19:24,99
But he's really wearing himself out.

597
0:19:24,99 --> 0:19:28,8
He works incredibly hard.

598
0:19:28,8 --> 0:19:29,32
Actually, he earns quite a bit.

599
0:19:29,32 --> 0:19:30,76
To be honest, at the moment,

600
0:19:30,76 --> 0:19:32,4
There have been a few months where he's earned more than me.

601
0:19:32,4 --> 0:19:32,96
Honestly,

602
0:19:32,96 --> 0:19:35,28
Of course, I don't do anything at all.

603
0:19:35,28 --> 0:19:36,84
He works himself to the bone every day.

604
0:19:36,84 --> 0:19:38,24
This can't be compared.

605
0:19:38,24 --> 0:19:40,959
But he was in his youth,

606
0:19:40,959 --> 0:19:43,259
he had so many wonderful things.

607
0:19:43,259 --> 0:19:45,219
His ex-boyfriend was very wealthy.

608
0:19:45,219 --> 0:19:46,739
Very beautiful items.

609
0:19:46,739 --> 0:19:49,429
Everything from food to clothing was of good quality.

610
0:19:49,429 --> 0:19:52,169
So her goal is to be an independent woman,

611
0:19:52,169 --> 0:19:54,709
I want to have these things.

612
0:19:54,709 --> 0:19:56,19
So I need to work hard and earn money.

613
0:19:56,19 --> 0:19:58,89
I just find him quite ridiculous, to be honest.

614
0:19:58,89 --> 0:20:1,879
Of course, I’ll keep encouraging her.

615
0:20:1,879 --> 0:20:3,699
To buy things she likes.

616
0:20:3,699 --> 0:20:5,339
In the past, other men would buy things for you.

617
0:20:5,339 --> 0:20:7,469
Now you can buy them yourself, showing your capability.

618
0:20:7,469 --> 0:20:9,389
But I just want to point this out.

619
0:20:9,389 --> 0:20:14,74
These things don’t define you; you’re already very attractive.

620
0:20:14,74 --> 0:20:17,79
You’d still be very attractive without these things.

621
0:20:17,79 --> 0:20:19,55
You’ve always been quite attractive.

622
0:20:19,55 --> 0:20:20,19
Right?

623
0:20:20,19 --> 0:20:24,9
So the difference between being able to afford these luxury items and not being able to afford them is not that significant.

624
0:20:24,9 --> 0:20:28,53
In the end, you work so hard,

625
0:20:28,53 --> 0:20:30,57
I hope he can reinvest it in production.

626
0:20:30,57 --> 0:20:32,81
Completely stop working.

627
0:20:32,81 --> 0:20:33,969
But he might first invest in a car,

628
0:20:33,969 --> 0:20:36,889
a bag,

629
0:20:36,889 --> 0:20:37,549
These things help people feel good about themselves.

630
0:20:37,549 --> 0:20:39,73
These things make one feel good about themselves

631
0:20:39,73 --> 0:20:40,93
That's quite amusing.

632
0:20:40,93 --> 0:20:42,69
She's already a stunning beauty.

633
0:20:42,69 --> 0:20:45,13
But this thing, it's different for boys and girls.

634
0:20:45,13 --> 0:20:46,65
We shouldn't advise women,

635
0:20:46,65 --> 0:20:48,48
especially independent women.

636
0:20:48,48 --> 0:20:50,32
We can help them in their careers,

637
0:20:50,32 --> 0:20:51,44
but how they spend their money

638
0:20:51,44 --> 0:20:52,36
is their business.

639
0:20:52,36 --> 0:20:53,94
But I just wanted to point that out.

640
0:20:53,94 --> 0:20:55,53
Whether male or female

641
0:20:55,53 --> 0:20:58,13
I actually see myself as gender-neutral

642
0:20:58,13 --> 0:21:1,37
I consider myself to be genderless

643
0:21:1,37 --> 0:21:4,5
Because I don’t have the typical flaws of either men or women

644
0:21:4,5 --> 0:21:4,69
I don’t have them

645
0:21:4,69 --> 0:21:6,25
For instance, men spend money to satisfy their ego

646
0:21:6,25 --> 0:21:8,43
And women spend money to satisfy their vanity

647
0:21:8,43 --> 0:21:9,6
To be honest

648
0:21:12,3 --> 0:21:16,12
This could make your work extremely painful

649
0:21:16,12 --> 0:21:18,409
For example, if you make a million dollars

650
0:21:18,409 --> 0:21:20,849
you can use that million to hire people

651
0:21:20,849 --> 0:21:21,809
to expand production

652
0:21:21,809 --> 0:21:23,709
and you might completely step away from labor

653
0:21:23,709 --> 0:21:27,25
but if you spend that million on a Cayenne

654
0:21:27,25 --> 0:21:29,27
isn't it gone?

655
0:21:29,27 --> 0:21:30,45
Isn't it gone?

656
0:21:30,45 --> 0:21:31,49
Isn't it gone, buddy?

657
0:21:31,49 --> 0:21:32,75
then you have to earn another million

658
0:21:32,75 --> 0:21:33,64
which could scare the hell out of you

659
0:21:33,64 --> 0:21:34,8
can you even make another million?

660
0:21:34,8 --> 0:21:37,14
You've traded your youth and labor for it

661
0:21:37,14 --> 0:21:38,0
your time

662
0:21:38,0 --> 0:21:39,2
your health

663
0:21:39,2 --> 0:21:41,75
do you think a million will always be that easy to earn?

664
0:21:41,75 --> 0:21:43,15
Earning a million at 20

665
0:21:43,15 --> 0:21:43,67
is different from 30

666
0:21:43,67 --> 0:21:44,7
40

667
0:21:44,7 --> 0:21:45,51
50 or 60, can it be the same?

668
0:21:45,51 --> 0:21:46,19
Buddy

669
0:21:46,19 --> 0:21:48,41
you need to figure out how to make money with money

670
0:21:48,41 --> 0:21:49,34
right?

671
0:21:49,34 --> 0:21:50,9
exploit surplus value

672
0:21:50,9 --> 0:21:53,2
and have employees help you make money

673
0:21:53,2 --> 0:21:54,38
you need to set goals for your employees

674
0:21:54,38 --> 0:21:55,9
you can't do everything yourself

675
0:21:55,9 --> 0:21:58,26
so this is a huge conflict in mindset

676
0:21:58,26 --> 0:21:59,73
that's what we're talking about here

677
0:21:59,73 --> 0:22:2,31
in this episode, we mainly talk about spending less

678
0:22:2,31 --> 0:22:4,68
spending less means you won't be so tired

679
0:22:4,68 --> 0:22:6,6
it's a simple and obvious truth

680
0:22:6,6 --> 0:22:7,84
Brother Long contributes this to you

681
0:22:7,84 --> 0:22:9,44
today, before starting the renovation

682
0:22:9,44 --> 0:22:11,23
before the drill starts

683
0:22:11,23 --> 0:22:12,5
we made this episode

684
0:22:12,5 --> 0:22:13,99
hoping everyone has a happy day every day

685
0:22:13,99 --> 0:22:16,42
keep your desires small

686
0:22:16,42 --> 0:22:20,98
don't compare with others, keep your inner core stable

687
0:22:20,98 --> 0:22:22,54
take care of your health

688
0:22:22,54 --> 0:22:25,79
keep your core stable and the external things

689
0:22:25,79 --> 0:22:27,37
keep your desires small

690
0:22:27,37 --> 0:22:28,15
it's fine

691
0:22:28,15 --> 0:22:29,55
read the classics of Taoism

692
0:22:29,55 --> 0:22:31,37
read the classics of Buddhism

693
0:22:31,37 --> 0:22:35,9
to make your mind more peaceful, adopt an indifferent and carefree attitude

694
0:22:35,9 --> 0:22:37,1
experience this impermanent world

695
0:22:37,1 --> 0:22:39,63
clear your mind of consumerism

696
0:22:39,63 --> 0:22:41,13
watch less ads

697
0:22:41,13 --> 0:22:42,949
buy a smaller car

698
0:22:42,949 --> 0:22:44,609
a smaller motorcycle

699
0:22:44,609 --> 0:22:46,189
live in a smaller home

700
0:22:46,189 --> 0:22:46,969
right?

701
0:22:46,969 --> 0:22:48,629
marry a simple wife

702
0:22:48,629 --> 0:22:49,99
have a simple child

703
0:22:49,99 --> 0:22:51,69
it won't cost as much

704
0:22:51,69 --> 0:22:53,7
buying a big house

705
0:22:53,7 --> 0:22:53,97
a big car

706
0:22:53,97 --> 0:22:57,159
big things actually cost a lot

707
0:22:57,159 --> 0:23:0,699
consumerism means the more stable your inner core is

708
0:23:0,699 --> 0:23:3,39
the more stable your self-esteem is

709
0:23:3,39 --> 0:23:4,61
the more stable your vanity is

710
0:23:4,61 --> 0:23:6,95
the less it will trigger your desire to consume

711
0:23:6,95 --> 0:23:8,91
and working to satisfy consumption desires

712
0:23:8,91 --> 0:23:12,7
is a very miserable life

713
0:23:12,7 --> 0:23:16,9
having small desires can make you less tired

714
0:23:16,9 --> 0:23:17,19
see what kind of desires

715
0:23:17,19 --> 0:23:19,24
the smaller your desires are

716
0:23:19,24 --> 0:23:20,7
the less your body is strained

717
0:23:20,7 --> 0:23:22,2
the longer your life will be

718
0:23:22,2 --> 0:23:24,32
the more you can appreciate the beauty of life

719
0:23:24,32 --> 0:23:25,4
of course, speaking of which

720
0:23:25,4 --> 0:23:26,42
buying a new car

721
0:23:26,42 --> 0:23:27,38
a new motorcycle

722
0:23:27,38 --> 0:23:29,32
a new house is still very joyful

723
0:23:29,32 --> 0:23:32,12
but the joy only lasts a week
