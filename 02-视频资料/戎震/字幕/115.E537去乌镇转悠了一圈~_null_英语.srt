1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,94
Let me take a picture for everyone.

2
0:0:0,94 --> 0:0:4,79
This is the hotel in the scenic area where I'm staying.

3
0:0:5,19 --> 0:0:7,37
This is the food I brought on the high-speed train.

4
0:0:7,37 --> 0:0:8,71
The previous hotel

5
0:0:8,71 --> 0:0:12,58
was at the West Lake Cultural Square.

6
0:0:12,58 --> 0:0:15,62
left these Yage Hotel tissues behind.

7
0:0:15,62 --> 0:0:19,32
Then, for these 17 minutes, they also gave me a high-speed train meal.

8
0:0:19,32 --> 0:0:21,18
Thanks to Fuzhou Railway Bureau.

9
0:0:21,18 --> 0:0:23,16
This is my backpack.

10
0:0:23,16 --> 0:0:25,92
Inside are two books I wrote

11
0:0:25,92 --> 0:0:29,12
for two UPloaders in Hangzhou and Shanghai

12
0:0:29,12 --> 0:0:31,48
and one has already been given away

13
0:0:31,48 --> 0:0:33,16
to the Bilibili staff

14
0:0:33,16 --> 0:0:35,84
and this is the toothbrush from the previous hotel

15
0:0:35,84 --> 0:0:38,32
as expected, the new hotel here didn't provide a toothbrush

16
0:0:38,32 --> 0:0:39,64
but it's all good

17
0:0:39,64 --> 0:0:43,24
and they told us there weren't enough king rooms available

18
0:0:43,24 --> 0:0:44,52
so we ended up in a standard room

19
0:0:44,52 --> 0:0:47,3
But this standard room is quite spacious.

20
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:48,4
It’s more like a suite.

21
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:49,26
Not exactly a suite, though.

22
0:0:49,26 --> 0:0:50,8
Anyway, there’s also a sofa.

23
0:0:50,8 --> 0:0:52,26
It’s pretty good.

24
0:0:52,26 --> 0:0:54,66
You can sit here to eat or something.

25
0:0:54,66 --> 0:0:56,5
That’s how it looks.

26
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:58,68
This is me leaving the hotel.

27
0:0:58,68 --> 0:1:0,459
The hotel is really great.

28
0:1:0,459 --> 0:1:5,12
a resort or summer retreat

29
0:1:6,22 --> 0:1:7,63
there's a river nearby

30
0:1:7,63 --> 0:1:11,15
the entire city is like a huge park

31
0:1:11,15 --> 0:1:13,61
tomorrow's venue is close by

32
0:1:13,61 --> 0:1:16,5
I'll take a little stroll around

33
0:1:16,29 --> 0:1:17,97
the environment is really great

34
0:1:19,77 --> 0:1:22,12
how about the overall

35
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:25,56
atmosphere is particularly comfortable

36
0:1:25,56 --> 0:1:27,86
this is also my participation in a Bilibili event

37
0:1:27,86 --> 0:1:29,6
How many times has this been now?

38
0:1:29,6 --> 0:1:31,86
There was one time in Xiamen before.

39
0:1:31,86 --> 0:1:33,48
That was in the Streamer Zone.

40
0:1:33,48 --> 0:1:37,2
And it was back in 2024.

41
0:1:37,2 --> 0:1:40,14
This year, there was a fan meet-up that was a key event.

42
0:1:40,14 --> 0:1:42,54
It was organized really well for me.

43
0:1:42,54 --> 0:1:47,689
I also came to Bilibili to say hello and introduce myself.

44
0:1:47,689 --> 0:1:51,26
I’ve come twice on my own expense to pay respects.

45
0:1:51,66 --> 0:1:53,2
I forgot the reason for those visits.

46
0:1:53,2 --> 0:1:55,82
Well, I volunteered to come over.

47
0:1:55,82 --> 0:1:58,6
It’s a business meeting, after all.

48
0:1:58,6 --> 0:2:0,44
I need to be proactive.

49
0:2:1,82 --> 0:2:4,5
This place is actually like many ancient towns.

50
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:6,58
Yes.

51
0:2:6,58 --> 0:2:8,68
But the crowd here is pretty good.

52
0:2:9,88 --> 0:2:11,92
There are a lot of tourists.

53
0:2:13,52 --> 0:2:15,56
It feels different from other ancient towns.

54
0:2:15,56 --> 0:2:18,6
Wuzhen, after all, has the Opera Festival.

55
0:2:18,6 --> 0:2:20,4
There are all sorts of activities.

56
0:2:20,68 --> 0:2:22,4
So the overall experience is pretty good.

57
0:2:23,44 --> 0:2:24,88
But after getting off the high-speed train,

58
0:2:24,88 --> 0:2:27,89
it takes about a 40-minute drive to get there.

59
0:2:28,17 --> 0:2:29,37
Forty minutes is quite a while.

60
0:2:30,97 --> 0:2:32,41
But our travel expenses are reimbursed.

61
0:2:32,41 --> 0:2:34,459
Hehe, not bad.

62
0:2:34,459 --> 0:2:36,639
Still, it’s Bilibili covering the cost for second-class seats.

63
0:2:36,639 --> 0:2:38,279
I really can’t stand second-class seats.

64
0:2:38,279 --> 0:2:39,459
I said forget it.

65
0:2:39,459 --> 0:2:40,539
I'll just buy it myself.

66
0:2:40,539 --> 0:2:44,76
But the Didi expenses were still reimbursed, though.

67
0:2:44,76 --> 0:2:46,16
But it doesn't really matter.

68
0:2:46,16 --> 0:2:49,8
A hundred or two is not much.

69
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:52,2
The CCTV channel has been very helpful to me.

70
0:2:52,2 --> 0:2:54,62
It's also a significant source of revenue for many Bilibili creators.

71
0:2:54,62 --> 0:2:56,7
And it's the main source of income for UPloaders.

72
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:58,98
So it's actually quite powerful.

73
0:2:58,98 --> 0:3:0,9
We all agreed to come.

74
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:2,899
Let's check out the others tomorrow.

75
0:3:2,899 --> 0:3:5,559
Of course, the internal meeting can't be shared.

76
0:3:5,559 --> 0:3:9,86
But we can still take a look before and after the meeting.

77
0:3:9,86 --> 0:3:12,68
I'll take some shots of the bridge station for everyone.

78
0:3:12,92 --> 0:3:14,22
Don't go too far.

79
0:3:14,22 --> 0:3:15,38
It doesn't feel safe.

80
0:3:15,38 --> 0:3:17,799
The scenery here is so beautiful with the water.

81
0:3:17,799 --> 0:3:19,599
Coming here alone is quite something.

82
0:3:27,16 --> 0:3:29,6
I have no idea where the hell we are

83
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:31,7
Whatever, just take a look

84
0:3:31,7 --> 0:3:33,96
This is an ancient Greek theater

85
0:3:34,65 --> 0:3:35,87
An open-air theater

86
0:3:35,87 --> 0:3:37,69
Pretty interesting

87
0:3:40,14 --> 0:3:42,5
Let me take some photos for everyone

88
0:3:44,24 --> 0:3:50,1
Look, there are a bunch of girls in Hanfu behind us

89
0:3:50,42 --> 0:3:52,5
What the hell is worth taking photos of this thing

90
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:53,62
There's no performance right now

91
0:3:53,62 --> 0:3:56,2
Now it's just this pool of water

92
0:3:56,93 --> 0:3:59,65
I'm still wondering who made it so

93
0:3:59,65 --> 0:4:2,13
I feel like I look pretty ugly in photos taken on the street

94
0:4:2,13 --> 0:4:4,37
It might be due to the people, not the machine

95
0:4:4,37 --> 0:4:7,939
I'm sure I wouldn't see other UPs here otherwise

96
0:4:7,939 --> 0:4:9,93
I'm just wandering around by myself

97
0:4:9,93 --> 0:4:12,67
Actually, the event starts tomorrow

98
0:4:12,67 --> 0:4:15,38
But I can already check in today

99
0:4:15,38 --> 0:4:17,9
But I'm the only one here right now

100
0:4:17,9 --> 0:4:21,819
I think there are a few people who follow me, whether we're close or not.

101
0:4:21,819 --> 0:4:25,99
But they're all big names, so they might not bother to respond to me.

102
0:4:25,99 --> 0:4:27,459
But I'm the kind of person who likes to make friends with others.

103
0:4:27,459 --> 0:4:30,529
I've added many other UPs on WeChat.

104
0:4:30,529 --> 0:4:31,849
But even if you add someone on WeChat,

105
0:4:31,849 --> 0:4:33,44
you don't always chat with them,

106
0:4:33,44 --> 0:4:34,84
so you don't really have much to talk about.

107
0:4:34,84 --> 0:4:36,84
Like, you need to have something in common.

108
0:4:36,84 --> 0:4:39,0
I think it's the boss's experience.

109
0:4:39,0 --> 0:4:40,56
I'm not sure when there will be a performance.

110
0:4:41,64 --> 0:4:42,68
Let's just treat it like a park visit.

111
0:4:43,96 --> 0:4:45,35
Which way should we go?

112
0:4:45,35 --> 0:4:48,12
You suggest we check this one out.

113
0:4:49,96 --> 0:4:51,16
The surroundings are pretty nice.

114
0:4:51,16 --> 0:4:52,48
Catch a bit of the breeze.

115
0:4:52,48 --> 0:4:53,76
We've also visited the hotel.

116
0:4:53,76 --> 0:4:54,78
It doesn't really matter.

117
0:4:54,78 --> 0:4:55,68
Don't rush, let's wait a bit.

118
0:4:55,68 --> 0:4:56,48
I'll call someone later

119
0:4:56,48 --> 0:4:58,7
Have a few people come over for me

120
0:4:58,7 --> 0:4:59,81
There are also many people shooting

121
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:1,539
Most of them are in full makeup

122
0:5:1,539 --> 0:5:5,559
I'll go check it out; all the ancient towns across the country are pretty much the same

123
0:5:5,559 --> 0:5:10,59
Hmm, not bad at all

124
0:5:10,79 --> 0:5:13,45
How did it fall over again?

125
0:5:13,45 --> 0:5:15,87
But let's move on to the next scene

126
0:5:16,87 --> 0:5:19,55
Hehe, I feel like having a proper coffee

127
0:5:19,55 --> 0:5:23,9
I have no idea if there are any chain stores or not

128
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:25,59
I’m not sure if the coffee is any good

129
0:5:25,59 --> 0:5:27,52
It should be fine

130
0:5:34,92 --> 0:5:35,7
We can take a boat

131
0:5:35,7 --> 0:5:38,92
It seems a bit awkward

132
0:5:39,83 --> 0:5:41,17
There are quite a few people

133
0:5:41,17 --> 0:5:42,91
There’s a hotel here too

134
0:5:44,6 --> 0:5:46,18
There are some bars inside the hotel as well

135
0:5:46,18 --> 0:5:48,38
But this area seems a bit more something

136
0:5:48,38 --> 0:5:51,4
I feel like we're in Houhai, um

137
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:53,93
There’s no one around, no friends

138
0:5:53,93 --> 0:5:55,95
Who could this be with?

139
0:5:55,95 --> 0:5:58,5
If one person comes again, what illness might they get?

140
0:5:58,5 --> 0:5:59,15
Hmm hmm hmm

141
0:5:59,15 --> 0:6:0,94
It doesn’t matter

142
0:6:2,6 --> 0:6:3,6
Such a nice hotel

143
0:6:3,6 --> 0:6:4,6
It’s fine not to use it either

144
0:6:4,6 --> 0:6:7,44
Isn’t it about this person?

145
0:6:7,44 --> 0:6:9,26
I’m thinking of going back, you know.

146
0:6:11,1 --> 0:6:12,3
There are quite a few elderly people here.

147
0:6:12,3 --> 0:6:13,84
Most of them are seniors.

148
0:6:14,82 --> 0:6:16,669
Young people, yeah.

149
0:6:16,669 --> 0:6:17,989
It’s all good.

150
0:6:18,989 --> 0:6:20,909
What if you fall into the river while hiding there?

151
0:6:20,909 --> 0:6:22,749
What would you do then?

152
0:6:25,16 --> 0:6:26,6
Older folks really enjoy taking photos.

153
0:6:27,92 --> 0:6:29,68
Young people like us in this profession.

154
0:6:29,68 --> 0:6:30,92
I can't help but take photos

155
0:6:30,92 --> 0:6:32,32
but to be honest, I find it quite annoying

156
0:6:32,32 --> 0:6:33,28
taking photos wherever I go

157
0:6:33,28 --> 0:6:34,6
really

158
0:6:35,61 --> 0:6:37,45
I won't venture further in

159
0:6:37,45 --> 0:6:41,1
this street seems to go on endlessly

160
0:6:41,1 --> 0:6:41,87
wow

161
0:6:41,87 --> 0:6:43,7
I want to get back to the hotel as soon as possible

162
0:6:43,94 --> 0:6:45,89
let me just take a quick look

163
0:6:46,41 --> 0:6:48,17
There seems to be a station over here

164
0:6:51,25 --> 0:6:54,659
Alright, I'll just walk then

165
0:6:54,659 --> 0:6:56,619
I'm out of energy

166
0:6:56,619 --> 0:6:57,739
I'm getting ready to head back to the hotel

167
0:6:57,739 --> 0:7:0,0
Hmph, just bored

168
0:7:0,0 --> 0:7:0,98
It's crowded everywhere

169
0:7:0,98 --> 0:7:2,12
There are quite a few elderly people

170
0:7:3,24 --> 0:7:5,32
I didn't see many pretty girls either

171
0:7:5,32 --> 0:7:6,8
Well

172
0:7:7,92 --> 0:7:10,44
Alright, back to the hotel

173
0:7:10,44 --> 0:7:14,33
Once back at the hotel, I'll start recording today's show

174
0:7:14,73 --> 0:7:16,21
I don't use silicone sealant very often

175
0:7:16,21 --> 0:7:18,5
I sold my Pocket 3

176
0:7:18,5 --> 0:7:20,81
Now I have the Action 5 Pro

177
0:7:20,81 --> 0:7:23,36
It's cheaper and waterproof

178
0:7:23,36 --> 0:7:25,44
It performs well in various conditions

179
0:7:25,44 --> 0:7:26,96
And it's mainly more discreet

180
0:7:26,96 --> 0:7:31,12
The DJI Osmo feels quite big when you're holding it

181
0:7:32,4 --> 0:7:35,44
When going out, it's better to bring a sports camera

182
0:7:37,6 --> 0:7:40,12
This spot is pretty good

183
0:7:40,12 --> 0:7:41,48
The scenery is absolutely beautiful

184
0:7:42,72 --> 0:7:44,16
Yeah, it's nice
