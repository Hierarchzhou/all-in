0:0:0,94 --> 0:0:1,54
Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,54 --> 0:0:2,46
Issue 508

3
0:0:2,46 --> 0:0:5,34
This time, we're going to discuss a rather novel concept

4
0:0:5,34 --> 0:0:7,49
which is the Hunter Mindset

5
0:0:7,49 --> 0:0:9,95
as well as the Farmer Mindset and the Merchant Mindset

6
0:0:9,95 --> 0:0:12,7
Throughout human evolution

7
0:0:12,7 --> 0:0:15,33
we first developed certain traits

8
0:0:15,33 --> 0:0:18,25
and then later on, we developed others

9
0:0:18,25 --> 0:0:20,37
which might seem useless at first glance

10
0:0:20,37 --> 0:0:24,2
In fact, people are constantly adapting to their environment.

11
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:25,52
And also changing the environment.

12
0:0:25,52 --> 0:0:27,68
Throughout human history,

13
0:0:27,68 --> 0:0:30,1
the time spent on hunting and gathering has been much longer,

14
0:0:30,1 --> 0:0:33,42
while the period of agricultural cultivation is relatively recent.

15
0:0:33,42 --> 0:0:34,8
It’s a settled way of life.

16
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:36,74
People used to migrate in large groups.

17
0:0:36,74 --> 0:0:40,269
The hunting lifestyle was similar to the migration patterns of animals.

18
0:0:40,269 --> 0:0:44,68
However, the modern industrial and commercial society has given rise to new professions.

19
0:0:44,68 --> 0:0:45,44
The merchant

20
0:0:45,44 --> 0:0:47,26
earns from arbitrage

21
0:0:47,26 --> 0:0:52,5
the true merchant, from the earliest traders to those skilled in emotional intelligence

22
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:53,59
to today's international merchants

23
0:0:53,59 --> 0:0:55,59
which means wherever there's an arbitrage opportunity

24
0:0:55,59 --> 0:0:57,18
there will be merchants

25
0:0:57,18 --> 0:0:59,54
but the difference between the hunter's mindset and the farmer's mindset

26
0:0:59,54 --> 0:1:0,82
what is the biggest distinction?

27
0:1:0,82 --> 0:1:3,82
is that the hunter needs to make a catch every day

28
0:1:3,82 --> 0:1:4,84
Otherwise, they would go hungry.

29
0:1:4,84 --> 0:1:6,3
But farmers, however,

30
0:1:6,3 --> 0:1:9,71
they can endure a period of hunger and poverty.

31
0:1:9,71 --> 0:1:12,92
They can prepare in advance for the harvest of the year.

32
0:1:12,92 --> 0:1:15,76
So, what evolved first in humans?

33
0:1:15,76 --> 0:1:16,76
What came later?

34
0:1:16,76 --> 0:1:18,36
There would be different traits.

35
0:1:18,36 --> 0:1:20,3
Some people, for instance, are naturally prone to anxiety.

36
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:22,26
They might feel they haven’t accomplished much today.

37
0:1:22,26 --> 0:1:23,4
He will feel upset

38
0:1:23,4 --> 0:1:26,76
So you need large-scale self-deception

39
0:1:26,76 --> 0:1:29,32
When it comes to many things in life

40
0:1:29,32 --> 0:1:31,85
The reason I keep telling everyone

41
0:1:31,85 --> 0:1:34,57
This large-scale, high-intensity self-deception is crucial

42
0:1:34,57 --> 0:1:37,21
Is because in modern society

43
0:1:37,21 --> 0:1:39,13
Many things due to a lack of resources

44
0:1:39,13 --> 0:1:42,9
Due to the dynamics of interpersonal relationships and social status

45
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:46,36
Often you can't mobilize a lot of resources

46
0:1:46,36 --> 0:1:47,46
At this point

47
0:1:47,46 --> 0:1:48,62
you need to remind yourself

48
0:1:48,62 --> 0:1:49,88
what is abundant

49
0:1:49,88 --> 0:1:51,78
and what can be postponed

50
0:1:51,78 --> 0:1:53,42
If you adopt a hunter’s mindset

51
0:1:53,42 --> 0:1:55,56
you’ll start worrying about what you can’t get today

52
0:1:55,56 --> 0:1:56,78
I want to mate

53
0:1:56,78 --> 0:1:57,92
I need to find someone quickly

54
0:1:57,92 --> 0:1:58,68
I want to eat

55
0:1:58,68 --> 0:2:0,82
I have to hunt a lion.

56
0:2:0,82 --> 0:2:1,8
How can we put that?

57
0:2:1,8 --> 0:2:3,77
This has a probability of success.

58
0:2:3,77 --> 0:2:4,97
From a hunter's perspective,

59
0:2:4,97 --> 0:2:7,81
it's more about something found in the search process.

60
0:2:7,81 --> 0:2:9,59
Many psychologists would advise you to

61
0:2:9,59 --> 0:2:11,589
think like a farmer,

62
0:2:11,589 --> 0:2:14,89
to know when to store seeds like a farmer,

63
0:2:14,89 --> 0:2:16,509
and to know when to sow and reap like a farmer.

64
0:2:16,509 --> 0:2:18,349
After the clouds clear, the moon will shine.

65
0:2:18,349 --> 0:2:20,36
But at this point, you need to think the other way around.

66
0:2:20,36 --> 0:2:23,38
Why can't I act like a hunter and leave after a single job?

67
0:2:23,38 --> 0:2:24,4
In many cases,

68
0:2:24,4 --> 0:2:27,75
thieves and bandits essentially emerge in the same way.

69
0:2:27,75 --> 0:2:29,91
But when it comes to merchants,

70
0:2:29,91 --> 0:2:30,87
it's a more modern concept.

71
0:2:30,87 --> 0:2:32,51
With the advent of currency,

72
0:2:32,51 --> 0:2:33,57
markets came into being.

73
0:2:33,57 --> 0:2:36,94
You'll find in this crowd

74
0:2:36,94 --> 0:2:38,94
which professions have evolved more recently

75
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:40,46
are better adapted to modern society

76
0:2:40,46 --> 0:2:43,34
just like blood types A, B, AB, and O

77
0:2:43,34 --> 0:2:45,1
AB being the most recently evolved

78
0:2:45,1 --> 0:2:47,22
so a lot of things you have to look at the development of humanity

79
0:2:47,22 --> 0:2:48,34
daily activities

80
0:2:48,34 --> 0:2:49,5
and how they gradually transformed

81
0:2:49,5 --> 0:2:50,18
so I'm telling you

82
0:2:50,18 --> 0:2:52,35
The business books written by Jews

83
0:2:52,35 --> 0:2:53,59
you must read them

84
0:2:53,59 --> 0:2:55,71
The reason Jews are disliked

85
0:2:55,71 --> 0:2:57,45
is because, well

86
0:2:57,45 --> 0:3:0,879
the things they do poorly

87
0:3:0,879 --> 0:3:1,799
you don’t need to learn

88
0:3:1,799 --> 0:3:3,479
since you don’t have their flaws

89
0:3:3,479 --> 0:3:4,799
but the good things they do

90
0:3:4,799 --> 0:3:5,99
you can learn from them

91
0:3:5,99 --> 0:3:8,47
To put it bluntly, in today's world,

92
0:3:8,47 --> 0:3:10,93
what truly controls the world are these financial systems,

93
0:3:10,93 --> 0:3:12,95
and when it comes to these financial systems,

94
0:3:12,95 --> 0:3:14,64
it's the tangible merchants who hold the power,

95
0:3:14,64 --> 0:3:16,56
for example, if you can handle the abstract side of things,

96
0:3:16,56 --> 0:3:17,76
then go for the abstract side,

97
0:3:17,76 --> 0:3:18,44
if you can't do the abstract,

98
0:3:18,44 --> 0:3:19,12
then focus on the concrete side,

99
0:3:19,12 --> 0:3:20,7
this is always an option.

100
0:3:20,7 --> 0:3:21,92
In this era,

101
0:3:21,92 --> 0:3:24,86
all the smartest or the most cunning people,

102
0:3:24,86 --> 0:3:26,78
they are concentrated in the financial sector.

103
0:3:26,78 --> 0:3:28,5
You have to believe this.

104
0:3:28,5 --> 0:3:32,1
They are the ones who can quickly seize arbitrage opportunities.

105
0:3:32,1 --> 0:3:34,13
But what about ordinary people?

106
0:3:34,13 --> 0:3:36,49
Ordinary people tend to follow a principle of merchants,

107
0:3:36,49 --> 0:3:38,5
which is to look at things from a distance and up close.

108
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:40,7
The farther away something is, the more it tends to be considered.

109
0:3:40,7 --> 0:3:42,5
The more you rely on the internet,

110
0:3:42,5 --> 0:3:43,73
when it comes to things nearby,

111
0:3:43,73 --> 0:3:44,91
you can depend on opening a store,

112
0:3:44,91 --> 0:3:45,85
all sorts of things,

113
0:3:45,85 --> 0:3:46,73
so to speak,

114
0:3:46,73 --> 0:3:48,63
modern people need to have a competitive edge,

115
0:3:48,63 --> 0:3:51,72
merchants don’t get up early unless there’s profit to be made,

116
0:3:51,72 --> 0:3:55,1
merchants adjust their strategies based on others' needs,

117
0:3:55,1 --> 0:3:56,72
that is to say, the skills you possess

118
0:3:56,72 --> 0:3:58,4
The industry you're in

119
0:3:58,4 --> 0:3:59,36
don't pigeonhole yourself

120
0:3:59,36 --> 0:4:1,29
always maintain a learning mindset

121
0:4:1,29 --> 0:4:3,79
constantly explore new fields

122
0:4:3,79 --> 0:4:6,3
observe how demands evolve

123
0:4:6,3 --> 0:4:7,57
and take action accordingly

124
0:4:7,57 --> 0:4:10,299
like many people now are starting deep tech ventures

125
0:4:10,299 --> 0:4:11,719
writing books on these topics

126
0:4:11,719 --> 0:4:13,19
or launching these training camps

127
0:4:13,19 --> 0:4:14,93
What specific great use is there?

128
0:4:14,93 --> 0:4:16,1
There isn't really any significant use.

129
0:4:16,1 --> 0:4:18,39
He noticed this growing demand.

130
0:4:18,39 --> 0:4:19,73
And he suddenly stepped forward.

131
0:4:19,73 --> 0:4:21,1
So all of this,

132
0:4:21,1 --> 0:4:22,77
is a response to the changing market needs.

133
0:4:22,77 --> 0:4:24,49
This is the greatest quality of a businessman.

134
0:4:24,49 --> 0:4:25,63
He will constantly adapt.

135
0:4:25,63 --> 0:4:28,11
While a farmer will work towards a fixed goal.

136
0:4:28,11 --> 0:4:30,31
So once his goals are set

137
0:4:30,31 --> 0:4:31,19
others can predict him easily

138
0:4:31,19 --> 0:4:34,3
he’s better off assessing and then shorting him

139
0:4:34,3 --> 0:4:35,76
or taking advantage of his predictable moves

140
0:4:35,76 --> 0:4:37,8
So for a farmer

141
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:38,84
in the context of modern society

142
0:4:38,84 --> 0:4:40,44
this mindset works

143
0:4:40,44 --> 0:4:42,1
it means setting long-term goals

144
0:4:42,1 --> 0:4:43,86
unlike a hunter who tends to be more short-sighted

145
0:4:43,86 --> 0:4:46,46
But from many strategic perspectives

146
0:4:46,46 --> 0:4:47,82
we need to go back and forth

147
0:4:47,82 --> 0:4:48,3
we need to be flexible

148
0:4:48,3 --> 0:4:50,27
if you're going to take drastic measures, you need to think like it

149
0:4:50,27 --> 0:4:52,47
the most important aspect of a businessman's mindset is that

150
0:4:52,47 --> 0:4:52,99
let it go

151
0:4:52,99 --> 0:4:53,84
don't mention it

152
0:4:53,84 --> 0:4:55,92
many people will tell you to value integrity

153
0:4:55,92 --> 0:4:57,84
to pay attention to all sorts of unnecessary things

154
0:4:57,84 --> 0:5:0,12
When integrity no longer satisfies you,

155
0:5:0,12 --> 0:5:2,9
When the contract you've set doesn't quite fit your needs,

156
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:4,46
You should go ahead and break it if necessary,

157
0:5:4,46 --> 0:5:5,78
There are various ways,

158
0:5:5,78 --> 0:5:7,2
To help you make changes,

159
0:5:7,2 --> 0:5:8,1
To retract your decision,

160
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:9,1
Often things work out this way,

161
0:5:9,1 --> 0:5:10,97
Because business is always evolving,

162
0:5:10,97 --> 0:5:12,59
Once you see the benefit,

163
0:5:12,59 --> 0:5:13,81
It no longer belongs to you.

164
0:5:13,81 --> 0:5:16,17
The benefits from this thing are no longer on your side.

165
0:5:16,17 --> 0:5:17,59
You need to adapt when it's necessary.

166
0:5:17,59 --> 0:5:19,11
You can't cling to outdated methods.

167
0:5:19,11 --> 0:5:21,94
In this case, it's crucial to cut your losses in time.

168
0:5:21,94 --> 0:5:24,3
So, the evolution of modern human society,

169
0:5:24,3 --> 0:5:28,84
from hunters millions of years ago to farmers tens of thousands of years ago,

170
0:5:28,84 --> 0:5:30,2
and finally to merchants,

171
0:5:30,2 --> 0:5:32,44
you must understand how this should be done.

172
0:5:32,44 --> 0:5:36,8
The longer a person stays in a particular position on the evolutionary chain,

173
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:37,2
the longer they stay,

174
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:37,86
the deeper they go,

175
0:5:37,86 --> 0:5:40,58
the higher their status in human society becomes.

176
0:5:40,58 --> 0:5:41,54
That's why we often say,

177
0:5:41,54 --> 0:5:42,66
sometimes it's a matter of mindset,

178
0:5:42,66 --> 0:5:44,35
a mentality issue.

179
0:5:44,35 --> 0:5:45,91
When your cognitive level rises,

180
0:5:45,91 --> 0:5:47,7
naturally, other things will follow suit.

181
0:5:47,7 --> 0:5:49,37
This is just one way to solve the problem.

182
0:5:49,37 --> 0:5:53,28
Most Chinese parents teach you the mindset of an employee,

183
0:5:53,28 --> 0:5:54,74
which is also the mindset of a farmer.

184
0:5:54,74 --> 0:5:55,78
Endure hardship upon hardship,

185
0:5:55,78 --> 0:5:56,6
and you'll stand out among the few.

186
0:5:56,6 --> 0:5:58,96
So they keep giving you more hardships to endure,

187
0:5:58,96 --> 0:5:59,32
right?

188
0:5:59,32 --> 0:6:0,36
Who asked you to enjoy it?
