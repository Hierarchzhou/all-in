0:0:0,42 --> 0:0:2,4
Sigh, here’s a new chat episode

2
0:0:2,4 --> 0:0:4,74
This time, I’ll show you my books

3
0:0:4,74 --> 0:0:7,53
My books have already been printed

4
0:0:7,53 --> 0:0:9,45
Guess which one is the first edition

5
0:0:9,45 --> 0:0:10,51
This one is the first edition

6
0:0:10,51 --> 0:0:11,17
The first edition

7
0:0:11,17 --> 0:0:12,37
This is the second edition

8
0:0:12,37 --> 0:0:14,33
Speaking of the first edition

9
0:0:14,33 --> 0:0:15,81
It’s relatively thinner

10
0:0:15,81 --> 0:0:18,41
But how do we describe the content inside?

11
0:0:18,41 --> 0:0:22,24
Actually, this is the only one that hasn't been revised.

12
0:0:22,24 --> 0:0:23,26
Most of the original manuscripts,

13
0:0:23,26 --> 0:0:23,84
Of course,

14
0:0:23,84 --> 0:0:26,43
This can't be sold outside.

15
0:0:26,43 --> 0:0:28,67
The second one here is already,

16
0:0:28,67 --> 0:0:30,15
Look, the cover is in excellent condition,

17
0:0:30,15 --> 0:0:31,55
And it's very thick and sturdy,

18
0:0:31,55 --> 0:0:33,75
And it has a great feel to it.

19
0:0:33,75 --> 0:0:36,54
And then there's the special edition with the gold edges.

20
0:0:36,54 --> 0:0:38,26
That one is a limited release.

21
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:39,22
Only about

22
0:0:39,22 --> 0:0:41,37
I remember it should be around 1,000 copies.

23
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:45,21
So everyone, come to Shandong Book City on the 19th.

24
0:0:45,21 --> 0:0:46,71
I'll be there with my signed editions.

25
0:0:46,71 --> 0:0:48,37
The signed editions are also available online,

26
0:0:48,37 --> 0:0:50,17
but at the event, it’s guaranteed

27
0:0:50,17 --> 0:0:51,29
that you’ll get a signed copy.

28
0:0:51,29 --> 0:0:53,87
I think he's about to exhaust himself with all the signing.

29
0:0:53,87 --> 0:0:57,55
Yeah, it's the first book of the 'Life Hacks for B' series.

30
0:0:57,55 --> 0:0:58,63
I have three books.

31
0:0:58,63 --> 0:0:59,91
The third one hasn't even started yet.

32
0:0:59,91 --> 0:1:1,23
The second one is already finalized.

33
0:1:1,23 --> 0:1:2,9
The first one has already been published.

34
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:4,54
Everyone is welcome to buy them.

35
0:1:4,54 --> 0:1:5,74
They are very suitable.

36
0:1:5,74 --> 0:1:9,39
You can start watching in the Douyin Live from April 19th.

37
0:1:9,39 --> 0:1:11,39
You can buy it directly in Bilibili's live room.

38
0:1:11,39 --> 0:1:12,259
You can buy it directly.

39
0:1:12,259 --> 0:1:14,9
They are Douyin Store and this one.

40
0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:20,4
This is Taobao.

41
0:1:20,4 --> 0:1:25,4
The book won't be available in electronic format for a while.

42
0:1:25,4 --> 0:1:26,8
I hope everyone allows me to sell it for a while.

43
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:27,72
We'll talk about it after some time.

44
0:1:27,72 --> 0:1:28,4
I am a student.

45
0:1:28,4 --> 0:1:30,26
It's not expensive.

46
0:1:30,26 --> 0:1:31,42
It's just a few dozen bucks

47
0:1:31,42 --> 0:1:32,18
the cost of a meal

48
0:1:32,18 --> 0:1:33,28
what you'd spend on takeout

49
0:1:33,28 --> 0:1:38,26
and it will probably take about a year before it's available

50
0:1:38,26 --> 0:1:40,26
things like WeChat Reading

51
0:1:40,26 --> 0:1:43,46
my editor summarized this for me

52
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:46,459
how should I put it

53
0:1:46,459 --> 0:1:49,83
uh

54
0:1:49,83 --> 0:1:51,75
what my book is mainly about

55
0:1:51,75 --> 0:1:53,23
Since I've been writing for quite a while

56
0:1:53,23 --> 0:1:54,51
I'm a bit forgetful now

57
0:1:54,51 --> 0:1:56,91
Let me summarize for everyone

58
0:1:56,91 --> 0:2:0,37
Rong Zhen's grand life strategy for young friends

59
0:2:0,37 --> 0:2:3,9
Break through with courage and avoid pitfalls with wisdom

60
0:2:3,9 --> 0:2:5,11
Don't let others' expectations become your chains

61
0:2:5,11 --> 0:2:6,79
Time will unlock confusion

62
0:2:6,79 --> 0:2:8,759
Wisdom can help you avoid pitfalls and provide a safety net

63
0:2:8,759 --> 0:2:9,879
Instead of worrying about the future

64
0:2:9,879 --> 0:2:10,959
Focus on the present instead.

65
0:2:10,959 --> 0:2:13,65
What once made you stumble will eventually become the path beneath your feet.

66
0:2:13,65 --> 0:2:16,39
In families, understanding each other is more important than confrontation.

67
0:2:16,39 --> 0:2:17,65
Actually, in many cases,

68
0:2:17,65 --> 0:2:19,15
when we talk about life,

69
0:2:19,15 --> 0:2:23,24
drawing from my personal experience,

70
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:24,82
back when I was in my twenties,

71
0:2:24,82 --> 0:2:26,56
the mistakes I made in my thirties,

72
0:2:26,56 --> 0:2:28,83
are pretty much all included here.

73
0:2:28,83 --> 0:2:30,11
When it comes to emotions,

74
0:2:30,11 --> 0:2:30,77
social aspects,

75
0:2:30,77 --> 0:2:31,63
economic factors,

76
0:2:31,63 --> 0:2:32,73
career paths,

77
0:2:32,73 --> 0:2:34,15
and choices in education,

78
0:2:34,15 --> 0:2:35,7
they're all covered.

79
0:2:35,7 --> 0:2:37,89
I think most things,

80
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:40,98
can be considered part of general education,

81
0:2:40,98 --> 0:2:44,58
but often, you know what something is without understanding why it is that way.

82
0:2:44,58 --> 0:2:45,58
Some things, when broken down,

83
0:2:45,58 --> 0:2:46,18
when thoroughly examined,

84
0:2:46,18 --> 0:2:48,55
they might reveal a deeper meaning.

85
0:2:48,55 --> 0:2:52,59
Actually, many of life's pitfalls are hard to escape once you fall into them.

86
0:2:52,59 --> 0:2:56,46
But, to put it another way, it's about a shift in consciousness.

87
0:2:56,46 --> 0:2:58,78
If you had met me earlier,

88
0:2:58,78 --> 0:3:0,26
or watched my videos a few years ago,

89
0:3:0,26 --> 0:3:2,74
your entire perception of life might have been different.

90
0:3:2,74 --> 0:3:5,86
I hope everyone's journey through life is smooth and clear.

91
0:3:5,86 --> 0:3:6,82
Smooth sailing

92
0:3:6,82 --> 0:3:10,45
You don’t have to walk as cautiously as I did

93
0:3:10,45 --> 0:3:11,99
Feeling your way across the river by touching the stones

94
0:3:11,99 --> 0:3:13,9
It’s hard to put into words

95
0:3:13,9 --> 0:3:14,45
It’s entirely

96
0:3:14,45 --> 0:3:16,53
Back then, I wished that my future self, 20 years from now

97
0:3:16,53 --> 0:3:19,3
Could guide me through my confusion

98
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:20,629
Give me a book like this

99
0:3:20,629 --> 0:3:22,97
I think it would be a really great thing

100
0:3:22,97 --> 0:3:24,87
There's no need to say anything more.

101
0:3:24,87 --> 0:3:25,33
Bro Rong,

102
0:3:25,33 --> 0:3:28,33
What's the difference between this video and the book?

103
0:3:28,33 --> 0:3:31,5
Let me tell you, the content of the book is more classical.

104
0:3:31,5 --> 0:3:32,715
More formal, actually.

105
0:3:32,73 --> 0:3:35,33
But it's still very enjoyable to read.

106
0:3:35,33 --> 0:3:36,69
And you can give the book as a gift to your friends.

107
0:3:36,69 --> 0:3:38,29
You can even use it to enlighten your parents.

108
0:3:38,29 --> 0:3:40,329
This is really important.

109
0:3:40,329 --> 0:3:41,449
When it comes to videos

110
0:3:41,449 --> 0:3:43,89
Speaking of these over a thousand videos

111
0:3:43,89 --> 0:3:44,129
After everyone has finished watching them all

112
0:3:44,129 --> 0:3:45,849
The focus is on these three books of mine

113
0:3:45,849 --> 0:3:47,16
Actually, it's pretty good

114
0:3:47,16 --> 0:3:49,8
There's quite a bit of chatter in my videos

115
0:3:49,8 --> 0:3:50,96
The content in the books is more concise

116
0:3:50,96 --> 0:3:53,1
So it's actually great to buy them and keep as favorites

117
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:53,96
They are really excellent

118
0:3:53,96 --> 0:3:56,17
Bro Long will personally sign ten sentences for you.

119
0:3:56,17 --> 0:3:58,9
Now, let's talk about the topic of this episode.

120
0:3:58,9 --> 0:3:59,69
Let's dive into the topic of this episode.

121
0:3:59,69 --> 0:4:3,75
Many people say that what you're talking about is Western philosophy.

122
0:4:3,75 --> 0:4:4,91
Actually, it's not Western philosophy.

123
0:4:4,91 --> 0:4:6,99
A lot of what I talk about is the philosophy of Laozi and Zhuangzi.

124
0:4:6,99 --> 0:4:8,23
The ideas of Wang Yangming as well.

125
0:4:8,23 --> 0:4:10,86
First, let's talk about Zhuangzi.

126
0:4:10,86 --> 0:4:12,44
He talked about this person.

127
0:4:12,44 --> 0:4:16,38
So, what exactly can one do to avoid depression?

128
0:4:16,38 --> 0:4:18,37
Why do so many people suffer from depression?

129
0:4:18,37 --> 0:4:20,289
Zhuangzi didn’t specify.

130
0:4:20,289 --> 0:4:22,429
He didn’t go into detail about how to avoid it.

131
0:4:22,429 --> 0:4:24,889
You might first feel very, very down.

132
0:4:24,889 --> 0:4:27,21
Or you might find yourself trapped in a state of anxiety.

133
0:4:27,21 --> 0:4:28,57
He gave an example.

134
0:4:28,57 --> 0:4:30,69
He mentioned the story of Bo Le recognizing a fine horse.

135
0:4:30,69 --> 0:4:32,37
He talked about how a horse meets its true connoisseur.

136
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:35,18
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

137
0:4:35,18 --> 0:4:37,28
A wise judge recognizes you as a thousand-mile horse.

138
0:4:37,28 --> 0:4:40,26
But what is the price you have to pay to become a thousand-mile horse?

139
0:4:40,26 --> 0:4:42,26
You need to be bridled.

140
0:4:42,26 --> 0:4:43,83
Put on this saddle.

141
0:4:43,83 --> 0:4:44,97
Shoe the horse.

142
0:4:44,97 --> 0:4:45,89
Burn off the mixed hairs.

143
0:4:45,89 --> 0:4:47,21
And even give you a good fanning.

144
0:4:47,21 --> 0:4:48,65
In many cases, speaking of which,

145
0:4:48,65 --> 0:4:51,17
A form of social persuasion

146
0:4:51,17 --> 0:4:55,46
Or the education system molds you into an excellent worker

147
0:4:55,46 --> 0:4:57,909
Society turns you into a useful person

148
0:4:57,909 --> 0:5:2,669
But this usefulness is from society's perspective, this excellence

149
0:5:2,669 --> 0:5:4,85
This is what society values

150
0:5:4,85 --> 0:5:6,99
It's specific to certain contexts

151
0:5:6,99 --> 0:5:9,77
But what about you, from the perspective of Laozi and Zhuangzi's philosophy

152
0:5:9,77 --> 0:5:11,65
From the perspective of Daoist philosophy

153
0:5:11,65 --> 0:5:15,41
Valuing tranquility and non-action, becoming one with nature

154
0:5:15,41 --> 0:5:19,939
So, a lot of the time, it's about showing respect to heaven and earth.

155
0:5:19,939 --> 0:5:22,179
First, how do we talk about the unity of heaven and humanity?

156
0:5:22,179 --> 0:5:23,88
This is the realm that Taoism strives to achieve.

157
0:5:23,88 --> 0:5:25,78
Ultimately, to live as a natural being.

158
0:5:25,78 --> 0:5:27,22
To breathe with the earth.

159
0:5:27,22 --> 0:5:28,14
To share its fate.

160
0:5:28,14 --> 0:5:29,7
Often, when we talk about it,

161
0:5:29,7 --> 0:5:31,3
If you follow the way of heaven,

162
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:32,18
and the way of the earth.

163
0:5:32,18 --> 0:5:33,78
Old Beijing is truly authentic.

164
0:5:33,78 --> 0:5:37,71
If you follow the way of heaven and earth, the way of nature,

165
0:5:37,71 --> 0:5:38,55
In many aspects,

166
0:5:38,55 --> 0:5:40,37
the advice in human society,

167
0:5:40,37 --> 0:5:41,91
those norms and rituals,

168
0:5:41,91 --> 0:5:43,95
can make you feel particularly uncomfortable.

169
0:5:43,95 --> 0:5:47,7
Actually, the main core reason for your depression,

170
0:5:47,7 --> 0:5:51,38
is also the way they cultivate you as a talent,

171
0:5:51,38 --> 0:5:54,73
I often say the education system treats us like scientists.

172
0:5:54,73 --> 0:5:56,63
Engineers are selected

173
0:5:56,63 --> 0:6:2,7
The main goal of modern education isn't to cultivate just anyone

174
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:4,42
We talk about vocational education

175
0:6:4,42 --> 0:6:6,36
We need to provide targeted training

176
0:6:6,36 --> 0:6:7,6
We need to offer differentiated training

177
0:6:7,6 --> 0:6:8,92
In many cases

178
0:6:8,92 --> 0:6:12,68
Many people don't engage in research at universities

179
0:6:12,68 --> 0:6:14,73
There's no need for them to attend high school

180
0:6:14,73 --> 0:6:16,77
Many people mention vocational education in middle school

181
0:6:16,77 --> 0:6:18,5
So, let's talk about it now.

182
0:6:18,5 --> 0:6:20,73
You see, for the undergraduate program in directing,

183
0:6:20,73 --> 0:6:21,49
and the acting program,

184
0:6:21,49 --> 0:6:22,68
what we learn in these courses,

185
0:6:22,68 --> 0:6:24,28
is also part of the undergraduate curriculum.

186
0:6:24,28 --> 0:6:26,48
But I actually think the content of the acting program

187
0:6:26,48 --> 0:6:28,77
should be taught in high school,

188
0:6:28,77 --> 0:6:30,99
when people are young and full of energy,

189
0:6:30,99 --> 0:6:32,49
and their hormones are really surging.

190
0:6:32,49 --> 0:6:33,57
She looks great

191
0:6:33,57 --> 0:6:34,74
and is full of energy

192
0:6:34,74 --> 0:6:37,56
probably during junior and senior high school

193
0:6:37,56 --> 0:6:40,8
if you aspire to be a dance student

194
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:41,22
a vocal student

195
0:6:41,22 --> 0:6:42,12
an art student

196
0:6:42,12 --> 0:6:43,14
or a performance student

197
0:6:43,14 --> 0:6:43,8
how about we

198
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:45,1
I am a media voice

199
0:6:45,1 --> 0:6:47,79
You should cultivate vocational education during high school.

200
0:6:47,79 --> 0:6:50,31
Then, directly attend a junior college in the university stage.

201
0:6:50,31 --> 0:6:51,62
That's it after attending a higher vocational school.

202
0:6:51,62 --> 0:6:52,54
We talk about

203
0:6:52,54 --> 0:6:55,46
We also mention that those art schools have higher vocational accompaniment junior college classes.

204
0:6:55,46 --> 0:6:57,16
But let's be honest here,

205
0:6:57,16 --> 0:7:0,47
It's crucial to provide general scientific literacy education.

206
0:7:0,47 --> 0:7:4,39
We believe humans should possess basic scientific literacy,

207
0:7:4,39 --> 0:7:4,95
in this regard.

208
0:7:4,95 --> 0:7:6,55
It pertains to the core of modern civilization.

209
0:7:6,55 --> 0:7:10,729
This is a key factor in understanding it.

210
0:7:10,729 --> 0:7:12,669
Of course, if you have the capacity to learn further.

211
0:7:12,669 --> 0:7:14,62
If studying isn't too strenuous for you.

212
0:7:14,62 --> 0:7:15,66
You can complete high school.

213
0:7:15,66 --> 0:7:16,9
You can go on to a regular undergraduate program.

214
0:7:16,9 --> 0:7:19,6
It would actually be beneficial for you.

215
0:7:19,6 --> 0:7:21,22
Of course, for many professions.

216
0:7:21,22 --> 0:7:22,1
He mentions cooking.

217
0:7:22,1 --> 0:7:23,34
I should have started learning in junior high school.

218
0:7:23,34 --> 0:7:23,78
Right?

219
0:7:23,78 --> 0:7:25,169
When it comes to many things,

220
0:7:25,169 --> 0:7:29,209
wasting time in high school, college, and graduate school,

221
0:7:29,209 --> 0:7:30,889
it might not be as beneficial for your career development,

222
0:7:30,889 --> 0:7:32,87
there might not be as many benefits.

223
0:7:32,87 --> 0:7:35,35
That's why I always advise people to make the most of their resources,

224
0:7:35,35 --> 0:7:36,28
to use them to their fullest extent.

225
0:7:36,28 --> 0:7:38,72
Think about what direction you want to develop in.

226
0:7:38,72 --> 0:7:40,94
Does the education system really help you?

227
0:7:40,94 --> 0:7:44,95
Does preparing for civil service exams or postgraduate studies really provide positive guidance?

228
0:7:44,95 --> 0:7:47,79
So, you must think carefully about what modern education is.

229
0:7:47,79 --> 0:7:48,99
You also need to consider this clearly.

230
0:7:48,99 --> 0:7:50,15
So, in many cases,

231
0:7:50,15 --> 0:7:53,12
If someone is becoming increasingly depressed,

232
0:7:53,12 --> 0:7:55,22
Is it because you're putting too much pressure on yourself?

233
0:7:55,22 --> 0:7:58,68
There's more and more self-imposed social conditioning.

234
0:7:58,68 --> 0:7:59,7
It's becoming more and more prevalent.

235
0:7:59,7 --> 0:8:2,13
Life has no referees.

236
0:8:2,13 --> 0:8:3,99
You decide how you should live.

237
0:8:3,99 --> 0:8:5,5
You determine your own path.

238
0:8:5,5 --> 0:8:5,73
Parental wishes.

239
0:8:5,73 --> 0:8:6,37
Matchmaker's words.

240
0:8:6,37 --> 0:8:8,49
I'll dedicate an episode to it in a couple of days.

241
0:8:8,49 --> 0:8:11,7
Criticizing the Disciple's Rules.

242
0:8:11,7 --> 0:8:12,27
I am against Confucianism.

243
0:8:12,27 --> 0:8:15,93
However, I don't deny the historical contributions of Confucius.

244
0:8:15,93 --> 0:8:19,73
But I hate how some people in later generations exploit Confucianism

245
0:8:19,73 --> 0:8:20,79
exploit these ideas

246
0:8:20,79 --> 0:8:24,57
use these unnatural things to

247
0:8:24,57 --> 0:8:26,75
but what they call educating the people

248
0:8:26,75 --> 0:8:27,89
how do I put it

249
0:8:27,89 --> 0:8:31,8
I think it's more of a harm to the people

250
0:8:31,8 --> 0:8:33,84
but I believe in ancient philosophy

251
0:8:33,84 --> 0:8:35,59
I'm not saying we should tear everything down

252
0:8:35,59 --> 0:8:36,87
deny everything

253
0:8:36,87 --> 0:8:38,27
Even the ancestors of China wouldn't recognize it

254
0:8:38,27 --> 0:8:39,95
But I do recognize the patriarch of Taoism

255
0:8:39,95 --> 0:8:40,31
Right?

256
0:8:40,31 --> 0:8:41,79
So, when it comes to Taoist philosophy

257
0:8:41,79 --> 0:8:43,9
Regarding how people should conduct themselves in life

258
0:8:43,9 --> 0:8:44,82
What more can be said?

259
0:8:47,6 --> 0:8:48,18
When considering more aspects

260
0:8:48,18 --> 0:8:49,54
You need to follow the laws of nature

261
0:8:49,54 --> 0:8:50,74
What exactly are the laws of nature?

262
0:8:50,74 --> 0:8:51,42
It's physics

263
0:8:51,42 --> 0:8:52,16
Right?

264
0:8:52,16 --> 0:8:54,1
So, as a high school science student

265
0:8:54,1 --> 0:8:55,78
and then a college engineering student

266
0:8:55,78 --> 0:8:57,2
but my major was engineering

267
0:8:57,2 --> 0:8:58,24
so I'd like to share with everyone

268
0:8:58,24 --> 0:9:1,66
I mean, like the one we're about to build

269
0:9:1,66 --> 0:9:5,4
the nuclear fusion power plant in Jiangxi

270
0:9:5,4 --> 0:9:8,44
if you don't have a general scientific literacy

271
0:9:8,44 --> 0:9:11,9
You don't know what quantum mechanics is, right?

272
0:9:11,9 --> 0:9:13,21
And you also don't know what nuclear fusion reactions are, do you?

273
0:9:13,21 --> 0:9:14,5
You don't understand physics and chemistry,

274
0:9:14,5 --> 0:9:15,13
especially nuclear fusion reactions,

275
0:9:15,13 --> 0:9:15,41
right?

276
0:9:15,41 --> 0:9:17,73
You can't even talk about things like electricity if you don't understand them.

277
0:9:17,73 --> 0:9:18,85
So when it comes to many things,

278
0:9:18,85 --> 0:9:22,28
I think having a certain level of scientific literacy is necessary.

279
0:9:22,28 --> 0:9:24,4
Especially at this stage,

280
0:9:24,4 --> 0:9:27,94
In junior high school, physics covered electricity.

281
0:9:27,94 --> 0:9:28,74
It also covered mechanics.

282
0:9:28,74 --> 0:9:30,38
I think this is really great.

283
0:9:30,38 --> 0:9:31,88
When you're in junior high school,

284
0:9:31,88 --> 0:9:34,46
you learn physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and politics.

285
0:9:34,46 --> 0:9:37,1
Looking back now,

286
0:9:37,1 --> 0:9:38,41
it's still very necessary.

287
0:9:38,41 --> 0:9:40,29
But there's one more thing to say,

288
0:9:40,29 --> 0:9:41,95
which is that everyone should use their resources to the fullest.

289
0:9:41,95 --> 0:9:42,99
Make the best use of everything

290
0:9:42,99 --> 0:9:45,579
Those who start early should start even earlier

291
0:9:45,579 --> 0:9:47,619
How to put it, in terms of human

292
0:9:47,619 --> 0:9:49,619
The differentiation in the cultivation of specialties

293
0:9:49,619 --> 0:9:51,74
It's actually a form of protection for talent

294
0:9:51,74 --> 0:9:54,18
We won't beat around the bush

295
0:9:54,18 --> 0:9:55,56
What we mainly want to do is

296
0:9:55,56 --> 0:9:57,53
There are many times in life

297
0:9:57,53 --> 0:10:0,17
Obstacles that can't be avoided

298
0:10:0,17 --> 0:10:1,73
We might have to take some detours

299
0:10:1,73 --> 0:10:4,21
but there are ways to avoid certain pitfalls

300
0:10:4,21 --> 0:10:8,5
so we should try to steer clear of the traps we've discussed

301
0:10:8,5 --> 0:10:10,71
actually, in life, it's like this

302
0:10:10,71 --> 0:10:12,3
the chasm of faith

303
0:10:12,3 --> 0:10:13,86
the vast ocean of knowledge

304
0:10:13,86 --> 0:10:15,34
in a moment

305
0:10:15,34 --> 0:10:18,34
you might fall into a very deep abyss

306
0:10:18,34 --> 0:10:19,31
and be unable to climb out

307
0:10:19,31 --> 0:10:21,79
But all these things between lives

308
0:10:21,79 --> 0:10:23,63
If you base it on Wang Yangming's teachings

309
0:10:23,63 --> 0:10:25,47
You'll understand the principles of Mind Learning

310
0:10:25,47 --> 0:10:28,84
Many things are illusions created by the mind

311
0:10:28,84 --> 0:10:31,66
Not actual physical realities

312
0:10:31,66 --> 0:10:33,22
That is to say, our minds

313
0:10:33,22 --> 0:10:34,18
Some of our aspects

314
0:10:34,18 --> 0:10:35,6
Some of our aspirations

315
0:10:35,6 --> 0:10:37,42
Some of our shifts in thought

316
0:10:37,42 --> 0:10:39,61
Sometimes he can alter your physical reality.

317
0:10:39,61 --> 0:10:40,65
Things in the real world.

318
0:10:40,65 --> 0:10:42,53
You'll change how you feel.

319
0:10:42,53 --> 0:10:43,81
Often, when we talk about our feelings,

320
0:10:43,81 --> 0:10:45,3
Our emotional state,

321
0:10:45,3 --> 0:10:46,35
These aspects of ourselves,

322
0:10:46,35 --> 0:10:49,7
The mental anguish we endure in reality,

323
0:10:49,7 --> 0:10:49,93
Including the dreams you have,

324
0:10:49,93 --> 0:10:51,24
Including your subconscious.

325
0:10:51,24 --> 0:10:53,12
Including your daily perceptions

326
0:10:53,12 --> 0:10:55,52
Actually, they have a more direct impact on you

327
0:10:55,52 --> 0:10:57,84
So we say that in life

328
0:10:57,84 --> 0:11:1,2
The key is to get your underlying operating system right

329
0:11:1,2 --> 0:11:3,3
What is the purpose of your underlying operating system

330
0:11:3,3 --> 0:11:4,93
What are you fighting for

331
0:11:4,93 --> 0:11:8,53
What is the driving force that keeps you going every day

332
0:11:8,53 --> 0:11:9,71
The driving force that keeps me going every day

333
0:11:9,71 --> 0:11:11,15
Up to today

334
0:11:11,15 --> 0:11:13,31
If we're talking about the basics

335
0:11:13,31 --> 0:11:15,61
the deep-seated belief, what is it really?

336
0:11:18,84 --> 0:11:20,28
This is my ultimate belief

337
0:11:20,28 --> 0:11:21,3
Let's be honest

338
0:11:21,3 --> 0:11:23,4
whether you study mysticism

339
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:25,16
or various value systems

340
0:11:25,16 --> 0:11:26,65
or Machiavelli

341
0:11:26,65 --> 0:11:28,7
these all fall into the realm of philosophy

342
0:11:28,7 --> 0:11:32,86
the foundational thinking in political science

343
0:11:32,86 --> 0:11:35,66
As a means and strategy used in games

344
0:11:35,66 --> 0:11:37,21
it falls under strategy

345
0:11:37,21 --> 0:11:38,71
and this belief

346
0:11:38,71 --> 0:11:39,81
how should I put it

347
0:11:39,81 --> 0:11:42,13
it's different from the line code

348
0:11:42,13 --> 0:11:43,37
so when we talk about these things

349
0:11:43,37 --> 0:11:45,54
we're referring to our basic coding methods, right

350
0:11:45,54 --> 0:11:46,88
the original code

351
0:11:46,88 --> 0:11:48,26
these underlying source codes

352
0:11:48,26 --> 0:11:49,7
What's our underlying code?

353
0:11:49,7 --> 0:11:52,42
Our underlying code, in simple terms, is to Serve the People.

354
0:11:54,58 --> 0:11:56,2
To give back to society.

355
0:11:59,17 --> 0:12:0,81
It's very much about humanistic care.

356
0:12:0,81 --> 0:12:2,21
Many people didn't believe it when they were young.

357
0:12:2,21 --> 0:12:5,23
But after growing up and comparing China and the U.S.,

358
0:12:5,23 --> 0:12:9,52
they quickly understand that many things are realized through comparison.

359
0:12:9,52 --> 0:12:10,62
We are not perfect.

360
0:12:10,62 --> 0:12:12,32
We never claim to be perfect.

361
0:12:12,32 --> 0:12:16,3
But if you are part of certain vulnerable groups in society

362
0:12:16,3 --> 0:12:17,7
For example, speaking of myself

363
0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:19,9
I have people with disabilities around me

364
0:12:19,9 --> 0:12:24,409
And the disabled people around me have received particularly good care

365
0:12:24,409 --> 0:12:26,9
Moreover, quite often

366
0:12:26,9 --> 0:12:29,31
The social workers in our country

367
0:12:29,31 --> 0:12:31,85
As well as these rescue organizations in society

368
0:12:31,85 --> 0:12:34,69
And those involved in the government

369
0:12:34,69 --> 0:12:38,3
Such as the China Disabled Persons' Federation and others, do a very thorough job

370
0:12:38,3 --> 0:12:39,1
It's quite considerate

371
0:12:39,1 --> 0:12:39,31
person

372
0:12:39,31 --> 0:12:39,67
among them

373
0:12:39,67 --> 0:12:42,6
without being like some of those

374
0:12:42,6 --> 0:12:44,76
certain Fascist types in the West

375
0:12:44,76 --> 0:12:46,12
claiming they are not

376
0:12:46,12 --> 0:12:47,4
they don't think they are Fascist

377
0:12:47,4 --> 0:12:49,87
but in reality, they are very, how should I put it

378
0:12:49,87 --> 0:12:51,43
inhumane

379
0:12:51,43 --> 0:12:52,73
It's really hard to put into words

380
0:12:52,73 --> 0:12:54,97
It's Social Darwinism

381
0:12:54,97 --> 0:12:56,78
It's the law of the jungle

382
0:12:56,78 --> 0:12:57,82
Survival of the fittest

383
0:12:57,82 --> 0:13:0,72
Perhaps it is a real rule in many aspects of society

384
0:13:0,72 --> 0:13:4,31
But precisely because of the existence of such rules

385
0:13:4,31 --> 0:13:6,67
We need to do more to protect the weak

386
0:13:6,67 --> 0:13:8,39
To safeguard the interests of vulnerable groups

387
0:13:8,39 --> 0:13:12,18
For example, people are valuable because they are useful

388
0:13:12,18 --> 0:13:13,6
It's all about Utilitarianism

389
0:13:13,6 --> 0:13:14,829
Then what about left-behind children?

390
0:13:14,829 --> 0:13:16,869
And what about the elderly who live alone?

391
0:13:16,869 --> 0:13:18,409
They are all deemed useless to society.

392
0:13:18,409 --> 0:13:19,509
Then what is to be done?

393
0:13:19,509 --> 0:13:20,41
Right?

394
0:13:20,41 --> 0:13:21,37
So in many cases,

395
0:13:21,37 --> 0:13:23,77
People don't talk about things in life

396
0:13:23,77 --> 0:13:25,53
As if only the strong always prevail.

397
0:13:25,53 --> 0:13:28,3
It's always the utilitarian things that dominate.

398
0:13:28,3 --> 0:13:30,31
If you are someone who is primarily guided by utilitarianism,

399
0:13:30,31 --> 0:13:33,31
that is to say, if you don't apply Machiavellianism as a philosophy of struggle,

400
0:13:33,31 --> 0:13:35,12
but instead as a philosophy of life,

401
0:13:35,12 --> 0:13:36,7
then you would be making a huge mistake.

402
0:13:36,7 --> 0:13:38,2
In life, it's still better to align more with Wang Yangming,

403
0:13:38,2 --> 0:13:40,67
and keep the idea of serving the people close to your heart.

404
0:13:40,67 --> 0:13:44,11
Often, we talk about the three treasures and one struggle.

405
0:13:44,11 --> 0:13:48,45
Let's talk about the three treasures and one fight.

406
0:13:48,45 --> 0:13:49,15
Two treasures in conflict

407
0:13:49,15 --> 0:13:49,83
No matter what

408
0:13:49,83 --> 0:13:51,13
How many meals can you eat in a day?

409
0:13:51,13 --> 0:13:53,11
In your extravagant lifestyle

410
0:13:53,11 --> 0:13:55,18
You can't eat 15 eggs a day

411
0:13:55,18 --> 0:13:56,46
Human indulgence

412
0:13:56,46 --> 0:13:57,5
These human desires

413
0:13:57,5 --> 0:13:58,82
Gradually, they all have their limits

414
0:13:58,82 --> 0:14:0,98
Like me, my body is gradually not up to it

415
0:14:0,98 --> 0:14:2,94
What's the point of adding Xiao Mei to Little Sister?

416
0:14:2,94 --> 0:14:4,28
Your body just can't keep up, can it?

417
0:14:4,28 --> 0:14:4,829
Right?

418
0:14:4,829 --> 0:14:6,69
People have their natural laws.

419
0:14:6,69 --> 0:14:7,349
We age when it's time to age.

420
0:14:7,349 --> 0:14:8,749
A new generation is growing up.

421
0:14:8,749 --> 0:14:10,61
So how should you put it?

422
0:14:10,61 --> 0:14:12,43
You need to follow the laws of nature.

423
0:14:14,76 --> 0:14:17,48
So, fundamentally, we have this greater purpose to consider.

424
0:14:17,48 --> 0:14:18,78
What is the essence of righteousness?

425
0:14:20,77 --> 0:14:22,3
To protect the Earth's environment

426
0:14:22,3 --> 0:14:23,75
To genuinely love our home

427
0:14:23,75 --> 0:14:25,73
Our nature is crucial

428
0:14:25,73 --> 0:14:28,319
So there are many things we can do in life

429
0:14:28,319 --> 0:14:29,799
There are many things we can do

430
0:14:29,799 --> 0:14:31,919
So I talk to our gloomy ones

431
0:14:31,919 --> 0:14:34,31
I tell these gloomy friends

432
0:14:34,31 --> 0:14:37,75
Encouraging you to integrate into society is also a method

433
0:14:37,75 --> 0:14:41,93
But ultimately, you are the one who shapes yourself.

434
0:14:41,93 --> 0:14:43,23
Not your parents,

435
0:14:43,23 --> 0:14:44,33
not society,

436
0:14:44,33 --> 0:14:45,38
but you yourself.

437
0:14:45,38 --> 0:14:48,66
What cause you dedicate your life to,

438
0:14:48,66 --> 0:14:51,6
what beliefs you hold dear,

439
0:14:51,6 --> 0:14:52,8
these are decisions you make.

440
0:14:52,8 --> 0:14:54,56
So, when it comes to you,

441
0:14:54,56 --> 0:14:55,76
in your youth,

442
0:14:55,76 --> 0:14:56,56
When you were in your teens

443
0:14:56,56 --> 0:14:56,96
In your twenties

444
0:14:56,96 --> 0:14:57,32
In your thirties

445
0:14:57,32 --> 0:14:58,1
And in your forties

446
0:14:58,1 --> 0:15:0,24
I can assure you, your perspectives will change

447
0:15:0,24 --> 0:15:1,839
Your life goals will also evolve

448
0:15:1,839 --> 0:15:4,599
You won’t keep walking down the same path forever

449
0:15:4,599 --> 0:15:6,63
So, take a look at this comprehensive life guide

450
0:15:6,63 --> 0:15:8,15
And explore the various paths available

451
0:15:8,15 --> 0:15:9,55
I'm not saying everyone has to learn

452
0:15:9,55 --> 0:15:11,9
What's there for me to learn?

453
0:15:11,9 --> 0:15:11,94
Right?

454
0:15:11,94 --> 0:15:13,66
What's there to learn from me?

455
0:15:13,66 --> 0:15:14,6
Middle-aged and divorced

456
0:15:14,6 --> 0:15:16,82
Taking care of a kid and two cats, right?

457
0:15:16,82 --> 0:15:17,88
A man with a kid and cats

458
0:15:17,88 --> 0:15:18,86
It's not like that

459
0:15:18,86 --> 0:15:20,1
A man with a kid and a love for cats

460
0:15:20,1 --> 0:15:20,78
Not really.

461
0:15:20,78 --> 0:15:23,38
No one can follow my exact path.

462
0:15:23,38 --> 0:15:25,58
But everyone’s journey is truly fascinating.

463
0:15:25,58 --> 0:15:26,66
A small change,

464
0:15:26,66 --> 0:15:28,42
and you alter everything that follows.

465
0:15:28,42 --> 0:15:29,72
But all roads lead to the same destination.

466
0:15:29,72 --> 0:15:31,0
In my view,

467
0:15:31,0 --> 0:15:33,16
the most crucial thing in life is to live with passion.

468
0:15:33,16 --> 0:15:34,4
To live happily.

469
0:15:34,4 --> 0:15:34,8
No matter what

470
0:15:34,8 --> 0:15:35,48
you need to remember

471
0:15:35,48 --> 0:15:37,0
you will definitely achieve your goal

472
0:15:37,0 --> 0:15:38,2
but what happens after you achieve it

473
0:15:38,2 --> 0:15:40,26
it might just be empty and boring

474
0:15:40,26 --> 0:15:42,86
anyway, I’ve fulfilled all my youthful dreams

475
0:15:42,86 --> 0:15:44,44
they’re all realized now

476
0:15:44,44 --> 0:15:45,82
a bit boring

477
0:15:45,82 --> 0:15:46,62
a bit empty

478
0:15:46,62 --> 0:15:49,2
So, life is about defining it yourself.

479
0:15:49,2 --> 0:15:52,44
It's about finding your own value and purpose.

480
0:15:52,44 --> 0:15:54,32
When you're young, one day,

481
0:15:54,32 --> 0:15:55,56
you'll finally find

482
0:15:55,56 --> 0:15:57,2
the value and meaning of your existence.

483
0:15:57,2 --> 0:15:59,65
At that moment, you'll experience a supreme joy,

484
0:15:59,65 --> 0:16:0,81
an incredible happiness.

485
0:16:0,81 --> 0:16:1,77
In life,

486
0:16:1,77 --> 0:16:5,73
I think, even though I also dream of being surrounded by beautiful people,

487
0:16:5,73 --> 0:16:7,1
I also want to live in a big house

488
0:16:7,1 --> 0:16:8,1
drive a big truck

489
0:16:8,1 --> 0:16:8,75
right?

490
0:16:8,75 --> 0:16:11,91
and then have 20 or 30 million followers, right?

491
0:16:11,91 --> 0:16:12,87
wouldn't that be great?

492
0:16:12,87 --> 0:16:13,37
right?

493
0:16:13,37 --> 0:16:15,75
but the luxury and excess in life

494
0:16:15,75 --> 0:16:17,12
human desires do have limits

495
0:16:17,12 --> 0:16:20,26
the more you take from society

496
0:16:20,26 --> 0:16:21,8
The less others get

497
0:16:21,8 --> 0:16:23,22
So in many cases

498
0:16:23,22 --> 0:16:26,42
If you can dedicate 10% of your life

499
0:16:26,42 --> 0:16:27,16
time and energy

500
0:16:27,16 --> 0:16:29,95
to think about the elderly without family

501
0:16:29,95 --> 0:16:32,33
think about disabled veterans

502
0:16:32,33 --> 0:16:35,69
think about the left-behind children

503
0:16:35,69 --> 0:16:36,53
Well

504
0:16:36,53 --> 0:16:38,49
many people need care in welfare homes

505
0:16:38,49 --> 0:16:39,69
children in welfare homes

506
0:16:39,69 --> 0:16:40,49
orphans, and such

507
0:16:40,49 --> 0:16:42,92
if you can spend 10% of your time

508
0:16:42,92 --> 0:16:44,4
10% of your energy

509
0:16:44,4 --> 0:16:45,92
you don’t need more, just think

510
0:16:45,92 --> 0:16:47,8
you should think about them

511
0:16:47,8 --> 0:16:49,71
just having them in your heart is enough

512
0:16:49,71 --> 0:16:50,63
it’s enough

513
0:16:50,63 --> 0:16:51,83
you would already be considered

514
0:16:51,83 --> 0:16:54,53
a very noble and good person

515
0:16:54,53 --> 0:16:57,45
Of course, in your daily life, there’s competition

516
0:16:57,45 --> 0:17:0,27
and conflict, and you need to compete

517
0:17:0,27 --> 0:17:1,97
use it or lose it, right?

518
0:17:1,97 --> 0:17:2,72
isn’t that so?

519
0:17:2,72 --> 0:17:5,46
these things like natural selection do exist

520
0:17:5,46 --> 0:17:5,68
I’m not

521
0:17:5,68 --> 0:17:8,94
I’m not denying the existence of competition in life

522
0:17:8,94 --> 0:17:10,7
that’s why I wrote this book

523
0:17:10,7 --> 0:17:11,66
to help you

524
0:17:11,66 --> 0:17:14,6
if you can, how to say, advance and seek fame, and if you retreat

525
0:17:14,6 --> 0:17:15,26
we can still be at peace with ourselves

526
0:17:15,26 --> 0:17:18,33
there are things in life that can’t be balanced

527
0:17:18,33 --> 0:17:21,15
not everything is

528
0:17:21,15 --> 0:17:23,4
a path to success

529
0:17:23,4 --> 0:17:24,12
there’s no science of success

530
0:17:24,12 --> 0:17:25,5
what is success?

531
0:17:25,5 --> 0:17:26,32
it’s all about your own definition

532
0:17:26,32 --> 0:17:27,67
so in life, there’s only a science of failure

533
0:17:27,67 --> 0:17:29,67
what is the science of failure?

534
0:17:29,67 --> 0:17:30,71
it’s about not losing your high aspirations when you fail

535
0:17:30,71 --> 0:17:32,139
rising from the fields in the morning

536
0:17:32,139 --> 0:17:33,539
and entering the imperial court by night

537
0:17:33,539 --> 0:17:34,299
what is this called?

538
0:17:34,299 --> 0:17:35,819
not losing your lofty ambitions

539
0:17:35,819 --> 0:17:36,619
rising from the humblest beginnings

540
0:17:36,619 --> 0:17:36,819
brightly

541
0:17:36,819 --> 0:17:37,639
ascending to the imperial hall

542
0:17:37,639 --> 0:17:39,16
in many cases

543
0:17:39,16 --> 0:17:43,31
you should think about what you should do

544
0:17:43,31 --> 0:17:44,63
when you’re lost

545
0:17:44,63 --> 0:17:46,73
when your parents may not have

546
0:17:46,73 --> 0:17:48,63
the foresight and wisdom

547
0:17:48,63 --> 0:17:50,63
and they might have a negative impact on you

548
0:17:50,63 --> 0:17:52,29
read this book by Brother Rong

549
0:17:52,29 --> 0:17:56,17
this book might just make your life a bit smoother

550
0:17:56,17 --> 0:17:58,19
make your life a bit happier

551
0:17:58,19 --> 0:17:59,11
it’s not expensive

552
0:17:59,11 --> 0:18:0,35
the cost of a KFC meal

553
0:18:0,35 --> 0:18:1,61
today, with VIVO50

554
0:18:1,61 --> 0:18:2,99
you can get it in your hands

555
0:18:2,99 --> 0:18:5,11
I’ll see you on the 19th

556
0:18:5,11 --> 0:18:6,6
bye
