1
0:0:0,3 --> 0:0:2,12
Hey everyone, hello!

2
0:0:2,12 --> 0:0:4,67
In this episode, I'll talk about three things.

3
0:0:4,67 --> 0:0:8,89
One is the dispute I had with the Xicheng Dama.

4
0:0:8,89 --> 0:0:11,45
Now she's called the Xicheng Dama.

5
0:0:11,45 --> 0:0:13,74
The court has already made its ruling.

6
0:0:13,74 --> 0:0:15,36
And I won the case.

7
0:0:15,36 --> 0:0:19,72
The second thing is my recent experience with buying a car.

8
0:0:19,72 --> 0:0:22,98
It really made me realize how difficult it is to own a car in Beijing.

9
0:0:22,98 --> 0:0:24,9
The third thing is closely related to all of you.

10
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:27,55
If you have a special skill right now,

11
0:0:27,55 --> 0:0:29,33
If you want to make some money with Brother Rong,

12
0:0:29,33 --> 0:0:30,77
we have a strategy.

13
0:0:30,77 --> 0:0:32,89
Let's start with the first topic.

14
0:0:32,89 --> 0:0:34,35
I won this case.

15
0:0:34,35 --> 0:0:39,36
The main reason for winning wasn't about being in the right.

16
0:0:39,36 --> 0:0:40,46
It's not about who is in the wrong.

17
0:0:40,46 --> 0:0:41,88
It's not a matter of who is at fault.

18
0:0:41,88 --> 0:0:42,8
Most importantly,

19
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:47,14
I think it's because I entrusted Captain Bai, our lawyer.

20
0:0:47,14 --> 0:0:50,44
It's about having professionals handle professional matters.

21
0:0:50,44 --> 0:0:51,94
When facing legal disputes

22
0:0:51,94 --> 0:0:53,28
Any kind of legal conflicts

23
0:0:53,28 --> 0:0:54,18
Reputation rights disputes

24
0:0:54,18 --> 0:0:55,209
Copyright disputes

25
0:0:55,209 --> 0:0:57,469
Or even some criminal cases

26
0:0:57,469 --> 0:0:58,809
Make sure you do

27
0:0:58,809 --> 0:1:1,92
You must spend money to hire a good lawyer

28
0:1:1,92 --> 0:1:3,48
This point is crucial

29
0:1:3,48 --> 0:1:6,86
Because you didn't study law

30
0:1:6,86 --> 0:1:9,9
You might lack the necessary experience

31
0:1:9,9 --> 0:1:12,4
Never go to court to represent yourself.

32
0:1:12,4 --> 0:1:13,54
When it comes to many of your aspects,

33
0:1:13,54 --> 0:1:16,48
they might seem very naive from the perspective of professional legal workers.

34
0:1:16,48 --> 0:1:18,4
So, a lot of things shouldn't be handled this way.

35
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:20,78
Regarding the details of the case,

36
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:22,5
I don't want to go into specifics.

37
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:24,6
Of course, I won the case.

38
0:1:24,6 --> 0:1:25,8
The other party has to pay compensation,

39
0:1:25,8 --> 0:1:26,4
and offer an apology.

40
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:27,5
Got to give this apology again

41
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:31,69
This is the very core content.

42
0:1:31,69 --> 0:1:33,85
Of course, the other party also has the right to appeal.

43
0:1:33,85 --> 0:1:34,87
By August 30th,

44
0:1:34,87 --> 0:1:35,91
if he doesn’t appeal again,

45
0:1:35,91 --> 0:1:37,539
the judgment will take effect.

46
0:1:37,539 --> 0:1:38,979
Regarding this case,

47
0:1:38,979 --> 0:1:40,99
I just want to make a few points.

48
0:1:40,99 --> 0:1:42,59
One is about cyber-bullying,

49
0:1:42,59 --> 0:1:45,1
which is something everyone detests.

50
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:46,16
Regardless of anything,

51
0:1:46,16 --> 0:1:48,3
No matter what your intentions are

52
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:50,78
exposing someone's private information online is wrong

53
0:1:50,78 --> 0:1:55,82
especially when it involves their family and financial status

54
0:1:55,82 --> 0:1:57,2
or the education of their children

55
0:1:57,2 --> 0:1:57,78
these matters

56
0:1:57,78 --> 0:1:59,32
are inherently illegal

57
0:1:59,32 --> 0:2:0,6
don't do it just because the other person is nice

58
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:2,54
for whatever reason

59
0:2:2,54 --> 0:2:3,54
no matter what you do

60
0:2:3,54 --> 0:2:6,62
if you feel that they are damaging your reputation

61
0:2:6,62 --> 0:2:7,94
You're spreading rumors or something?

62
0:2:7,94 --> 0:2:10,5
It's not about who shouts the loudest being right.

63
0:2:10,5 --> 0:2:12,95
Firstly, the illegal act came first, let's talk about that.

64
0:2:12,95 --> 0:2:16,69
He has also been the defendant in multiple similar defamation disputes.

65
0:2:16,69 --> 0:2:19,98
It's become a habit for him to do such things.

66
0:2:19,98 --> 0:2:21,66
As a cadre of a state-owned enterprise,

67
0:2:21,66 --> 0:2:22,88
He actually does such things?

68
0:2:22,88 --> 0:2:23,34
To be honest,

69
0:2:23,34 --> 0:2:25,6
Doing this could cost you your job.

70
0:2:25,6 --> 0:2:26,98
Of course, uh,

71
0:2:26,98 --> 0:2:30,23
Each person who filed the lawsuit had different demands.

72
0:2:30,23 --> 0:2:33,17
I just think that an apology from the other side would be enough.

73
0:2:33,17 --> 0:2:34,5
That’s all I need.

74
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:34,89
They can’t afford to pay compensation.

75
0:2:34,89 --> 0:2:37,7
But I’m still open to discussion.

76
0:2:37,7 --> 0:2:38,41
However, since the court has made its decision,

77
0:2:38,41 --> 0:2:39,57
we should firmly follow it.

78
0:2:39,57 --> 0:2:40,33
It’s a good outcome.

79
0:2:40,33 --> 0:2:42,58
He got what he deserved.

80
0:2:43,22 --> 0:2:44,14
Whoever is at fault, it’s not good.

81
0:2:44,14 --> 0:2:45,1
Na Fei called me

82
0:2:45,1 --> 0:2:46,14
What did he call me for?

83
0:2:46,14 --> 0:2:47,88
Am I the one you're really talking about?

84
0:2:47,88 --> 0:2:48,62
If you're willing

85
0:2:48,62 --> 0:2:50,62
Many people are unwilling to go to court

86
0:2:50,62 --> 0:2:53,1
It's hard to explain this thing

87
0:2:53,1 --> 0:2:54,56
As they say, family scandals should not be made public

88
0:2:54,56 --> 0:2:56,78
But it doesn't matter to someone like Brother Rong

89
0:2:56,78 --> 0:2:59,11
Because as an internet celebrity

90
0:2:59,11 --> 0:3:1,71
There's no such thing as personal privacy

91
0:3:1,71 --> 0:3:2,41
You need to say

92
0:3:2,41 --> 0:3:4,27
If you're going to put it bluntly

93
0:3:4,27 --> 0:3:6,35
Then let's talk about that specific incident

94
0:3:6,35 --> 0:3:7,87
Is there any event where this didn't happen?

95
0:3:7,87 --> 0:3:8,95
He just sticks to the facts

96
0:3:8,95 --> 0:3:9,63
and the evidence

97
0:3:9,63 --> 0:3:9,91
Right?

98
0:3:9,91 --> 0:3:12,5
You can't just make accusations without proof

99
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:13,7
and claim I did this or that

100
0:3:13,7 --> 0:3:13,95
and then expect me to accept it

101
0:3:13,95 --> 0:3:15,91
This kind of baseless attack

102
0:3:15,91 --> 0:3:18,47
is just idle entertainment tabloid-style provocation

103
0:3:18,47 --> 0:3:21,31
which is fundamentally illegal

104
0:3:21,31 --> 0:3:22,64
But as I always say

105
0:3:22,64 --> 0:3:23,98
know the law and abide by it

106
0:3:23,98 --> 0:3:24,84
don’t break the law

107
0:3:24,84 --> 0:3:25,98
promote the law

108
0:3:25,98 --> 0:3:27,86
don’t go out of your way to provoke

109
0:3:27,86 --> 0:3:31,15
don’t trample on the red lines of society

110
0:3:31,15 --> 0:3:33,7
We all know about this Weibo platform

111
0:3:33,7 --> 0:3:35,13
To be honest, it harbors a lot of filth and corruption.

112
0:3:35,13 --> 0:3:38,5
Often, they do things that are highly unpopular.

113
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:40,42
Then, they incite cyber-bullying,

114
0:3:40,42 --> 0:3:43,5
thinking no one will hold them accountable.

115
0:3:43,5 --> 0:3:43,97
They insult others,

116
0:3:43,97 --> 0:3:46,9
and no one will pursue their responsibility,

117
0:3:46,9 --> 0:3:47,85
or the legal consequences that follow.

118
0:3:47,85 --> 0:3:52,22
Society really needs a few people who are willing to stand up and fight for what's right.

119
0:3:52,22 --> 0:3:53,4
That's how it is.

120
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:54,14
If you're going to stand up for what's right,

121
0:3:54,14 --> 0:3:55,26
Well, of course, speaking of that

122
0:3:55,26 --> 0:3:56,1
We still stand by our statement

123
0:3:56,1 --> 0:3:58,33
It's about having professionals handle professional matters

124
0:3:58,33 --> 0:4:1,81
No matter what, as an ordinary person

125
0:4:3,1 --> 0:4:5,8
You can't possibly have the expertise of law enforcement

126
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:9,6
We're talking about lawyers here

127
0:4:9,6 --> 0:4:10,84
And various defense attorneys

128
0:4:10,84 --> 0:4:12,24
Their professional skills

129
0:4:12,24 --> 0:4:14,23
You definitely lack the professional experience

130
0:4:14,23 --> 0:4:16,27
And the scope of knowledge

131
0:4:16,27 --> 0:4:17,59
When it comes to the finer details

132
0:4:17,59 --> 0:4:19,23
the professionals definitely have the upper hand

133
0:4:19,23 --> 0:4:21,83
so I suggest that when you encounter such situations

134
0:4:21,83 --> 0:4:23,38
either you let it go

135
0:4:23,38 --> 0:4:25,2
but if you can't swallow your pride

136
0:4:25,2 --> 0:4:26,46
you should consult a lawyer

137
0:4:26,46 --> 0:4:28,3
it's all about letting the experts handle their area of expertise

138
0:4:28,3 --> 0:4:30,48
you can't just walk into a hospital

139
0:4:30,48 --> 0:4:31,82
and expect them to give you a few computers

140
0:4:31,82 --> 0:4:34,48
and then use Baidu Deep SG1 to figure out how to treat the illness

141
0:4:34,48 --> 0:4:35,7
Then you went for the tests.

142
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:36,86
You can't just leave it at that, right?

143
0:4:36,86 --> 0:4:38,68
Are you saying you went to the hospital to find a lawyer?

144
0:4:38,68 --> 0:4:39,94
Didn't you say you were seeing a doctor?

145
0:4:39,94 --> 0:4:40,26
Isn't that right?

146
0:4:40,26 --> 0:4:42,25
That's why it's important to have professionals handle professional matters.

147
0:4:42,25 --> 0:4:44,29
The second thing is this...

148
0:4:44,29 --> 0:4:45,87
Ever since Brother Rong got his car...

149
0:4:45,87 --> 0:4:47,17
It's been one trouble after another.

150
0:4:47,17 --> 0:4:50,249
I was thinking about...

151
0:4:50,249 --> 0:4:53,69
I plan to buy a car before May 30th next year.

152
0:4:53,69 --> 0:4:54,229
I'll only keep it for a year.

153
0:4:54,229 --> 0:4:58,619
But I'm worried it might be too rushed at the last minute.

154
0:4:58,619 --> 0:5:0,659
If I push it to the limit,

155
0:5:0,659 --> 0:5:1,619
and buy the car next May,

156
0:5:1,619 --> 0:5:2,419
what if it's too late?

157
0:5:2,419 --> 0:5:3,99
The quota will expire.

158
0:5:3,99 --> 0:5:6,45
So, I finally decided,

159
0:5:6,45 --> 0:5:7,41
maybe I'll buy it during the Spring Festival.

160
0:5:7,41 --> 0:5:9,79
In the end, I bought a motorcycle a couple of days ago.

161
0:5:9,79 --> 0:5:11,23
I thought buying a motorcycle would be smooth

162
0:5:11,23 --> 0:5:13,7
so I ended up getting a car instead

163
0:5:13,7 --> 0:5:15,33
I bought a Geely Panda Knight

164
0:5:15,33 --> 0:5:18,74
and it was on the Guazi Used Cars platform

165
0:5:18,74 --> 0:5:20,14
which you can buy from directly on their website

166
0:5:20,14 --> 0:5:21,74
I originally planned to check out the Zhuanzhuan platform

167
0:5:21,74 --> 0:5:24,46
but there were fewer listings for the same model on Zhuanzhuan

168
0:5:24,46 --> 0:5:26,32
and the quality wasn't great either

169
0:5:26,32 --> 0:5:28,64
the whole process on Guazi was pretty enjoyable

170
0:5:28,64 --> 0:5:29,64
they didn't pay me for this endorsement

171
0:5:29,64 --> 0:5:32,36
But the entire process, with each person responsible for their part, is

172
0:5:32,36 --> 0:5:33,2
pretty quick.

173
0:5:33,2 --> 0:5:36,67
They handed over the car yesterday.

174
0:5:36,67 --> 0:5:38,87
And I’ll be transferring the ownership next week.

175
0:5:38,87 --> 0:5:41,45
To get the Beijing license plate.

176
0:5:41,45 --> 0:5:42,91
Well, how to put it,

177
0:5:42,91 --> 0:5:45,79
the car seems quite affordable to me.

178
0:5:45,79 --> 0:5:46,84
It’s a great deal.

179
0:5:46,84 --> 0:5:49,26
But parking in Beijing is such a hassle.

180
0:5:49,26 --> 0:5:51,36
I definitely need to get the official plates.

181
0:5:51,36 --> 0:5:53,26
Once the official plates are on

182
0:5:53,26 --> 0:5:56,93
we need to wait another two weeks on our street before

183
0:5:56,93 --> 0:6:0,79
parking near our neighborhood, which is between the second and third ring roads

184
0:6:0,79 --> 0:6:1,69
we still can't enter the neighborhood

185
0:6:1,69 --> 0:6:5,91
the parking queue for the neighborhood extends to 2023

186
0:6:5,91 --> 0:6:7,3
it hasn't reached 2024 yet

187
0:6:7,3 --> 0:6:8,51
I started in 2025

188
0:6:8,51 --> 0:6:11,63
so we need to have an official registration

189
0:6:11,63 --> 0:6:14,83
not the previous owner's out-of-town license plates

190
0:6:14,83 --> 0:6:15,91
but a Beijing license plate

191
0:6:15,91 --> 0:6:18,53
But the official registration can't be a temporary plate.

192
0:6:18,53 --> 0:6:20,21
And then there's my property deed.

193
0:6:20,21 --> 0:6:21,9
What a mess.

194
0:6:21,9 --> 0:6:23,25
Then you need to register with the community committee to park on the street.

195
0:6:23,25 --> 0:6:24,77
And register with the property management to park in the neighborhood.

196
0:6:24,77 --> 0:6:26,1
The neighborhood has a waiting list too.

197
0:6:26,1 --> 0:6:27,1
There's a queue in the neighborhood.

198
0:6:27,1 --> 0:6:28,59
Either the car owner is dead,

199
0:6:29,25 --> 0:6:33,23
or the owner has sold the property.

200
0:6:33,23 --> 0:6:35,35
The new homeowner would have to join the queue again.

201
0:6:35,35 --> 0:6:37,97
Anyway, it's pretty bleak.

202
0:6:37,97 --> 0:6:38,99
It's just the first year of junior high school.

203
0:6:38,99 --> 0:6:39,679
That's how it is.

204
0:6:39,679 --> 0:6:42,199
So parking in old neighborhoods in Beijing is quite difficult.

205
0:6:42,199 --> 0:6:44,439
Many people regret not buying a parking space back then.

206
0:6:44,439 --> 0:6:47,49
But now, if you look at houses outside the Fifth Ring Road,

207
0:6:47,49 --> 0:6:49,71
There are many places where you can park anywhere outside the Fifth Ring Road in Beijing.

208
0:6:49,71 --> 0:6:51,84
I found one in Shunyi recently,

209
0:6:51,84 --> 0:6:53,16
A neighborhood of one of my followers,

210
0:6:53,16 --> 0:6:55,66
So I think having followers is really beneficial.

211
0:6:55,66 --> 0:6:57,2
It was my followers who told me

212
0:6:57,2 --> 0:7:0,239
that their residential area doesn’t check or charge for parking fees

213
0:7:0,239 --> 0:7:1,679
but for the underground garage

214
0:7:1,679 --> 0:7:2,419
you can’t get in

215
0:7:2,419 --> 0:7:3,799
but you can park anywhere on the ground

216
0:7:3,799 --> 0:7:5,759
and indeed, when I went there, you could park anywhere on the ground

217
0:7:5,759 --> 0:7:7,85
so after I got my driver’s license yesterday

218
0:7:7,85 --> 0:7:8,77
having not touched a car for 5 years

219
0:7:8,77 --> 0:7:11,57
all the driving experience I’ve had is from playing GTA

220
0:7:11,57 --> 0:7:16,16
I then drove straight from the inspection station to that neighborhood

221
0:7:16,16 --> 0:7:19,75
Then next week, I still have to drive another 28 kilometers.

222
0:7:19,75 --> 0:7:22,13
And then go to handle the transfer procedures.

223
0:7:22,13 --> 0:7:23,5
It’s still okay.

224
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:27,1
My Beijing entry permit is still valid for seven days next week.

225
0:7:27,1 --> 0:7:29,74
For those who don’t know what an entry permit is,

226
0:7:29,74 --> 0:7:30,86
It’s when you enter Beijing,

227
0:7:30,86 --> 0:7:31,94
You can apply for it 12 times a year,

228
0:7:31,94 --> 0:7:34,5
Each time for seven days, totaling 96 days a year.

229
0:7:34,5 --> 0:7:37,4
This allows out-of-town plates to be driven in Beijing,

230
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:38,44
But they can’t enter the Second Ring Road.

231
0:7:38,44 --> 0:7:39,4
You can't enter the Second Ring Road.

232
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:40,62
Pretty interesting, huh?

233
0:7:40,62 --> 0:7:42,32
Parking is quite expensive all over Beijing.

234
0:7:42,32 --> 0:7:43,98
Like the parking spot in front of my house,

235
0:7:43,98 --> 0:7:46,37
most of them charge ten yuan per hour.

236
0:7:46,37 --> 0:7:49,25
There are two or three parking lots that charge ten yuan per hour.

237
0:7:49,25 --> 0:7:51,33
There are also cheaper ones at eight yuan per hour.

238
0:7:51,33 --> 0:7:53,77
But if you park for a day, it’s 240 yuan.

239
0:7:53,77 --> 0:7:55,43
Even 196 yuan for a day is pretty steep.

240
0:7:55,43 --> 0:7:58,21
So parking for a day would be enough for a night in a hotel.

241
0:7:58,21 --> 0:7:58,909
Is it?

242
0:7:58,909 --> 0:8:1,409
I originally thought that in our community,

243
0:8:1,409 --> 0:8:2,669
parking on the street was not allowed.

244
0:8:2,669 --> 0:8:4,149
Later, our community informed us,

245
0:8:4,149 --> 0:8:7,58
that residents of our community can park on both sides of Xueyuan South Road and North Road,

246
0:8:7,58 --> 0:8:9,18
starting from the fourth Dao Kou on the left,

247
0:8:9,18 --> 0:8:9,94
to the Normal University on the right,

248
0:8:9,94 --> 0:8:13,64
along this approximately 34-kilometer-long road,

249
0:8:13,64 --> 0:8:15,28
parking is permitted on both sides.

250
0:8:15,28 --> 0:8:16,42
That would be much more convenient.

251
0:8:16,42 --> 0:8:18,92
I can wait until others leave for work during the day

252
0:8:18,92 --> 0:8:20,4
then I quietly stop

253
0:8:20,4 --> 0:8:22,97
but it's just that I have to walk a bit further from home

254
0:8:22,97 --> 0:8:25,81
not as convenient as parking right outside my door

255
0:8:25,81 --> 0:8:27,57
but parking at the doorstep can be quite troublesome too

256
0:8:27,57 --> 0:8:28,49
it gets really packed

257
0:8:28,49 --> 0:8:31,71
especially in the morning when everyone is leaving or coming in

258
0:8:31,71 --> 0:8:34,91
with just one entrance and exit, reversing is often necessary

259
0:8:34,91 --> 0:8:36,41
and bumping into each other can be quite a hassle

260
0:8:36,41 --> 0:8:39,27
that's why I bought this Panda Knight with a 210km range

261
0:8:39,27 --> 0:8:40,49
But it has fast charging.

262
0:8:40,49 --> 0:8:42,53
And parking is incredibly convenient.

263
0:8:42,53 --> 0:8:44,53
It's more than enough for one person.

264
0:8:44,53 --> 0:8:48,57
So, this is Cyborg Grandpa's car buying experience.

265
0:8:48,57 --> 0:8:50,25
The parking experience can be quite complicated.

266
0:8:50,25 --> 0:8:54,99
But I got this car for 33,600 yuan.

267
0:8:54,99 --> 0:8:55,539
This is how it works in Beijing.

268
0:8:55,539 --> 0:8:57,579
There are discounts for buying new cars in Beijing.

269
0:8:57,579 --> 0:8:59,39
Old cars can also be traded in for value.

270
0:8:59,39 --> 0:9:2,45
That means, with the national subsidy and the trade-in value of the old car,

271
0:9:2,45 --> 0:9:3,81
I have over 30,000 yuan.

272
0:9:3,81 --> 0:9:5,53
For example, I might buy another car next year.

273
0:9:5,53 --> 0:9:7,9
Like a BYD model.

274
0:9:7,9 --> 0:9:8,37
Or a Tesla model.

275
0:9:8,37 --> 0:9:10,51
The 30,000 yuan will be refunded to me.

276
0:9:10,51 --> 0:9:12,33
That is, I traded in my old car.

277
0:9:12,33 --> 0:9:13,41
And with the national subsidy,

278
0:9:13,41 --> 0:9:14,17
it’s roughly 30,000 yuan.

279
0:9:14,17 --> 0:9:15,45
It’s like I didn’t spend a penny,

280
0:9:15,45 --> 0:9:17,5
to buy this car.

281
0:9:18,6 --> 0:9:20,24
Then the aunt compensated me with 10,000 yuan.

282
0:9:20,24 --> 0:9:21,54
I used the 10,000 yuan to buy a motorcycle.

283
0:9:21,54 --> 0:9:22,89
So it was like the aunt bought it for me.

284
0:9:22,89 --> 0:9:25,15
Then, this bike cost 30,000 yuan in total.

285
0:9:25,15 --> 0:9:26,25
When I buy a new car,

286
0:9:26,25 --> 0:9:27,41
I can get the 30,000 yuan back.

287
0:9:27,41 --> 0:9:29,79
So essentially, I got two vehicles for free.

288
0:9:29,79 --> 0:9:30,61
Pretty good.

289
0:9:30,61 --> 0:9:32,13
Saving money to the max.

290
0:9:32,13 --> 0:9:34,73
Lastly, I want to mention something that concerns everyone.

291
0:9:34,73 --> 0:9:37,35
So everyone knows about my course, right?

292
0:9:37,35 --> 0:9:39,51
Yeah, I'm still working hard on it, even with all the other stuff going on.

293
0:9:39,51 --> 0:9:42,14
I promise I will definitely finish updating it this month.

294
0:9:42,14 --> 0:9:48,44
Well, I have the right to sell courses on this platform.

295
0:9:48,44 --> 0:9:50,9
Many of my followers,

296
0:9:50,9 --> 0:9:53,93
for example, are chess masters or Pilates instructors,

297
0:9:53,93 --> 0:9:56,62
or coaches for math competitions,

298
0:9:56,62 --> 0:9:58,18
or art teachers,

299
0:9:58,18 --> 0:9:58,82
or music instructors,

300
0:9:58,82 --> 0:9:59,5
or fine arts educators.

301
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:1,98
all sorts of talented people

302
0:10:1,98 --> 0:10:3,2
if you want to collaborate with me

303
0:10:3,2 --> 0:10:6,2
like posting your courses on my channel

304
0:10:6,2 --> 0:10:7,34
we can actually work together

305
0:10:7,34 --> 0:10:9,42
when it comes to the courses I post

306
0:10:9,42 --> 0:10:11,62
I have a company contract with Bilibili

307
0:10:11,62 --> 0:10:12,24
speaking of which

308
0:10:12,24 --> 0:10:14,46
it’s actually a collaboration with the company

309
0:10:14,46 --> 0:10:17,42
it’s not like I, Rong Zhen, am the one giving all the lectures

310
0:10:17,42 --> 0:10:19,28
for example, if you have a great course

311
0:10:19,28 --> 0:10:20,66
I think people will like it

312
0:10:20,66 --> 0:10:21,58
People will be willing to pay for it

313
0:10:21,58 --> 0:10:23,4
Then you teach me

314
0:10:23,4 --> 0:10:26,66
Basically, you need to record something over 30 minutes long

315
0:10:26,66 --> 0:10:28,12
And it should be at level five or above

316
0:10:28,12 --> 0:10:31,52
Ideally, I think it’s best to record between ten to twenty episodes

317
0:10:31,52 --> 0:10:33,3
The total length should be a few hours

318
0:10:33,3 --> 0:10:34,66
Four to six hours would be ideal

319
0:10:34,66 --> 0:10:36,34
If you have something in this area

320
0:10:36,34 --> 0:10:37,26
Find someone to help you record

321
0:10:37,26 --> 0:10:38,4
Or you can take a selfie

322
0:10:38,4 --> 0:10:39,14
Record yourself

323
0:10:39,14 --> 0:10:40,2
After you're done recording

324
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:41,59
You can start with one episode

325
0:10:41,59 --> 0:10:44,5
Then find a way to contact me

326
0:10:44,5 --> 0:10:44,77
Send it to me first

327
0:10:44,77 --> 0:10:45,53
Let me take a look

328
0:10:45,53 --> 0:10:46,84
Then I'll give you some guidance

329
0:10:46,84 --> 0:10:49,8
Our course revenue is split fifty-fifty

330
0:10:49,8 --> 0:10:51,82
You can, for example, use this tool

331
0:10:51,82 --> 0:10:53,14
For instance, if you do a great job

332
0:10:53,14 --> 0:10:54,9
course by course

333
0:10:54,9 --> 0:10:58,41
you can typically earn a few thousand dollars without any issue

334
0:10:58,41 --> 0:11:0,82
so the income from this is quite substantial

335
0:11:0,82 --> 0:11:2,6
on top of your regular activities

336
0:11:2,6 --> 0:11:3,18
for example, if you are a college student now

337
0:11:3,18 --> 0:11:5,2
you have just finished your postgraduate entrance exam

338
0:11:5,2 --> 0:11:6,16
you got accepted into a postgraduate program

339
0:11:6,16 --> 0:11:7,4
but you are interested in political science for the postgraduate entrance exam

340
0:11:7,4 --> 0:11:8,0
or the English for the postgraduate entrance exam

341
0:11:8,0 --> 0:11:9,56
I have a lot of insights when it comes to preparing for the postgraduate math exam.

342
0:11:9,56 --> 0:11:11,48
Or are you currently taking the French exam?

343
0:11:11,48 --> 0:11:12,93
You're taking the TCF French exam.

344
0:11:12,93 --> 0:11:14,69
You have insights in this area.

345
0:11:14,69 --> 0:11:16,89
We can summarize and turn it into a video course.

346
0:11:16,89 --> 0:11:17,98
Then collaborate with me.

347
0:11:17,98 --> 0:11:18,62
Work together with me.

348
0:11:18,62 --> 0:11:19,18
We'll release it.

349
0:11:19,18 --> 0:11:21,48
And we split all the costs down the middle.

350
0:11:21,48 --> 0:11:24,6
That's my actual income after all is said and done.

351
0:11:24,6 --> 0:11:26,4
We can each post half of it.

352
0:11:26,4 --> 0:11:27,18
This way is better.

353
0:11:27,18 --> 0:11:30,44
And the course is not primarily for Follower courses.

354
0:11:30,44 --> 0:11:32,4
He uses apartment traffic.

355
0:11:32,4 --> 0:11:35,17
That means people who might not know me at all.

356
0:11:35,17 --> 0:11:37,71
Then they would come across my content through this.

357
0:11:37,71 --> 0:11:39,75
Of course, if you start a new account, it’s different.

358
0:11:39,75 --> 0:11:41,31
It definitely won’t match my large account.

359
0:11:41,31 --> 0:11:43,97
The traffic flows more smoothly with this approach.

360
0:11:43,97 --> 0:11:46,27
Usually, there won’t be any review or blocking issues.

361
0:11:46,27 --> 0:11:48,41
So, if you're looking for me,

362
0:11:48,41 --> 0:11:51,17
working with me is a very suitable way,

363
0:11:51,17 --> 0:11:54,5
so I've brought this lesson to share with everyone.

364
0:11:54,5 --> 0:11:55,44
this is also for you,

365
0:11:55,44 --> 0:11:56,12
how to put it,

366
0:11:56,12 --> 0:11:57,48
to hone personal skills,

367
0:11:57,48 --> 0:11:58,64
to summarize and conclude,

368
0:11:58,64 --> 0:12:2,16
and it's also a good way to earn extra income.

369
0:12:2,16 --> 0:12:5,26
now, online knowledge payment is a trend,

370
0:12:5,26 --> 0:12:6,68
various skills

371
0:12:6,68 --> 0:12:9,1
Actually, everyone is willing to spend money on these things.

372
0:12:9,1 --> 0:12:11,9
As for the pricing,

373
0:12:11,9 --> 0:12:11,93
I'll set it for you.

374
0:12:11,93 --> 0:12:13,29
And when it comes to specifics,

375
0:12:13,29 --> 0:12:15,13
I hope you can contact me via WeChat at that time.

376
0:12:15,13 --> 0:12:17,37
You can add it to my signature.

377
0:12:17,37 --> 0:12:17,57
I

378
0:12:17,57 --> 0:12:18,879
can also say,

379
0:12:18,879 --> 0:12:20,559
feel free to leave a message for me,

380
0:12:20,559 --> 0:12:22,499
or send a message to my group admins.

381
0:12:22,499 --> 0:12:23,479
Don't @ me

382
0:12:23,479 --> 0:12:24,459
Tag the group admin

383
0:12:24,459 --> 0:12:26,22
if they're willing to work with me

384
0:12:26,22 --> 0:12:27,22
after watching this episode

385
0:12:27,22 --> 0:12:28,42
everyone is welcome to collaborate with me

386
0:12:28,42 --> 0:12:30,67
these are the three major events in my recent life

387
0:12:30,67 --> 0:12:32,31
I originally planned to stretch it into three episodes

388
0:12:32,31 --> 0:12:33,91
but then I thought it would be better to save everyone's time

389
0:12:33,91 --> 0:12:35,65
so here it is, all in one episode

390
0:12:35,65 --> 0:12:37,28
wish everyone a pleasant weekend
