1
0:0:0,1 --> 0:0:1,76
He puts on the VR gear.

2
0:0:1,76 --> 0:0:4,77
Instantly, he's sucked into a dark and eerie virtual world.

3
0:0:4,77 --> 0:0:6,31
Fog surrounds him.

4
0:0:6,31 --> 0:0:8,55
Dry branches creak in the wind.

5
0:0:8,55 --> 0:0:10,37
There's an inexplicable sense of creepiness.

6
0:0:10,37 --> 0:0:12,73
Here, he meets him.

7
0:0:12,73 --> 0:0:15,23
They decide to team up and find a way out.

8
0:0:15,23 --> 0:0:16,81
As they delve deeper into the game,

9
0:0:16,81 --> 0:0:18,61
They noticed something was off.

10
0:0:18,61 --> 0:0:21,52
Many players were trapped inside, unable to leave.

11
0:0:24,36 --> 0:0:27,48
They realized there was a conspiracy behind it, orchestrated by the game company.

12
0:0:27,48 --> 0:0:31,4
The company was using this virtual world to harvest invaluable organs.

13
0:0:31,4 --> 0:0:32,739
During their adventure,

14
0:0:32,739 --> 0:0:34,299
dangers kept emerging one after another.

15
0:0:34,299 --> 0:0:37,539
They encountered skeletal hands that suddenly burst out of the ground.

16
0:0:37,539 --> 0:0:39,87
They also came across ghosts that could teleport.

17
0:0:39,87 --> 0:0:41,49
Every close call

18
0:0:41,49 --> 0:0:43,85
only strengthens their bond

19
0:0:43,85 --> 0:0:45,87
Love thrives in the midst of terror

20
0:0:45,87 --> 0:0:47,1
growing stronger

21
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:48,72
They explore every corner

22
0:0:48,72 --> 0:0:50,67
searching for clues to escape

23
0:0:50,67 --> 0:0:52,51
In an abandoned castle

24
0:0:52,51 --> 0:0:54,25
they discover a document

25
0:0:54,25 --> 0:0:57,35
It meticulously documents the game company's plot and the departure.

26
0:0:57,35 --> 0:0:58,57
The game is great.

27
0:0:58,57 --> 0:1:1,69
But it requires sacrificing one person to request the escape program.

28
0:1:1,69 --> 0:1:3,19
The two fell silent.

29
0:1:3,19 --> 0:1:5,31
Neither was willing to face the grim reality of a human death.

30
0:1:5,5 --> 0:1:9,8
In the end, he took advantage of the other’s distraction to go.

31
0:1:9,8 --> 0:1:11,5
A glow enveloped him.

32
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:13,34
He called out anxiously.

33
0:1:13,9 --> 0:1:15,98
Quickly return to reality

34
0:1:15,98 --> 0:1:17,2
A good life

35
0:1:17,2 --> 0:1:20,54
It’s impossible for him to smile

36
0:1:20,54 --> 0:1:23,66
He was pushed out of the virtual world by a powerful force

37
0:1:25,65 --> 0:1:27,94
He looked around the empty room

38
0:1:27,94 --> 0:1:29,8
Tears streamed down his face

39
0:1:29,8 --> 0:1:32,63
Recalling every moment in the virtual world

40
0:1:32,655 --> 0:1:36,5
Those were his most precious yet painful memories

41
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:39,75
And she was forever trapped in that terrifying virtual world

42
0:1:39,77 --> 0:1:41,19
Since then

43
0:1:41,19 --> 0:1:44,6
He has been living well in the real world with his hobbies
