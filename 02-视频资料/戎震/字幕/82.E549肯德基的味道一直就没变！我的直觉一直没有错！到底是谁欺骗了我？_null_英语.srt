0:0:0,24 --> 0:0:1,24
Hi everyone

2
0:0:1,24 --> 0:0:5,52
It's 2:10 AM, just ten minutes before 2:22

3
0:0:5,52 --> 0:0:8,2
This is episode 549 or 557 of the mattress series

4
0:0:8,2 --> 0:0:9,4
I don't really care

5
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:9,58
No worries

6
0:0:9,58 --> 0:0:14,32
The topic for this episode is that you should always trust your gut

7
0:0:14,32 --> 0:0:17,7
You might be right all along

8
0:0:17,7 --> 0:0:20,15
I spent a week in Shandong

9
0:0:20,15 --> 0:0:22,55
I barely make any videos.

10
0:0:22,55 --> 0:0:24,47
Yeah, let's keep it short.

11
0:0:24,47 --> 0:0:28,16
But this week, there have been a lot of topics to talk about.

12
0:0:28,16 --> 0:0:29,6
If you've been following me lately

13
0:0:29,6 --> 0:0:33,58
You'll notice that I've launched a few new series in my Power-Up videos.

14
0:0:33,58 --> 0:0:37,54
I'm not sure which series will really capture everyone's interest,

15
0:0:37,54 --> 0:0:39,59
so I've started a few new ones to see what sticks.

16
0:0:39,59 --> 0:0:41,37
I'll check how the revenue is doing,

17
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:43,31
Now, let's talk about the free videos.

18
0:0:43,31 --> 0:0:45,7
I've already outlined the main ideas.

19
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:45,75
Well, how to put it

20
0:0:45,75 --> 0:0:47,74
Uh, the title for the third episode

21
0:0:47,74 --> 0:0:49,56
As you all know, I usually write the titles

22
0:0:49,56 --> 0:0:50,5
But not the scripts

23
0:0:50,5 --> 0:0:53,78
But the titles for these three episodes are all incredibly explosive

24
0:0:53,78 --> 0:0:55,2
Each one more explosive than the last

25
0:0:55,2 --> 0:0:57,53
This is also my reflection on many things I've read.

26
0:0:57,53 --> 0:1:0,41
So, everyone has been checking out my recent updates.

27
0:1:0,41 --> 0:1:1,77
Well, how to say it

28
0:1:1,77 --> 0:1:2,71
Let's get started.

29
0:1:2,71 --> 0:1:4,43
There will be a lot of exciting content.

30
0:1:4,43 --> 0:1:5,79
Everyone, keep following, please.

31
0:1:5,79 --> 0:1:7,63
This is one of my marketing scripts.

32
0:1:7,63 --> 0:1:10,23
But it really is quite interesting, though.

33
0:1:10,23 --> 0:1:14,67
When I was a kid, my parents worked at this China Bookstore.

34
0:1:14,67 --> 0:1:17,61
There was a KFC near Hepingmen.

35
0:1:17,61 --> 0:1:23,45
Since I had a relatively comfortable family life back then,

36
0:1:23,45 --> 0:1:25,7
I was in first grade at elementary school.

37
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:26,79
It was back in 1990

38
0:1:26,79 --> 0:1:28,31
when I had my first taste of KFC

39
0:1:28,31 --> 0:1:30,47
KFC had a store in Qianmen at that time

40
0:1:30,47 --> 0:1:32,27
and there seemed to be one in Hepingmen as well

41
0:1:32,27 --> 0:1:33,47
I've forgotten the specifics

42
0:1:33,47 --> 0:1:34,96
but it should have been the store in Qianmen

43
0:1:34,96 --> 0:1:37,72
the one where Professor Yuan Tengfei once worked

44
0:1:37,72 --> 0:1:41,96
KFC's fourth store was in Zhongguancun

45
0:1:41,96 --> 0:1:42,84
Zhongguancun back then

46
0:1:42,84 --> 0:1:44,8
Next to the fourth KFC, there was also a bathhouse.

47
0:1:44,8 --> 0:1:46,89
That was the early Zhongguancun.

48
0:1:46,89 --> 0:1:48,27
These things weren't the main focus.

49
0:1:48,27 --> 0:1:50,89
When I was a kid, I thought KFC was incredibly delicious.

50
0:1:50,89 --> 0:1:52,39
Especially tasty.

51
0:1:52,39 --> 0:1:53,879
Once I had it, I couldn't get enough.

52
0:1:53,879 --> 0:1:54,679
I always wanted to go back.

53
0:1:54,679 --> 0:1:57,93
The second time I ate KFC after growing up,

54
0:1:57,93 --> 0:1:58,83
it was still a craze.

55
0:1:58,83 --> 0:2:0,3
Thursday can be pretty wild too.

56
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:2,75
While I did feel great eating the original recipe chicken,

57
0:2:2,75 --> 0:2:6,25
it just doesn’t taste as good as it did when I was a kid.

58
0:2:6,25 --> 0:2:9,73
I once thought it was just me,

59
0:2:9,73 --> 0:2:12,329
that my taste had changed,

60
0:2:12,329 --> 0:2:16,49
that I had gradually gotten used to KFC.

61
0:2:16,49 --> 0:2:20,19
So the things that tasted good when I was young don’t anymore.

62
0:2:20,19 --> 0:2:22,35
It wasn’t until many years later,

63
0:2:22,35 --> 0:2:25,43
but even now it’s been over a decade.

64
0:2:25,43 --> 0:2:28,52
I had KFC in Toronto

65
0:2:28,52 --> 0:2:32,3
and it completely changed my perception at that time

66
0:2:32,3 --> 0:2:34,36
First, let me tell you what happened

67
0:2:34,36 --> 0:2:35,68
When I was a kid, eating KFC

68
0:2:35,68 --> 0:2:37,1
I really loved the mini burgers

69
0:2:37,1 --> 0:2:37,64
mashed potatoes

70
0:2:37,64 --> 0:2:38,56
and salads

71
0:2:38,56 --> 0:2:40,9
of course, with one or two pieces of Original Recipe chicken

72
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:41,44
the Original Recipe chicken

73
0:2:41,44 --> 0:2:44,13
I feel that the chicken broth is particularly rich.

74
0:2:44,13 --> 0:2:46,87
I really enjoy the skin of KFC's Original Recipe Chicken.

75
0:2:46,87 --> 0:2:47,95
It's all about this.

76
0:2:47,95 --> 0:2:49,65
Of course, talking about now,

77
0:2:49,65 --> 0:2:52,6
After so many years of changes,

78
0:2:52,6 --> 0:2:54,88
I've grown from a six-year-old kid into a 41-year-old,

79
0:2:54,88 --> 0:2:57,18
a middle-aged person,

80
0:2:57,18 --> 0:2:58,57
like Old Deng,

81
0:2:58,57 --> 0:2:59,93
35 years have passed.

82
0:2:59,93 --> 0:3:0,97
So much has changed.

83
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:2,65
It’s been 35 years since World War II ended.

84
0:3:2,65 --> 0:3:3,97
We can have a few more rounds now.

85
0:3:3,97 --> 0:3:5,25
Right?

86
0:3:5,61 --> 0:3:7,17
During these 35 years,

87
0:3:7,17 --> 0:3:10,59
the suppliers of KFC’s ingredients,

88
0:3:10,59 --> 0:3:13,73
as well as their production processes, have undergone some changes.

89
0:3:13,73 --> 0:3:17,23
They have made more adaptations to the Chinese market.

90
0:3:17,23 --> 0:3:20,6
Back in 2011,

91
0:3:20,6 --> 0:3:23,2
After graduating from France, I went on to study in Canada.

92
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:24,76
When I was studying in Canada,

93
0:3:24,76 --> 0:3:26,93
I stayed in Vancouver on the west coast.

94
0:3:26,93 --> 0:3:29,59
Vancouver is a very developed city.

95
0:3:29,59 --> 0:3:31,5
Speaking of Vancouver,

96
0:3:31,5 --> 0:3:33,329
it's quite polarized.

97
0:3:33,329 --> 0:3:35,729
There are a lot of people working in the service industry at the bottom,

98
0:3:35,729 --> 0:3:37,409
and there are many wealthy individuals at the top.

99
0:3:37,409 --> 0:3:38,829
The middle class is relatively small.

100
0:3:38,829 --> 0:3:41,469
So the culture of KFC isn't as developed.

101
0:3:41,469 --> 0:3:44,389
After all, KFC is still more of a middle-class brand.

102
0:3:44,389 --> 0:3:48,34
And it leans more towards being a working-class food.

103
0:3:48,34 --> 0:3:50,67
As we all know, many African Americans enjoy eating chicken.

104
0:3:50,67 --> 0:3:53,35
So in the West Coast KFCs, for instance,

105
0:3:53,35 --> 0:3:55,37
their market share is much lower than McDonald's.

106
0:3:55,37 --> 0:3:57,25
And as everyone knows, in foreign countries,

107
0:3:57,25 --> 0:3:58,89
the Golden Arches have a significant presence,

108
0:3:58,89 --> 0:4:0,93
far greater than KFC's.

109
0:4:0,93 --> 0:4:1,85
And to talk about it,

110
0:4:1,85 --> 0:4:3,97
we're talking about the situation in Canada here,

111
0:4:3,97 --> 0:4:6,23
Canada has the most Tim Hortons, right?

112
0:4:6,23 --> 0:4:7,67
Tim Hortons,

113
0:4:7,67 --> 0:4:9,15
and in the United States,

114
0:4:9,15 --> 0:4:11,43
the U.S. has a lot of them,

115
0:4:11,43 --> 0:4:14,78
what's it called again,

116
0:4:14,78 --> 0:4:16,38
Wendy's,

117
0:4:16,38 --> 0:4:17,26
Taco Bell

118
0:4:17,26 --> 0:4:18,279
What else?

119
0:4:18,279 --> 0:4:19,719
You know, what’s it called again?

120
0:4:19,719 --> 0:4:21,299
Anyway, I’m not really familiar with it.

121
0:4:21,299 --> 0:4:23,399
It’s just those common types you often see in GTA.

122
0:4:23,399 --> 0:4:26,14
American cuisine is quite diverse, you know.

123
0:4:26,14 --> 0:4:28,47
And there are more tacos, of course.

124
0:4:28,47 --> 0:4:30,3
Speaking of KFC,

125
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:33,43
Apart from its well-known locations,

126
0:4:33,43 --> 0:4:36,3
there’s the original store in Kentucky.

127
0:4:36,3 --> 0:4:37,9
I haven't been there either.

128
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:41,22
But there are many other fried chicken places

129
0:4:41,22 --> 0:4:43,45
that are already better than KFC.

130
0:4:43,45 --> 0:4:46,21
After I graduated from university,

131
0:4:46,21 --> 0:4:47,89
I first attended a performing arts school,

132
0:4:47,89 --> 0:4:49,73
and then went to Kwantlen Polytechnic University.

133
0:4:49,73 --> 0:4:53,289
After graduation, I was a regular international student in Canada,

134
0:4:53,289 --> 0:4:53,809
Here’s how it works,

135
0:4:53,809 --> 0:4:55,149
you get a three-year work permit.

136
0:4:55,149 --> 0:4:55,809
A three-year work permit

137
0:4:55,809 --> 0:4:57,809
If you work hard, you can become a PR

138
0:4:57,809 --> 0:5:0,0
You know, get that so-called maple leaf card or green card

139
0:5:0,0 --> 0:5:1,32
Back then, for me

140
0:5:1,32 --> 0:5:2,22
As a humanities student

141
0:5:2,22 --> 0:5:3,56
As an arts student

142
0:5:3,56 --> 0:5:4,66
We're not joking here

143
0:5:4,66 --> 0:5:7,18
The ghostwriting business was thriving

144
0:5:7,18 --> 0:5:10,64
But this kind of underground business can't help you immigrate

145
0:5:10,64 --> 0:5:12,24
After all, it's not something that can offer job positions

146
0:5:12,24 --> 0:5:13,72
or generate tax revenue, you see

147
0:5:13,72 --> 0:5:14,64
it's completely tax-free

148
0:5:14,64 --> 0:5:15,5
that's how it is

149
0:5:15,5 --> 0:5:18,2
so back then, it was just a business

150
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:21,76
I decided to check out the opportunities

151
0:5:21,76 --> 0:5:26,15
to see if there's any new kind of relationship forming on the East Coast

152
0:5:26,15 --> 0:5:27,23
to put it that way

153
0:5:27,23 --> 0:5:28,91
but once you switch to a work visa

154
0:5:28,91 --> 0:5:30,23
you can't change to a student visa anymore

155
0:5:30,23 --> 0:5:32,19
so back then when I went there

156
0:5:32,19 --> 0:5:33,7
I went to the East Coast just for fun

157
0:5:33,7 --> 0:5:35,34
but in the end

158
0:5:35,34 --> 0:5:38,24
I stayed in Toronto for about a month

159
0:5:38,24 --> 0:5:40,56
and didn't go to Montreal

160
0:5:40,56 --> 0:5:41,82
or Quebec and such

161
0:5:41,82 --> 0:5:44,2
or Ottawa and Halifax to take a trip around

162
0:5:44,2 --> 0:5:45,34
and later I left directly from Toronto

163
0:5:45,34 --> 0:5:46,86
I flew 14 hours to return home.

164
0:5:46,86 --> 0:5:49,179
Because my grandfather was critically ill at that time.

165
0:5:49,179 --> 0:5:51,99
But that wasn't the important part.

166
0:5:51,99 --> 0:5:52,979
What was important was that I was in Toronto.

167
0:5:52,979 --> 0:5:54,94
Back then, I rented a place.

168
0:5:54,94 --> 0:5:56,3
It was near UT,

169
0:5:56,3 --> 0:5:59,8
right across from the University of Toronto's campus.

170
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:2,99
Across from the campus is a small area,

171
0:6:2,99 --> 0:6:4,39
a really interesting Korean town.

172
0:6:4,39 --> 0:6:7,219
This is a mixed neighborhood with a lot of Black residents.

173
0:6:7,219 --> 0:6:8,179
There are also many Koreans.

174
0:6:8,179 --> 0:6:9,41
And there are a lot of Black people as well.

175
0:6:9,41 --> 0:6:10,799
There are plenty of Korean restaurants.

176
0:6:10,799 --> 0:6:12,839
And haircuts are mostly handled by Black people.

177
0:6:12,839 --> 0:6:14,639
The rooms are incredibly small.

178
0:6:14,639 --> 0:6:17,299
This really left me with a poor impression of Toronto.

179
0:6:17,299 --> 0:6:21,37
Because, to be honest, Vancouver is a bit like Xiamen.

180
0:6:21,37 --> 0:6:23,11
But Toronto is very much like New York.

181
0:6:23,11 --> 0:6:26,19
Toronto has that New York vibe.

182
0:6:26,19 --> 0:6:28,81
The crowdedness is somewhat reminiscent of Hong Kong.

183
0:6:28,81 --> 0:6:30,65
As everyone knows, I dislike Hong Kong.

184
0:6:30,65 --> 0:6:31,71
But I like Xiamen.

185
0:6:31,71 --> 0:6:33,32
Many people might be aware of that.

186
0:6:33,32 --> 0:6:34,12
I also like Shenzhen.

187
0:6:34,12 --> 0:6:34,6
And I like Guangzhou.

188
0:6:34,6 --> 0:6:36,2
But I don't like Hong Kong

189
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:38,39
However, I think the people in Hong Kong are still great.

190
0:6:38,39 --> 0:6:40,3
Because the Hong Kong people I've interacted with

191
0:6:40,3 --> 0:6:43,189
regardless of their inclinations

192
0:6:43,189 --> 0:6:45,129
have all been very nice to me

193
0:6:45,129 --> 0:6:46,669
have all been very kind to me

194
0:6:46,669 --> 0:6:50,4
But my main reason for disliking Hong Kong is the housing issue.

195
0:6:50,4 --> 0:6:50,96
hotels are too expensive

196
0:6:50,96 --> 0:6:52,1
the cost of living is too high

197
0:6:52,1 --> 0:6:53,48
the living spaces are too cramped

198
0:6:53,48 --> 0:6:55,32
it's not that Hong Kong people lack earning power

199
0:6:55,32 --> 0:6:56,38
That's not right.

200
0:6:56,38 --> 0:7:0,23
And at that time, I was in Wenzhou.

201
0:7:0,23 --> 0:7:3,1
The best friend in Toronto is also from Hong Kong.

202
0:7:3,1 --> 0:7:5,2
When I was in Vancouver, I was also in Vancouver.

203
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:6,92
That guy is a bit of a fraud.

204
0:7:6,92 --> 0:7:8,2
Let's not go into specifics.

205
0:7:8,2 --> 0:7:9,5
We won't mention TOBY.

206
0:7:9,5 --> 0:7:11,42
And the friend in Toronto.

207
0:7:11,42 --> 0:7:13,14
The Hong Kong friend.

208
0:7:13,14 --> 0:7:15,6
He's particularly hardworking and resilient.

209
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:15,86
He works.

210
0:7:15,86 --> 0:7:16,98
He takes on multiple jobs.

211
0:7:16,98 --> 0:7:19,1
And his foresight is quite different.

212
0:7:19,1 --> 0:7:20,54
His views on the continent,

213
0:7:20,54 --> 0:7:21,82
the development of Hong Kong, and so on,

214
0:7:21,82 --> 0:7:25,35
align with the mainstream values in the mainland.

215
0:7:25,35 --> 0:7:26,53
That's a friend of mine.

216
0:7:26,53 --> 0:7:29,42
He became my roommate in that place.

217
0:7:29,42 --> 0:7:30,56
Let me talk about my roommate.

218
0:7:30,56 --> 0:7:33,84
To put it simply, I'm just chatting casually now.

219
0:7:33,84 --> 0:7:36,2
There are people living on the first and third floors.

220
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:38,26
My roommate and I live on the second floor with a few Black girls.

221
0:7:38,26 --> 0:7:40,8
And there are those with brown skin.

222
0:7:40,8 --> 0:7:41,99
The Korean couple lives on the first floor.

223
0:7:41,99 --> 0:7:44,31
The elderly Korean couple really likes me.

224
0:7:44,31 --> 0:7:45,6
They have a preference for Asians.

225
0:7:45,6 --> 0:7:47,4
I find those Black girls particularly annoying.

226
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:48,14
Because they don't pay rent on time

227
0:7:48,14 --> 0:7:49,4
It's all good, party on

228
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:50,24
It's all good

229
0:7:50,24 --> 0:7:50,84
That's it

230
0:7:50,84 --> 0:7:52,86
So we tend to be more rule-abiding

231
0:7:52,86 --> 0:7:54,7
But back then

232
0:7:54,7 --> 0:7:56,389
How should I put it

233
0:7:56,389 --> 0:7:59,189
I invested in things I shouldn't have during that period

234
0:7:59,189 --> 0:8:0,809
And then the economic crisis hit

235
0:8:0,809 --> 0:8:2,59
I had to be particularly frugal when it came to meals.

236
0:8:2,59 --> 0:8:4,3
So back then, I had to be frugal with my meals.

237
0:8:4,3 --> 0:8:5,67
You couldn't go out for Chinese food every day.

238
0:8:5,67 --> 0:8:7,79
When I was in Wen Hua, I mostly ate Chinese food.

239
0:8:7,79 --> 0:8:9,11
Over there, you know,

240
0:8:9,11 --> 0:8:10,19
I wasn't used to eating Korean food either.

241
0:8:10,19 --> 0:8:10,59
You know?

242
0:8:10,59 --> 0:8:12,97
Because Korean BBQ and other Korean dishes,

243
0:8:12,97 --> 0:8:16,0
like bibimbap, were of course still okay.

244
0:8:16,0 --> 0:8:16,94
But let me tell you

245
0:8:16,94 --> 0:8:19,34
it feels like when you go out, you run into Koreans

246
0:8:19,34 --> 0:8:20,64
and Japanese people are quite friendly

247
0:8:20,64 --> 0:8:22,3
Koreans and Japanese tend to be quite friendly towards you

248
0:8:22,3 --> 0:8:23,539
because we're all Asians

249
0:8:23,539 --> 0:8:25,179
since we're all Asians

250
0:8:25,179 --> 0:8:27,319
we can communicate in English as well

251
0:8:27,319 --> 0:8:29,2
so it feels much better

252
0:8:29,2 --> 0:8:30,18
and to that point

253
0:8:30,18 --> 0:8:31,5
He sees the same people

254
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:34,18
The Korean boss sees an Asian person

255
0:8:34,18 --> 0:8:36,58
Seeing a Chinese person makes him more comfortable than seeing a Black person

256
0:8:36,58 --> 0:8:39,68
But Koreans still hang out with Africans and Black people

257
0:8:39,68 --> 0:8:39,96
You know

258
0:8:39,96 --> 0:8:41,64
Because on the West Coast, I hardly ever see

259
0:8:41,64 --> 0:8:45,579
Pure African Americans, you hardly ever see them

260
0:8:45,579 --> 0:8:48,36
Of course, they are different from African Canadians

261
0:8:48,36 --> 0:8:51,56
And Black people are very sparsely distributed in Canada

262
0:8:51,56 --> 0:8:52,68
Because it's cold

263
0:8:52,68 --> 0:8:53,8
Compared to that, the cold in Xihan is less severe

264
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:55,8
Xihan is mainly populated by Indians

265
0:8:55,8 --> 0:8:56,44
It's mostly Indians

266
0:8:56,44 --> 0:8:58,28
Nowadays, there are a lot of Indians everywhere

267
0:8:58,28 --> 0:8:59,3
Anyway, that's not important

268
0:8:59,3 --> 0:9:1,64
But I went to a KFC there

269
0:9:1,64 --> 0:9:3,92
The prices were really cheap

270
0:9:3,92 --> 0:9:5,16
Just a few dollars per item

271
0:9:5,16 --> 0:9:7,46
The kind of original recipe chicken that costs just a couple of bucks.

272
0:9:7,46 --> 0:9:8,6
Later on, I...

273
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:12,9
Back then, I ate KFC for over two weeks straight.

274
0:9:12,9 --> 0:9:13,89
Why was that?

275
0:9:13,89 --> 0:9:15,249
Because, you know, I was broke.

276
0:9:15,249 --> 0:9:17,409
But the main reason wasn't just being broke.

277
0:9:17,409 --> 0:9:19,449
The main reason was that KFC...

278
0:9:19,449 --> 0:9:21,929
It tasted like my childhood.

279
0:9:22,26 --> 0:9:26,2
It was the same flavor I had at the KFC in Qianmen.

280
0:9:26,18 --> 0:9:28,86
KFC has been adapted many times in the domestic market.

281
0:9:28,86 --> 0:9:32,2
So the taste is different from the original one 35 years ago.

282
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:35,29
The KFC of 1990 is no longer the same.

283
0:9:35,77 --> 0:9:37,53
Of course, my memory might be a bit off.

284
0:9:37,53 --> 0:9:39,41
For example, it might have opened in 91 or 89.

285
0:9:39,41 --> 0:9:40,93
Don't worry, don't attack me over this.

286
0:9:40,93 --> 0:9:41,17
It's fine.

287
0:9:41,17 --> 0:9:42,13
I'm not afraid of your attacks.

288
0:9:42,13 --> 0:9:43,21
Just delete it anyway.

289
0:9:43,21 --> 0:9:43,9
You're done.

290
0:9:43,9 --> 0:9:46,86
Back in 1990, when I was in first grade, eating there felt

291
0:9:46,86 --> 0:9:48,22
Totally different.

292
0:9:48,22 --> 0:9:49,5
It feels completely different now.

293
0:9:49,5 --> 0:9:51,9
Back then, KFC and McDonald's used to give out gifts.

294
0:9:51,9 --> 0:9:54,5
It was around third grade when McDonald's started becoming popular.

295
0:9:54,5 --> 0:9:56,1
Before that, we only ate at KFC.

296
0:9:56,1 --> 0:9:57,13
They used to give out gifts too.

297
0:9:57,13 --> 0:9:57,93
All sorts of gifts.

298
0:9:57,93 --> 0:9:58,93
Back then, there wasn’t QiQi

299
0:9:58,93 --> 0:10:1,44
and it had to be the earliest version of Colonel Sanders

300
0:10:1,44 --> 0:10:2,28
all sorts of things

301
0:10:2,28 --> 0:10:3,76
and then there was Baskin-Robbins ice cream

302
0:10:3,76 --> 0:10:5,84
so it was considered a high-end treat back then

303
0:10:5,84 --> 0:10:9,34
to be honest, having a meal at KFC was like dining at the Moscow Restaurant

304
0:10:9,34 --> 0:10:10,24
it felt different

305
0:10:10,24 --> 0:10:11,91
but it was still quite expensive

306
0:10:11,91 --> 0:10:14,77
so people often chose to have their birthday parties at KFC

307
0:10:14,77 --> 0:10:17,81
So the KFC I had in Toronto

308
0:10:18,21 --> 0:10:21,48
was really just the original KFC

309
0:10:21,84 --> 0:10:24,48
and it genuinely made me feel

310
0:10:24,48 --> 0:10:28,3
It really shook my worldview at that moment.

311
0:10:28,3 --> 0:10:31,8
because in my intuition

312
0:10:31,8 --> 0:10:34,6
a lot of things I felt were actually right

313
0:10:34,6 --> 0:10:36,38
they were indeed correct

314
0:10:36,38 --> 0:10:37,56
really strange

315
0:10:37,56 --> 0:10:40,1
I actually visited these two cities in Canada

316
0:10:40,1 --> 0:10:41,64
It's all because of the woman.

317
0:10:41,64 --> 0:10:43,86
Haha, well, how should I put it?

318
0:10:43,86 --> 0:10:45,2
Back then, I thought about it.

319
0:10:45,2 --> 0:10:47,9
At that time, I had a girlfriend in Vancouver.

320
0:10:47,9 --> 0:10:50,5
And we dated for two years.

321
0:10:50,5 --> 0:10:50,93
Then we broke up.

322
0:10:50,93 --> 0:10:55,17
After that, when I found a new girlfriend,

323
0:10:55,17 --> 0:10:57,53
she was originally of Chinese descent,

324
0:10:57,53 --> 0:10:59,54
a Chinese person with Canadian citizenship.

325
0:10:59,54 --> 0:11:2,96
Later on, the girlfriends I dated came from various ethnic backgrounds.

326
0:11:2,96 --> 0:11:5,58
For instance, the girl I dated in Toronto,

327
0:11:5,58 --> 0:11:7,73
Leina is Polish.

328
0:11:7,73 --> 0:11:8,49
Polish.

329
0:11:8,49 --> 0:11:10,1
Later, I also interacted online,

330
0:11:10,1 --> 0:11:13,56
with someone from Montreal,

331
0:11:13,56 --> 0:11:15,64
and even with people from the U.S.

332
0:11:15,64 --> 0:11:18,88
I basically used this approach,

333
0:11:18,88 --> 0:11:20,36
to travel to new cities.

334
0:11:20,36 --> 0:11:22,9
As everyone knows, you're bound to meet one or two people

335
0:11:22,9 --> 0:11:24,16
and then travel together

336
0:11:24,16 --> 0:11:25,66
so you can explore during the day

337
0:11:25,66 --> 0:11:26,86
and at night as well, right?

338
0:11:26,86 --> 0:11:28,6
It's just more enjoyable

339
0:11:28,6 --> 0:11:30,89
making life less boring

340
0:11:30,89 --> 0:11:31,729
and interacting with people from different ethnicities

341
0:11:31,729 --> 0:11:34,169
and different countries, discussing the great harmony of life

342
0:11:34,169 --> 0:11:36,42
is also one of life's joys

343
0:11:36,42 --> 0:11:38,32
Actually, I was already 30 years old at that time.

344
0:11:38,32 --> 0:11:39,7
So it really doesn’t matter.

345
0:11:39,7 --> 0:11:42,78
But what’s most important is that I felt a lot of the time,

346
0:11:42,78 --> 0:11:44,54
your intuition is right.

347
0:11:44,54 --> 0:11:47,46
In reality, our education system,

348
0:11:47,46 --> 0:11:50,3
is often about learning from mistakes.

349
0:11:50,3 --> 0:11:52,48
It frequently tells you that you’re wrong,

350
0:11:52,48 --> 0:11:55,13
and you need to correct yourself to find the right answer.

351
0:11:55,13 --> 0:11:56,75
Seeing internet tycoons

352
0:11:56,75 --> 0:11:58,75
What ideas do they have that we can learn from?

353
0:11:58,75 --> 0:12:2,61
What knowledge or social experiences do they have in Japan for addressing societal issues?

354
0:12:2,61 --> 0:12:3,49
We should learn from them.

355
0:12:3,49 --> 0:12:4,89
What economic principles do they follow in the United States?

356
0:12:4,89 --> 0:12:5,94
We should learn from them.

357
0:12:5,94 --> 0:12:8,26
We are always criticizing ourselves.

358
0:12:8,26 --> 0:12:9,3
Thinking we are wrong.

359
0:12:9,3 --> 0:12:12,34
But nowadays, young people are much more confident.

360
0:12:12,34 --> 0:12:13,82
They believe they are right.

361
0:12:13,82 --> 0:12:14,38
That's it.

362
0:12:14,38 --> 0:12:16,19
Because individualism has been evolving.

363
0:12:16,19 --> 0:12:18,29
In the past, the mindset of collectivism was too dominant.

364
0:12:18,29 --> 0:12:19,37
Individualism is not sufficient

365
0:12:19,37 --> 0:12:21,95
So now I feel that collectivism and individualism

366
0:12:21,95 --> 0:12:24,729
They should coordinate the so-called Eastern and Western perspectives.

367
0:12:24,729 --> 0:12:25,869
Each should take up about half.

368
0:12:25,869 --> 0:12:28,369
But I feel there's a profound example.

369
0:12:28,369 --> 0:12:31,26
It's about us, the generation of the 80s.

370
0:12:31,26 --> 0:12:32,98
This time, we're not including the post-90s generation

371
0:12:32,98 --> 0:12:34,14
nor the post-70s generation

372
0:12:34,14 --> 0:12:36,46
it's the mindset of us, the post-80s generation

373
0:12:36,46 --> 0:12:39,58
because we grew up between the 1990s and elementary school

374
0:12:41,84 --> 0:12:46,3
to be honest, we need to ensure that reforms continue to progress steadily

375
0:12:46,3 --> 0:12:49,5
continuing to develop the economy is no easy task

376
0:12:49,5 --> 0:12:49,83
how can I put it

377
0:12:49,83 --> 0:12:53,15
so during that time, the control over our thoughts

378
0:12:53,15 --> 0:12:56,56
or the various forms of education we received

379
0:12:56,56 --> 0:12:57,7
it's not as common

380
0:12:57,7 --> 0:13:0,64
so the Gen Xers have a lot of mental stamps

381
0:13:0,64 --> 0:13:2,2
a lot of mental stamps

382
0:13:2,2 --> 0:13:5,42
which makes us hesitant to step out of line

383
0:13:5,42 --> 0:13:8,8
but look at the artists from our generation

384
0:13:8,8 --> 0:13:12,97
writers and filmmakers were more daring

385
0:13:12,97 --> 0:13:14,3
more adventurous

386
0:13:14,3 --> 0:13:18,37
most people are still quite obedient

387
0:13:18,37 --> 0:13:19,37
quite numb

388
0:13:19,37 --> 0:13:22,2
So you see, the mortality rate for those born in the 80s is higher.

389
0:13:22,2 --> 0:13:23,88
Mainly due to overwork.

390
0:13:23,88 --> 0:13:24,84
Serious illnesses as well.

391
0:13:24,84 --> 0:13:25,64
All kinds of people.

392
0:13:25,64 --> 0:13:26,6
It's our generation.

393
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:28,85
To be honest, we're the bridge between the old and the new.

394
0:13:28,85 --> 0:13:30,5
We tend to be more utilitarian.

395
0:13:30,5 --> 0:13:30,99
More conflicted.

396
0:13:30,99 --> 0:13:33,49
That's why I think we often feel this way.

397
0:13:33,49 --> 0:13:35,43
People our age

398
0:13:35,43 --> 0:13:38,9
the least we do is think about ourselves

399
0:13:38,9 --> 0:13:40,49
So you see, I have a malicious comment now.

400
0:13:40,49 --> 0:13:43,71
saying that I, Rong Zhen, am in my forties

401
0:13:43,71 --> 0:13:46,69
and talking about things that even a twenty-year-old dog could understand

402
0:13:46,69 --> 0:13:48,55
to a bunch of immature

403
0:13:48,55 --> 0:13:50,74
mentally flawed people

404
0:13:50,74 --> 0:13:54,98
First, what he thinks dogs can understand

405
0:13:54,98 --> 0:13:57,8
might really be within the reach of his social circle

406
0:13:57,8 --> 0:13:59,56
But when it comes to many things

407
0:13:59,56 --> 0:14:0,96
speaking for myself

408
0:14:0,96 --> 0:14:3,81
I feel like I only realized these in my thirties and forties

409
0:14:3,81 --> 0:14:5,33
or maybe I realized them in my twenties

410
0:14:5,33 --> 0:14:7,6
but I only articulated these truths in my thirties and forties

411
0:14:7,6 --> 0:14:9,16
My followers are countering him

412
0:14:9,16 --> 0:14:9,4
saying

413
0:14:9,4 --> 0:14:10,6
Brother Rong can break down these things

414
0:14:10,6 --> 0:14:14,56
the kind of family teachings that wealthy people have

415
0:14:14,56 --> 0:14:16,48
I'll share these insights separately with everyone.

416
0:14:16,48 --> 0:14:20,15
These are things people often only realize in their thirties or forties.

417
0:14:20,15 --> 0:14:21,79
It's beneficial to share these with people in their twenties.

418
0:14:21,79 --> 0:14:22,87
Actually, this is a good thing.

419
0:14:22,87 --> 0:14:24,49
I think this is a fairly objective view.

420
0:14:24,49 --> 0:14:25,87
This perspective is quite objective.

421
0:14:25,87 --> 0:14:27,15
And I've said a lot about this.

422
0:14:27,15 --> 0:14:28,39
Various aspects in the course of development,

423
0:14:28,39 --> 0:14:31,31
For instance, financial pitfalls and various traps.

424
0:14:31,31 --> 0:14:33,35
So why am I writing a book called 'Avoiding Pitfalls'?

425
0:14:33,35 --> 0:14:35,73
It’s to share these insights with everyone.

426
0:14:35,73 --> 0:14:37,17
Actually, a lot of the time,

427
0:14:37,17 --> 0:14:39,94
it’s like the taste of KFC’s chicken,

428
0:14:39,94 --> 0:14:41,38
you haven’t been wrong,

429
0:14:41,38 --> 0:14:43,1
your memory hasn’t betrayed you,

430
0:14:43,1 --> 0:14:44,4
you haven’t been wrong,

431
0:14:44,4 --> 0:14:46,88
you’ve been right from the start,

432
0:14:46,88 --> 0:14:49,66
but why does society insist on telling you that you’re wrong?

433
0:14:49,66 --> 0:14:52,84
The compliance test is more than just a test of compliance.

434
0:14:52,84 --> 0:14:54,3
It aims to strip away your individuality.

435
0:14:54,3 --> 0:14:57,22
To turn you into a tool for a specific purpose.

436
0:14:57,22 --> 0:14:59,3
Only then can certain collective objectives be achieved.

437
0:14:59,3 --> 0:15:1,52
There's a need for directional adjustments.

438
0:15:1,52 --> 0:15:3,36
But from your personal perspective,

439
0:15:3,36 --> 0:15:4,48
From an individual standpoint,

440
0:15:4,48 --> 0:15:5,76
We have both common and unique aspects.

441
0:15:5,76 --> 0:15:7,24
You are a member of society.

442
0:15:7,24 --> 0:15:9,28
The responsibilities and obligations you need to undertake

443
0:15:9,28 --> 0:15:10,71
That's definitely true

444
0:15:10,71 --> 0:15:12,43
Because you can't just focus on obligations

445
0:15:12,43 --> 0:15:13,49
Without considering responsibilities

446
0:15:13,49 --> 0:15:14,71
Focusing solely on responsibilities

447
0:15:14,71 --> 0:15:16,6
While neglecting obligations is also wrong

448
0:15:16,6 --> 0:15:18,7
The rights you enjoy are equal to the responsibilities you bear

449
0:15:18,7 --> 0:15:20,95
This is the state of a normal citizen

450
0:15:20,95 --> 0:15:25,63
But we shouldn't let this make you neglect your health and rest

451
0:15:25,63 --> 0:15:27,39
You're putting the cart before the horse here.

452
0:15:27,39 --> 0:15:29,68
If you don't develop your personal skills, they won't grow.

453
0:15:29,68 --> 0:15:31,6
You need to develop your personal skills.

454
0:15:31,6 --> 0:15:34,0
Only then can your essence move forward.

455
0:15:34,0 --> 0:15:35,26
Only then can you progress.

456
0:15:35,26 --> 0:15:37,78
And it's not about being a tool forever,

457
0:15:37,78 --> 0:15:39,599
living a mechanical life.

458
0:15:39,599 --> 0:15:41,599
It's about truly living for yourself.

459
0:15:41,599 --> 0:15:42,799
So you must understand this.

460
0:15:42,799 --> 0:15:45,65
Personal striving is the realization of personal value.

461
0:15:45,65 --> 0:15:46,83
The development of individuality.

462
0:15:46,83 --> 0:15:49,25
In terms of society, its impact is minor.

463
0:15:49,25 --> 0:15:50,29
But for the individual,

464
0:15:50,29 --> 0:15:51,81
its significance is immense.

465
0:15:51,81 --> 0:15:55,5
What we should truly pursue is the relationship between the individual and society.

466
0:15:55,5 --> 0:15:56,41
individual personality,

467
0:15:56,41 --> 0:15:59,329
a balance between individualism and collectivism

468
0:15:59,329 --> 0:16:1,609
Because in the true development stage of the economy,

469
0:16:1,609 --> 0:16:3,649
When you finally step into society,

470
0:16:3,649 --> 0:16:5,74
you'll find that not many people will really care about you.

471
0:16:5,74 --> 0:16:6,98
We follow the previous generation

472
0:16:6,98 --> 0:16:8,92
the people from the 1950s and 1960s, and the 1970s.

473
0:16:8,92 --> 0:16:11,3
Back then, a lot of things were managed,

474
0:16:11,3 --> 0:16:12,48
the state would take care of you.

475
0:16:12,48 --> 0:16:13,68
For instance,

476
0:16:13,68 --> 0:16:16,65
if you entered large factories or major enterprises, the state would look after you,

477
0:16:16,65 --> 0:16:17,95
from birth to death.

478
0:16:17,95 --> 0:16:18,81
Your retirement

479
0:16:18,81 --> 0:16:20,57
your parenting and all that are your responsibility

480
0:16:20,57 --> 0:16:22,53
but our generation, the market economy generation

481
0:16:22,53 --> 0:16:24,79
they leave a lot of things unattended

482
0:16:24,79 --> 0:16:26,359
we have entered a society obsessed with material desires

483
0:16:26,359 --> 0:16:27,599
you need to earn money

484
0:16:27,599 --> 0:16:28,759
earning money brings you peace of mind

485
0:16:28,759 --> 0:16:29,79
Why is it that our generation

486
0:16:29,79 --> 0:16:32,7
is so fixated on controlling money

487
0:16:32,7 --> 0:16:32,87
That's how it is.

488
0:16:32,87 --> 0:16:33,69
They're all tightwads.

489
0:16:33,69 --> 0:16:34,75
Sometimes, you know,

490
0:16:34,75 --> 0:16:37,35
I think Generation Z and Millennials spend money more freely than we do.

491
0:16:37,35 --> 0:16:39,95
Generation X really doesn't spend much on themselves these days.

492
0:16:39,95 --> 0:16:41,31
But they're willing to spend on their families.

493
0:16:41,31 --> 0:16:42,35
So, a lot of the time,

494
0:16:42,35 --> 0:16:45,85
Our generation isn't heavily controlled by Consumer One.

495
0:16:45,85 --> 0:16:47,15
but Generation Z and Millennials are more so.

496
0:16:47,15 --> 0:16:48,3
Especially the post-90s generation

497
0:16:48,3 --> 0:16:50,31
Because the post-90s generation has a much better family background than we do

498
0:16:53,5 --> 0:16:53,86
Over there

499
0:16:53,86 --> 0:16:57,95
There are also those Chinese and Japanese teenagers participating in a rally race in Inner Mongolia

500
0:16:57,95 --> 0:16:59,75
The influence of Yilin is particularly significant

501
0:16:59,75 --> 0:17:2,77
So our generation, to be honest, is kind of like

502
0:17:2,77 --> 0:17:5,8
Shielding the bullets of the past era

503
0:17:5,8 --> 0:17:5,74
You know?

504
0:17:5,74 --> 0:17:7,26
Like Wu Li Qi, for example

505
0:17:7,26 --> 0:17:9,5
Over these three years

506
0:17:9,5 --> 0:17:11,92
they've enjoyed the benefits of this era

507
0:17:11,92 --> 0:17:13,14
but we haven't

508
0:17:13,14 --> 0:17:16,72
For the generation of 99010

509
0:17:16,72 --> 0:17:19,3
they've experienced the country's strength

510
0:17:19,3 --> 0:17:21,34
and the benefits of being a developed nation

511
0:17:21,34 --> 0:17:22,94
which we can't really feel

512
0:17:22,94 --> 0:17:25,2
We are the middle-aged generation in between

513
0:17:25,2 --> 0:17:27,62
so we lack the enthusiasm and drive of the younger generation

514
0:17:27,62 --> 0:17:29,66
So, the generation born in the 80s has had a tough time.

515
0:17:29,66 --> 0:17:30,94
That's what I'm trying to say.

516
0:17:30,94 --> 0:17:33,259
This is my recent train of thought.

517
0:17:33,259 --> 0:17:35,599
The first step of the reflective trilogy

518
0:17:35,599 --> 0:17:36,379
No rush.

519
0:17:36,379 --> 0:17:37,739
This is just the first step.

520
0:17:37,739 --> 0:17:38,939
If you want to see the best part,

521
0:17:38,939 --> 0:17:39,77
It's coming up.

522
0:17:39,77 --> 0:17:43,13
So today we're talking about this intuitive feeling.

523
0:17:43,13 --> 0:17:45,35
If you think you're not at fault

524
0:17:45,35 --> 0:17:48,31
you might not have found the evidence at the time

525
0:17:48,31 --> 0:17:49,53
Look at me after all these years

526
0:17:49,53 --> 0:17:53,18
I started eating KFC when I was six

527
0:17:53,18 --> 0:17:55,4
and by my teens, I noticed the taste had changed

528
0:17:55,4 --> 0:17:55,68
by my twenties

529
0:17:55,68 --> 0:17:58,94
I really felt that KFC wasn't as good as it was when I was a kid

530
0:17:58,94 --> 0:18:0,14
maybe it's because I grew up

531
0:18:0,14 --> 0:18:3,28
and by the time I hit 30, I finally tasted the original KFC again

532
0:18:3,28 --> 0:18:5,6
The authentic KFC flavor in the Black neighborhood

533
0:18:5,6 --> 0:18:8,44
The authentic KFC flavor in the northeastern corner of North America

534
0:18:8,44 --> 0:18:10,889
Turns out it really is the same taste

535
0:18:10,889 --> 0:18:12,409
And while other places might have changed

536
0:18:12,409 --> 0:18:14,549
But in this part of North America, with a large Black population

537
0:18:14,549 --> 0:18:15,9
The taste has remained unchanged

538
0:18:15,9 --> 0:18:17,38
So the flavor has been consistently improved

539
0:18:17,38 --> 0:18:19,28
It’s possible they’ve been making improvements there too

540
0:18:19,28 --> 0:18:21,3
But it triggers the taste buds just like in my memories

541
0:18:21,3 --> 0:18:22,52
His memory was triggered

542
0:18:22,52 --> 0:18:24,23
resulting in a perfect blend

543
0:18:24,23 --> 0:18:25,35
So often

544
0:18:25,35 --> 0:18:27,65
the biggest intellectual challenge for our generation

545
0:18:27,65 --> 0:18:29,65
is self-doubt

546
0:18:29,65 --> 0:18:33,3
conforming to the choices of the group

547
0:18:33,3 --> 0:18:34,7
aligning with societal choices

548
0:18:34,7 --> 0:18:36,14
aligning with our parents' choices

549
0:18:36,14 --> 0:18:38,7
leaving little room for personal consideration

550
0:18:38,7 --> 0:18:40,27
A lot of things just go with the flow.

551
0:18:40,27 --> 0:18:42,17
It’s better to admit that you’re wrong,

552
0:18:42,17 --> 0:18:43,41
than to refuse to acknowledge

553
0:18:43,41 --> 0:18:44,73
that you might actually be right

554
0:18:44,73 --> 0:18:46,36
and different from society.

555
0:18:46,36 --> 0:18:48,0
That’s the scariest part.

556
0:18:48,0 --> 0:18:50,92
This is why when the post-90s generation emerged,

557
0:18:50,92 --> 0:18:51,72
we felt that for us,

558
0:18:51,72 --> 0:18:54,16
the post-80s generation brought a significant ideological impact.

559
0:18:54,16 --> 0:18:57,0
Just because these post-90s, the Zang'ai Family members

560
0:18:57,0 --> 0:18:58,9
They dare to think and act

561
0:18:58,9 --> 0:19:0,32
Their parents are from the 60s

562
0:19:0,32 --> 0:19:1,16
And the 70s

563
0:19:1,16 --> 0:19:2,8
They have more money

564
0:19:2,8 --> 0:19:3,68
More knowledge

565
0:19:3,68 --> 0:19:4,74
More confidence

566
0:19:4,74 --> 0:19:6,75
And fewer historical burdens

567
0:19:6,75 --> 0:19:8,29
The post-90s dare to perm their hair

568
0:19:8,29 --> 0:19:9,83
The post-90s dare to play Dance Dance Revolution

569
0:19:9,83 --> 0:19:11,19
Dare to engage in all sorts of

570
0:19:11,19 --> 0:19:13,87
So why do post-80s and post-90s tend to marry each other more often?

571
0:19:13,87 --> 0:19:15,43
Indeed, this is complementary

572
0:19:15,43 --> 0:19:17,28
Many times, I really feel that the post-90s

573
0:19:17,28 --> 0:19:19,52
The post-00s are 20 years younger than me

574
0:19:19,52 --> 0:19:21,16
The post-90s are only 10 years younger than me

575
0:19:21,16 --> 0:19:23,76
So, the interaction between post-80s and post-90s is the most frequent

576
0:19:23,76 --> 0:19:26,78
I really admire the individuality of the post-90s from the bottom of my heart

577
0:19:26,78 --> 0:19:28,2
So I think that Chinese generations change every ten years

578
0:19:28,2 --> 0:19:31,23
We must stay within this cultural context

579
0:19:31,23 --> 0:19:33,43
Only within the country can you truly reflect the differences between generations

580
0:19:33,43 --> 0:19:36,71
The differences between different people

581
0:19:36,71 --> 0:19:38,6
The differences in social and ideological trends are interesting

582
0:19:38,6 --> 0:19:40,98
So I think, uh

583
0:19:40,98 --> 0:19:42,76
We always need to continuously analyze these things

584
0:19:42,76 --> 0:19:45,6
And see how different generations

585
0:19:45,6 --> 0:19:47,2
Feel about the same things completely differently

586
0:19:47,2 --> 0:19:49,96
So we say that what post-80s really need to do is

587
0:19:49,96 --> 0:19:53,32
Not to deny your memories

588
0:19:53,32 --> 0:19:55,71
Not to deny your intuition

589
0:19:55,71 --> 0:19:57,71
Not to deny your personal subjective feelings

590
0:19:57,71 --> 0:20:0,96
And not to conform to the so-called correct answers imposed by collectivism

591
0:20:0,96 --> 0:20:4,0
and don't succumb to the pressures of collectivism that are imposed on you

592
0:20:4,0 --> 0:20:5,36
So many times it's like this

593
0:20:5,36 --> 0:20:7,55
Especially in essays, there are no correct answers

594
0:20:7,55 --> 0:20:9,35
Everything should be expressed

595
0:20:9,35 --> 0:20:11,639
Express your own thoughts

596
0:20:11,639 --> 0:20:13,359
Develop your own thoughts

597
0:20:13,359 --> 0:20:14,739
If you don't even dare to develop your own thoughts

598
0:20:14,739 --> 0:20:16,2
How can you become a knowledge blogger?

599
0:20:16,2 --> 0:20:18,28
How can you become a teacher?

600
0:20:18,28 --> 0:20:19,9
How can you become a researcher?

601
0:20:19,9 --> 0:20:21,22
Right?

602
0:20:21,22 --> 0:20:22,86
If you can't even doubt everything

603
0:20:22,86 --> 0:20:23,38
How can you possess a scientific spirit?

604
0:20:23,38 --> 0:20:25,2
The spirit of science is to doubt everything

605
0:20:25,2 --> 0:20:26,969
This is very important

606
0:20:26,969 --> 0:20:28,969
So you need to have the courage to say

607
0:20:28,969 --> 0:20:30,209
You dare to doubt the world

608
0:20:30,209 --> 0:20:32,609
I am right

609
0:20:32,609 --> 0:20:33,989
There's something wrong with the world

610
0:20:33,989 --> 0:20:34,769
I am right

611
0:20:34,769 --> 0:20:35,75
The Mandela Effect issues, I am right

612
0:20:35,75 --> 0:20:36,65
In many cases

613
0:20:36,65 --> 0:20:38,83
I need to find evidence that I am right

614
0:20:38,83 --> 0:20:39,55
So the spirit of getting to the root of things

615
0:20:39,55 --> 0:20:41,15
The post-90s have it, the post-00s have it, and the post-10s have it even more

616
0:20:41,15 --> 0:20:42,81
So I think, when it comes to Chinese generations, each one is better than the last

617
0:20:42,81 --> 0:20:46,24
Each generation has its own Shangganling

618
0:20:46,24 --> 0:20:48,96
Each generation also has its own Waterloo

619
0:20:48,96 --> 0:20:51,36
Each generation has its own Shangganling

620
0:20:51,36 --> 0:20:53,62
Every generation has its own Waterloo

621
0:20:53,62 --> 0:20:55,0
As long as each generation is stronger than the last

622
0:20:55,0 --> 0:20:56,1
As long as human society continues to progress

623
0:20:56,1 --> 0:20:58,45
This is also what I admire about young people

624
0:20:58,45 --> 0:21:0,1
Human society just needs to move forward.

625
0:21:0,1 --> 0:21:2,57
Believe in your intuition

626
0:21:2,57 --> 0:21:4,429
Don't always think you're wrong

627
0:21:4,429 --> 0:21:5,809
The world might be wrong
