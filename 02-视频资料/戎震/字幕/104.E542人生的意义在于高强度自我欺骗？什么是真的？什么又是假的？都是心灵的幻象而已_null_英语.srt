1
0:0:0,68 --> 0:0:2,3
There have been frequent updates recently

2
0:0:2,3 --> 0:0:4,14
The wind is howling outside

3
0:0:6,12 --> 0:0:7,52
And it’s been raining non-stop

4
0:0:7,52 --> 0:0:9,58
Why did I suddenly want to do another update today?

5
0:0:9,58 --> 0:0:11,14
Actually, it’s quite simple

6
0:0:11,49 --> 0:0:14,51
I was posting on my social media and suddenly felt a bit down

7
0:0:14,51 --> 0:0:15,31
Why is that?

8
0:0:15,31 --> 0:0:17,69
Because I thought about a deeply rooted issue

9
0:0:17,69 --> 0:0:23,5
That the happiness in life comes from intense self-deception

10
0:0:23,5 --> 0:0:27,119
Many people refuse to draw a clear line with reality

11
0:0:27,119 --> 0:0:29,779
always feeling that they should live in an ideal world

12
0:0:29,779 --> 0:0:32,639
but one day, they will wake up to the reality

13
0:0:32,639 --> 0:0:35,25
and realize that the real world is not what they imagined

14
0:0:35,25 --> 0:0:37,63
leading to disappointment with reality

15
0:0:37,63 --> 0:0:39,9
thinking that the world needs to be saved

16
0:0:39,9 --> 0:0:40,77
but in fact, the world has always been this way

17
0:0:40,77 --> 0:0:42,33
it doesn’t need to be saved

18
0:0:42,33 --> 0:0:45,53
it’s just that you need to understand the inherent laws of the world

19
0:0:45,53 --> 0:0:46,819
Still don't get it

20
0:0:46,819 --> 0:0:49,819
Why do you say life is about intense self-deception?

21
0:0:49,819 --> 0:0:53,459
Because when people live in reality

22
0:0:53,459 --> 0:0:55,4
they can't handle it

23
0:0:55,4 --> 0:0:57,18
the true state of human beings

24
0:0:57,18 --> 0:1:0,16
is often something they can't perceive

25
0:1:0,16 --> 0:1:2,46
like the fall of Miss Dong

26
0:1:2,46 --> 0:1:5,92
do you really think the fall of Miss Dong means

27
0:1:5,92 --> 0:1:7,28
better days are ahead?'

28
0:1:7,28 --> 0:1:8,36
Actually, that's not the case.

29
0:1:8,36 --> 0:1:10,64
But I don't think it's a bad thing.

30
0:1:10,64 --> 0:1:13,7
Because you need to realize that.

31
0:1:13,35 --> 0:1:16,29
You've read the novel 'Blood Red Romance,' right?

32
0:1:16,29 --> 0:1:17,11
Isn't that right?

33
0:1:17,11 --> 0:1:19,81
And you've seen the early films directed by Feng Xiaogang, haven't you?

34
0:1:19,81 --> 0:1:23,63
So often, the fate of the rich and the poor ends up differently.

35
0:1:23,63 --> 0:1:25,29
The ultimate outcomes are different.

36
0:1:25,29 --> 0:1:27,33
Even if you have the same skills as Xiao Huang Dan.

37
0:1:27,33 --> 0:1:29,5
You won’t outdo Zhong Yuemin either.

38
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:30,32
It’s the same principle.

39
0:1:30,32 --> 0:1:31,7
So no matter what,

40
0:1:31,7 --> 0:1:32,46
you need to understand that

41
0:1:32,46 --> 0:1:36,2
everyone’s ultimate outcome is different.

42
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:39,69
So what kind of difference should you create in your life?

43
0:1:39,69 --> 0:1:40,61
This is crucial.

44
0:1:40,61 --> 0:1:43,97
That is to say, life is about intense self-deception,

45
0:1:43,97 --> 0:1:44,69
its fundamental meaning.

46
0:1:44,69 --> 0:1:48,3
It's about giving your own life meaning.

47
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:50,71
It's not about the meaning others impose on it.

48
0:1:50,71 --> 0:1:53,45
After all, good people don't always get good outcomes.

49
0:1:53,45 --> 0:1:54,96
And bad people don't always face consequences.

50
0:1:54,96 --> 0:1:56,7
Things might not always feel fair.

51
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:58,96
Hard work doesn't always lead to success.

52
0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:0,92
Sometimes, the slow and steady don't need to start early.

53
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:4,96
Often, others might have an advantageous position.

54
0:2:4,96 --> 0:2:7,21
This can make it hard for you to progress further.

55
0:2:7,21 --> 0:2:8,81
Sometimes it's just like that

56
0:2:8,81 --> 0:2:12,79
Why does Teacher Dabing say we should cultivate longevity and walk the narrow path?

57
0:2:12,79 --> 0:2:14,21
Sometimes it's just like that

58
0:2:14,21 --> 0:2:17,23
So if you let that stop you

59
0:2:17,23 --> 0:2:19,299
If you stop putting in the effort

60
0:2:19,299 --> 0:2:20,779
If you give up on moving forward

61
0:2:20,779 --> 0:2:22,759
Then your life is over

62
0:2:22,759 --> 0:2:24,91
So from the moment you feel disappointed

63
0:2:24,91 --> 0:2:27,35
You shouldn't be an idealist anymore

64
0:2:27,35 --> 0:2:28,75
You should be a realist.

65
0:2:28,75 --> 0:2:30,15
A realist is someone who

66
0:2:30,15 --> 0:2:32,27
no matter what cards reality deals me,

67
0:2:32,27 --> 0:2:34,11
no matter what situation I find myself in,

68
0:2:34,11 --> 0:2:35,3
I play them to the best of my ability.

69
0:2:35,3 --> 0:2:36,47
I turn the tables and win.

70
0:2:36,47 --> 0:2:37,37
It's that simple.

71
0:2:37,37 --> 0:2:38,7
No matter what happens,

72
0:2:38,7 --> 0:2:39,43
I always strive to do better.

73
0:2:39,43 --> 0:2:40,85
But no matter what

74
0:2:40,85 --> 0:2:42,73
your outcome might not be truly good

75
0:2:42,73 --> 0:2:44,87
but when you accept everything

76
0:2:44,87 --> 0:2:46,95
and can still carry on positively

77
0:2:46,95 --> 0:2:48,5
then it’s okay

78
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:52,85
so many things, if you always focus on gains and losses in reality

79
0:2:52,85 --> 0:2:54,31
in reality

80
0:2:54,31 --> 0:2:55,13
how to put it

81
0:2:55,13 --> 0:2:58,45
some feelings that inspire you

82
0:2:58,45 --> 0:3:0,29
If you take this as your benchmark

83
0:3:0,29 --> 0:3:3,42
your real life will be tough to get through

84
0:3:3,82 --> 0:3:9,14
I would say no one has given me the wisdom to survive

85
0:3:9,14 --> 0:3:11,2
more than I have given myself

86
0:3:11,2 --> 0:3:15,3
the meaning of life still lies in convincing yourself

87
0:3:15,3 --> 0:3:18,3
you have to tell yourself that these things are meaningful

88
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:22,4
you have to believe that you are a very fortunate person

89
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:23,24
you have to believe in yourself

90
0:3:23,24 --> 0:3:25,0
this life is definitely meaningful

91
0:3:25,0 --> 0:3:26,84
What would you say for sure?

92
0:3:26,84 --> 0:3:27,56
The chosen one

93
0:3:27,56 --> 0:3:29,28
You have to believe in yourself first

94
0:3:29,28 --> 0:3:31,14
Only then will the heavens truly help you

95
0:3:31,14 --> 0:3:33,2
This is a cause-and-effect relationship

96
0:3:33,2 --> 0:3:35,4
It’s about building something from nothing

97
0:3:35,4 --> 0:3:36,68
From the false to the true

98
0:3:36,68 --> 0:3:38,2
That’s the process

99
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:40,42
From the start, when no one believed

100
0:3:40,42 --> 0:3:42,2
Until one or two people believe

101
0:3:42,2 --> 0:3:43,18
Until everyone believes

102
0:3:43,18 --> 0:3:44,3
When everyone believes

103
0:3:44,3 --> 0:3:46,6
It will become true

104
0:3:46,6 --> 0:3:48,5
And there is a cause and effect between things

105
0:3:48,5 --> 0:3:50,2
Like the videos I make

106
0:3:50,2 --> 0:3:51,1
The videos I make and the books I write

107
0:3:51,1 --> 0:3:52,53
Now they have helped many people

108
0:3:52,53 --> 0:3:54,89
But from the perspective of these books and videos

109
0:3:54,89 --> 0:3:56,43
Did it come out of nothing?

110
0:3:56,43 --> 0:3:59,71
How did this process of energy storage come about?

111
0:3:59,71 --> 0:4:1,67
Now it's in a state of emission.

112
0:4:1,67 --> 0:4:2,87
I made a video.

113
0:4:2,87 --> 0:4:3,79
You saw it.

114
0:4:3,79 --> 0:4:4,91
You were inspired.

115
0:4:4,91 --> 0:4:6,87
So where do these videos come from?

116
0:4:6,87 --> 0:4:9,51
Did they just appear out of thin air?

117
0:4:9,51 --> 0:4:11,71
No, they come from all the hardships I've endured.

118
0:4:11,71 --> 0:4:12,89
The path we've walked

119
0:4:12,89 --> 0:4:16,58
The traps we've dug, we find ourselves stuck in

120
0:4:16,58 --> 0:4:18,58
And then we rely on our own efforts to get out

121
0:4:18,58 --> 0:4:20,84
So this process

122
0:4:20,84 --> 0:4:24,1
Everything has a state of accumulating energy and layering up

123
0:4:24,1 --> 0:4:26,44
It's certainly not going to be simple at the very beginning

124
0:4:26,44 --> 0:4:28,6
It won't just start off so easily

125
0:4:28,6 --> 0:4:30,3
It definitely takes time

126
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:31,64
It's gradually achieved

127
0:4:31,64 --> 0:4:34,78
So you can't give up just because something doesn't yield immediate results.

128
0:4:34,78 --> 0:4:36,1
You shouldn't completely stop trying.

129
0:4:36,1 --> 0:4:39,0
Things don't change overnight.

130
0:4:39,0 --> 0:4:40,84
You shouldn't undermine today's value just because you don't see immediate change.

131
0:4:40,84 --> 0:4:42,92
Because the world is shaped by countless days,

132
0:4:42,92 --> 0:4:45,62
by countless individuals.

133
0:4:45,62 --> 0:4:47,62
And the most important point is,

134
0:4:47,62 --> 0:4:51,64
you shouldn't rely too much on external feedback.

135
0:4:51,64 --> 0:4:54,64
Instead, you should rely on the feedback from your own inner world.

136
0:4:54,64 --> 0:4:57,57
Feedback from the external world is often delayed.

137
0:4:57,57 --> 0:4:59,87
This is a symbiotic illusion.

138
0:4:59,87 --> 0:5:3,55
But in your own heart, it's an independent illusion.

139
0:5:3,55 --> 0:5:5,39
They are both illusions.

140
0:5:5,39 --> 0:5:7,519
Speaking of the consensus illusion outside,

141
0:5:7,519 --> 0:5:8,999
It's the world we walk through.

142
0:5:8,999 --> 0:5:11,24
The process of interacting with others.

143
0:5:11,24 --> 0:5:13,8
Receiving encouragement from others in the real world.

144
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:15,2
Receiving praise from others.

145
0:5:15,2 --> 0:5:16,84
Getting recognition from others

146
0:5:16,84 --> 0:5:18,58
is often a luxury

147
0:5:18,58 --> 0:5:20,97
and you have to do a lot to earn it

148
0:5:20,97 --> 0:5:22,89
but if you have a good relationship with your parents

149
0:5:22,89 --> 0:5:24,21
or if you have very close friends

150
0:5:24,21 --> 0:5:26,37
you might receive these things from them

151
0:5:26,37 --> 0:5:27,65
but they also have their own needs

152
0:5:27,65 --> 0:5:29,3
and expectations

153
0:5:29,3 --> 0:5:33,5
who in this world can provide you with unlimited recognition

154
0:5:33,5 --> 0:5:34,1
Your needs

155
0:5:34,1 --> 0:5:35,75
Some psychological cues

156
0:5:35,75 --> 0:5:37,429
Only you can do that

157
0:5:37,429 --> 0:5:39,989
Many people often give themselves so-called motivation

158
0:5:39,989 --> 0:5:40,349
Yourself

159
0:5:40,349 --> 0:5:41,169
So-called

160
0:5:41,169 --> 0:5:42,749
Don't be afraid of becoming too proud

161
0:5:42,749 --> 0:5:45,88
It's not about the kind of interaction with parents

162
0:5:45,88 --> 0:5:47,34
Once you focus on yourself

163
0:5:47,34 --> 0:5:50,26
He is also in a constant state of anxiety.

164
0:5:50,26 --> 0:5:51,38
A constant anxiety.

165
0:5:51,38 --> 0:5:52,78
A constant sense of dissatisfaction.

166
0:5:52,78 --> 0:5:55,64
He uses this fear to drive himself.

167
0:5:55,64 --> 0:5:57,92
When he sees the data come in.

168
0:5:57,92 --> 0:6:0,4
When he sees his income decrease.

169
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:1,7
When he realizes his youth is gone.

170
0:6:1,7 --> 0:6:3,14
When he sees others surpass him.

171
0:6:3,14 --> 0:6:4,679
He feels a sense of crisis.

172
0:6:4,679 --> 0:6:6,75
But such things can't last long.

173
0:6:6,75 --> 0:6:8,29
Such things can't last long.

174
0:6:8,29 --> 0:6:10,67
When in reality you can't quickly

175
0:6:10,67 --> 0:6:12,31
change your current situation,

176
0:6:12,31 --> 0:6:14,29
you'll fall into a greater crisis.

177
0:6:14,29 --> 0:6:16,37
you'll fall into deeper self-doubt.

178
0:6:16,37 --> 0:6:17,47
This is not the way to go.

179
0:6:17,47 --> 0:6:21,48
So you need something that, no matter how well or poorly you perform,

180
0:6:21,48 --> 0:6:23,26
you should encourage yourself.

181
0:6:23,26 --> 0:6:25,34
No matter whether you gain or lose in reality

182
0:6:25,34 --> 0:6:27,39
you should believe in yourself

183
0:6:27,39 --> 0:6:29,75
no matter what your personal creed is

184
0:6:29,75 --> 0:6:32,55
for example, many people's creed is to live for themselves

185
0:6:32,55 --> 0:6:34,19
or you can live for the people

186
0:6:34,19 --> 0:6:37,36
both self-centered and other-centered approaches are valid

187
0:6:37,36 --> 0:6:39,24
in the end, you'll find that whether you're living for others or for yourself

188
0:6:39,24 --> 0:6:42,51
it will all come down to the same level

189
0:6:42,51 --> 0:6:44,87
it's a process where different paths lead to the same destination

190
0:6:44,87 --> 0:6:46,43
So no matter what you think

191
0:6:46,43 --> 0:6:48,2
I just want to live in a big house

192
0:6:48,2 --> 0:6:50,24
I just want to make my life better

193
0:6:50,24 --> 0:6:53,179
or I just want to improve the lives of the people

194
0:6:53,179 --> 0:6:54,859
These are all great things

195
0:6:54,859 --> 0:6:57,73
But these things fall into the realm of idealism

196
0:6:57,73 --> 0:6:59,53
Idealistic things

197
0:6:59,53 --> 0:7:1,53
What kind of inspiration can they offer you?

198
0:7:1,53 --> 0:7:3,97
The thing itself is impossible to achieve

199
0:7:3,97 --> 0:7:6,3
But the heart can yearn for it.

200
0:7:6,3 --> 0:7:8,1
You can pretend it has been achieved.

201
0:7:8,1 --> 0:7:10,22
Or you can pretend you have the ability to achieve it.

202
0:7:10,22 --> 0:7:12,48
Or you can pretend you are the chosen one.

203
0:7:12,48 --> 0:7:13,58
It's that simple.

204
0:7:13,58 --> 0:7:16,5
So much of the time, it comes down to the power of faith.

205
0:7:16,5 --> 0:7:19,24
Faith itself is like water without a source.

206
0:7:19,24 --> 0:7:20,82
You may never encounter deities in your lifetime.

207
0:7:20,82 --> 0:7:22,909
Nor will you ever see what God truly looks like.

208
0:7:22,909 --> 0:7:25,589
You can only wander aimlessly throughout your life.

209
0:7:25,589 --> 0:7:28,6
In the darkness, you blindly believe.

210
0:7:28,6 --> 0:7:29,84
All religions tell you,

211
0:7:29,84 --> 0:7:30,56
This one tells you,

212
0:7:30,56 --> 0:7:33,32
That one tells you about various deities,

213
0:7:33,32 --> 0:7:34,0
What this one is like,

214
0:7:34,0 --> 0:7:34,6
What that one is like,

215
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:37,32
But in reality, you never actually see what these beings truly look like.

216
0:7:37,32 --> 0:7:41,34
Instead, they create a kind of illusory realm for you.

217
0:7:41,34 --> 0:7:43,44
These things can truly inspire you

218
0:7:43,44 --> 0:7:46,14
it's the parables within them that do

219
0:7:46,14 --> 0:7:48,49
the philosophical insights can assist you

220
0:7:48,49 --> 0:7:51,11
it's the teachings of the great masters that stand out

221
0:7:51,11 --> 0:7:52,81
the knowledge they have uncovered

222
0:7:52,81 --> 0:7:55,7
can truly help you transform your current situation

223
0:7:55,7 --> 0:7:58,38
or guide you to a better life

224
0:7:58,38 --> 0:8:1,64
whether you adhere to these precepts or not

225
0:8:1,64 --> 0:8:3,49
regardless of how you choose to act

226
0:8:3,49 --> 0:8:4,65
No matter if it's still you

227
0:8:4,65 --> 0:8:7,25
From the philosophical insights of this secular world

228
0:8:7,25 --> 0:8:8,87
It's also about reflecting certain things

229
0:8:8,87 --> 0:8:9,79
Regardless of how it is

230
0:8:9,79 --> 0:8:12,47
Life is about intense self-deception

231
0:8:12,47 --> 0:8:15,1
Faith is a form of deception

232
0:8:15,26 --> 0:8:17,66
The principles you seek in life

233
0:8:17,66 --> 0:8:18,97
Are also a form of deception

234
0:8:18,97 --> 0:8:21,47
This deception is about making the false seem real

235
0:8:21,47 --> 0:8:24,289
So, what is actually true?

236
0:8:24,289 --> 0:8:26,849
The truth is often hard to define.

237
0:8:26,849 --> 0:8:28,409
Most of it is false.

238
0:8:28,409 --> 0:8:32,0
From 0 to 99, it’s all false.

239
0:8:32,0 --> 0:8:33,64
It’s only true at 100 percent.

240
0:8:33,64 --> 0:8:34,65
That’s when it’s real.

241
0:8:34,65 --> 0:8:36,93
But this 100, this perfect state,

242
0:8:36,93 --> 0:8:37,85
It becomes one.

243
0:8:37,85 --> 0:8:40,9
So, speaking of truth, it’s a state of perfection.

244
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:41,99
It's a state of saturation

245
0:8:41,99 --> 0:8:45,83
while most of the false states are imperfect and incomplete

246
0:8:45,83 --> 0:8:47,52
that's what makes them real

247
0:8:47,52 --> 0:8:49,72
meaning that what is false is actually true

248
0:8:49,72 --> 0:8:51,72
while what is true is only momentary

249
0:8:51,72 --> 0:8:54,19
the true state is a fleeting moment

250
0:8:54,19 --> 0:8:55,65
and thus harder to find

251
0:8:55,65 --> 0:8:58,81
so you shouldn't pursue the true things

252
0:8:58,81 --> 0:9:1,1
have faith in yourself

253
0:9:1,1 --> 0:9:2,69
including all these things

254
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:3,95
including your self-validation

255
0:9:3,95 --> 0:9:5,83
these should all be like water without a root

256
0:9:5,83 --> 0:9:9,31
so you should never seek others' approval of you

257
0:9:9,31 --> 0:9:10,65
others' love for you

258
0:9:10,65 --> 0:9:12,97
all sorts of support from others

259
0:9:12,97 --> 0:9:15,73
you should seek self-approval

260
0:9:15,73 --> 0:9:17,819
because you are the one who empowers yourself

261
0:9:17,819 --> 0:9:19,579
you must first empower yourself

262
0:9:19,579 --> 0:9:21,239
define your own function first

263
0:9:21,239 --> 0:9:22,979
only then can you truly accomplish everything

264
0:9:24,59 --> 0:9:26,45
so it all starts with yourself

265
0:9:26,45 --> 0:9:28,67
narcissists remain invincible by being consistently self-absorbed

266
0:9:28,67 --> 0:9:30,33
it's that simple

267
0:9:30,33 --> 0:9:31,69
so no matter what

268
0:9:31,69 --> 0:9:33,99
don't think that just because you don't have anything real in your hands

269
0:9:33,99 --> 0:9:35,85
you can't achieve everything

270
0:9:35,85 --> 0:9:36,869
that's not the case

271
0:9:36,869 --> 0:9:38,669
for all narcissists

272
0:9:38,669 --> 0:9:41,29
they don't need real things to support them

273
0:9:41,29 --> 0:9:42,93
they can distort reality

274
0:9:42,93 --> 0:9:45,9
you can also refuse to acknowledge this reality

275
0:9:45,9 --> 0:9:47,1
so this is what I want to tell you

276
0:9:47,1 --> 0:9:49,8
the meaning of life lies in high-intensity self-deception
