0:0:0,38 --> 0:0:1,64
Hey, 519

2
0:0:1,64 --> 0:0:5,31
Today, let's talk about the differences in mindset between the poor and the rich.

3
0:0:5,31 --> 0:0:8,31
Just take entrepreneurship as an example.

4
0:0:8,31 --> 0:0:11,29
The gap between the poor and the rich is quite significant.

5
0:0:11,29 --> 0:0:14,2
So, why are wealthy people wealthy?

6
0:0:14,2 --> 0:0:15,62
It's not just because they have money.

7
0:0:15,62 --> 0:0:16,5
That's what makes them wealthy.

8
0:0:16,5 --> 0:0:19,16
Rather, their awareness and thought patterns

9
0:0:19,16 --> 0:0:21,85
Their methodologies and approaches differ from those of the poor.

10
0:0:21,85 --> 0:0:24,9
His ability to accumulate such wealth

11
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:25,75
is closely tied to the choices he made.

12
0:0:25,75 --> 0:0:27,89
It's not just the act of starting a business

13
0:0:27,89 --> 0:0:28,83
that made him wealthy.

14
0:0:28,83 --> 0:0:29,81
That's not the case.

15
0:0:29,81 --> 0:0:31,83
From any perspective,

16
0:0:31,83 --> 0:0:33,27
this endeavor

17
0:0:33,27 --> 0:0:35,12
starting a business

18
0:0:35,24 --> 0:0:38,16
and venturing into new enterprises are incredibly challenging.

19
0:0:38,16 --> 0:0:40,35
But for different people,

20
0:0:40,35 --> 0:0:41,67
the strategies vary.

21
0:0:41,67 --> 0:0:44,5
So you often hear people say,

22
0:0:44,5 --> 0:0:46,59
in this day and age, teaching people to start businesses,

23
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:48,51
is just shameless.

24
0:0:48,51 --> 0:0:51,33
The failure rate of startups is 99%. 

25
0:0:51,33 --> 0:0:52,63
Listen to this sentence,

26
0:0:52,63 --> 0:0:55,93
people who talk like this are usually poor themselves.

27
0:0:55,93 --> 0:1:0,89
The life of the poor is always driven by fear.

28
0:1:0,89 --> 0:1:2,35
You can't afford not to study.

29
0:1:2,35 --> 0:1:4,68
If you don't study, you won't find a job when you grow up.

30
0:1:4,68 --> 0:1:6,14
You can't be without a job.

31
0:1:6,14 --> 0:1:6,64
No job,

32
0:1:6,64 --> 0:1:7,86
and you'll end up on the streets.

33
0:1:7,86 --> 0:1:9,48
You can't avoid getting married.

34
0:1:9,48 --> 0:1:11,62
When you're old, no one will take care of you.

35
0:1:11,62 --> 0:1:13,9
If you get married, you'll have someone to look after you when you're old.

36
0:1:13,9 --> 0:1:15,54
With a job, you won't get fired.

37
0:1:15,54 --> 0:1:16,16
Right?

38
0:1:16,16 --> 0:1:17,7
Now, as a parent,

39
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:18,98
you've put down a down payment for your child,

40
0:1:18,98 --> 0:1:21,5
and you think they won't be fired for 30 years?

41
0:1:21,5 --> 0:1:25,14
Do you really think the economy will be that smooth for 30 years?

42
0:1:25,14 --> 0:1:25,6
Right?

43
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:27,1
Once you sign a mortgage, it's a 30-year commitment,

44
0:1:27,1 --> 0:1:28,46
20 years of debt, that's a long time.

45
0:1:28,46 --> 0:1:31,5
That's why children from poor families learn to be responsible early on.

46
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:33,14
Just because the parents are too

47
0:1:33,14 --> 0:1:33,94
Parents

48
0:1:33,94 --> 0:1:37,6
So he is driven by a sense of fear, generation after generation

49
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:38,6
To do certain things

50
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:39,82
But for wealthy families

51
0:1:39,82 --> 0:1:42,18
The most important thing is that parents will have your back

52
0:1:42,18 --> 0:1:44,93
So they allow you to take risks

53
0:1:44,93 --> 0:1:48,47
And actually, there is a difference between the poor and the rich in one aspect

54
0:1:48,47 --> 0:1:49,91
When it comes to entrepreneurship

55
0:1:49,91 --> 0:1:52,2
Some people say, why would the rich even bother to start a business?

56
0:1:52,2 --> 0:1:55,38
Most children of the wealthy, when they're young,

57
0:1:55,38 --> 0:1:57,78
tend to do something on their own,

58
0:1:57,78 --> 0:1:59,8
pursuing what they really want to do.

59
0:1:59,8 --> 0:2:0,3
Then, as they get older,

60
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:1,16
if they're not up to it,

61
0:2:1,16 --> 0:2:2,7
they take over the family business.

62
0:2:2,7 --> 0:2:4,74
Actually, in wealthy families,

63
0:2:4,74 --> 0:2:7,48
they don’t really want their children to build their own careers.

64
0:2:7,48 --> 0:2:8,78
I hope he takes over directly.

65
0:2:8,78 --> 0:2:12,36
But the child may not have the talent or interest for it.

66
0:2:12,36 --> 0:2:14,6
So for most people,

67
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:16,36
fathers don’t necessarily pass their business to their sons,

68
0:2:16,36 --> 0:2:17,6
and often,

69
0:2:17,6 --> 0:2:19,24
sons don’t carry on their fathers’ businesses.

70
0:2:19,24 --> 0:2:21,4
They don’t necessarily follow in the same footsteps.

71
0:2:21,4 --> 0:2:24,69
But typically, they allow you to make a few mistakes.

72
0:2:24,69 --> 0:2:26,41
Speaking of the rich second generation around me,

73
0:2:26,41 --> 0:2:30,34
The success rate of starting your own business is, realistically, about half.

74
0:2:30,34 --> 0:2:32,25
Almost half can succeed.

75
0:2:32,25 --> 0:2:34,17
That means around 40%.

76
0:2:34,17 --> 0:2:35,49
About 42%, to be more precise.

77
0:2:35,49 --> 0:2:38,3
But the majority of the rest don't succeed.

78
0:2:38,3 --> 0:2:39,21
The reason they don't succeed

79
0:2:39,21 --> 0:2:43,43
is that they don't have the right mentality.

80
0:2:43,43 --> 0:2:45,17
In terms of their thinking,

81
0:2:45,17 --> 0:2:46,49
they are more focused on enjoyment.

82
0:2:46,49 --> 0:2:47,69
rather than building a career

83
0:2:47,69 --> 0:2:50,19
he tends to oversimplify things

84
0:2:50,19 --> 0:2:53,339
and the poor are prone to over-simplification as well

85
0:2:53,339 --> 0:2:54,999
he fails to see the dangers

86
0:2:54,999 --> 0:2:58,0
he tends to idealize matters

87
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:0,7
all the poor friends around me who start businesses

88
0:3:0,7 --> 0:3:1,98
without exception

89
0:3:1,98 --> 0:3:3,56
mostly end up opening stores

90
0:3:3,56 --> 0:3:4,6
like bubble tea shops

91
0:3:4,6 --> 0:3:5,52
Opening a coffee shop

92
0:3:5,52 --> 0:3:6,66
Opening a flower shop

93
0:3:6,66 --> 0:3:9,94
We ended up doing the very things we’re worst at

94
0:3:9,94 --> 0:3:11,78
Including getting into the food and beverage industry

95
0:3:11,78 --> 0:3:12,7
I’ve said it countless times

96
0:3:12,7 --> 0:3:13,87
Stay away from the food and beverage industry

97
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:15,95
We don’t have the skills for that

98
0:3:15,95 --> 0:3:17,35
Absolutely don’t do it

99
0:3:17,35 --> 0:3:19,19
But everyone still wants to open a store

100
0:3:19,19 --> 0:3:20,35
For example, he opened a milk tea shop

101
0:3:20,35 --> 0:3:21,38
a beverage store

102
0:3:21,38 --> 0:3:23,72
The children of the wealthy don't follow this pattern at all

103
0:3:23,72 --> 0:3:25,42
When he did it for the first time

104
0:3:25,42 --> 0:3:28,78
he definitely tried it out on a small scale first

105
0:3:28,78 --> 0:3:30,9
I have a wealthy friend

106
0:3:30,9 --> 0:3:33,579
his family is in the wood furniture business

107
0:3:33,579 --> 0:3:36,95
he set up a water purifier himself

108
0:3:36,95 --> 0:3:37,79
for this purpose

109
0:3:37,79 --> 0:3:39,63
Is this a small-scale cost experiment?

110
0:3:39,63 --> 0:3:40,23
No, it's not.

111
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:40,87
I told him

112
0:3:40,87 --> 0:3:43,29
you're not familiar with this thing

113
0:3:43,29 --> 0:3:45,33
and as the company's representative

114
0:3:45,33 --> 0:3:47,13
to be honest

115
0:3:47,13 --> 0:3:50,13
it's a minor requirement

116
0:3:50,13 --> 0:3:52,35
and you're less likely to succeed

117
0:3:52,35 --> 0:3:54,56
Sure enough, it failed after two or three years

118
0:3:54,56 --> 0:3:56,28
Later, he said he wanted to open a store.

119
0:3:56,28 --> 0:3:57,0
I said, 'Oh no.',

120
0:3:57,0 --> 0:3:59,5
This guy is probably going to lose money again.

121
0:3:59,5 --> 0:4:1,16
Then he said before opening the store,

122
0:4:1,16 --> 0:4:3,349
He would try setting up a stall first.

123
0:4:3,349 --> 0:4:5,69
I said, 'Your location is great.',

124
0:4:5,69 --> 0:4:6,249
Because he mentioned setting up a stall,

125
0:4:6,249 --> 0:4:10,18
It can directly test the actual sales in each neighborhood.

126
0:4:10,18 --> 0:4:13,31
To see if the demand is real or not.

127
0:4:13,31 --> 0:4:14,81
If you open a store

128
0:4:14,81 --> 0:4:17,3
let's say a lemonade stand

129
0:4:17,3 --> 0:4:18,47
we're talking about lemon juice

130
0:4:18,47 --> 0:4:19,43
when you sell this product

131
0:4:19,43 --> 0:4:20,89
you start with a small stall

132
0:4:20,89 --> 0:4:23,49
if the stall runs really well

133
0:4:23,49 --> 0:4:26,59
you can expand it into a store

134
0:4:26,59 --> 0:4:28,16
so as I often tell everyone

135
0:4:28,16 --> 0:4:30,9
before you do something, try it on a small scale first

136
0:4:30,9 --> 0:4:32,82
Let's start by becoming a sole trader.

137
0:4:32,82 --> 0:4:34,789
A sole trader first becomes self-employed.

138
0:4:34,789 --> 0:4:36,349
What type of self-employed immigration?

139
0:4:36,349 --> 0:4:38,9
What does it mean to be self-employed?

140
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:38,93
You should first take care of yourself.

141
0:4:38,93 --> 0:4:39,97
Start as a small sole trader.

142
0:4:39,97 --> 0:4:41,9
Start by setting up a stall.

143
0:4:41,9 --> 0:4:42,61
Many people take things out of context.

144
0:4:42,61 --> 0:4:44,27
Saying that you're just asking them to set up stalls.

145
0:4:44,27 --> 0:4:45,78
You're making a graduate student set up a stall

146
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:46,82
They should be preparing for their postgraduate exams

147
0:4:46,82 --> 0:4:47,44
People who are preparing for the civil service exams

148
0:4:47,44 --> 0:4:48,46
You're making them set up a stall

149
0:4:48,46 --> 0:4:49,6
You have ill intentions

150
0:4:49,6 --> 0:4:52,1
You don't need to say anything about him

151
0:4:52,1 --> 0:4:53,32
These people aren't my audience either.

152
0:4:53,32 --> 0:4:54,8
I don't really care

153
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:56,68
It's your choice to take the civil service exam

154
0:4:56,68 --> 0:4:57,8
27%

155
0:4:57,8 --> 0:5:0,1
with a probability of just over 10%

156
0:5:0,1 --> 0:5:1,29
that would be a great honor to the family

157
0:5:1,29 --> 0:5:1,73
right?

158
0:5:1,73 --> 0:5:4,79
getting a salary of 358,000 would be quite nice and satisfying

159
0:5:4,79 --> 0:5:5,19
isn't it?

160
0:5:5,19 --> 0:5:6,75
could you live that kind of life?

161
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:8,23
don't ask me, without you

162
0:5:8,23 --> 0:5:9,31
I'm not your dad

163
0:5:9,31 --> 0:5:11,36
I can't possibly persuade you to live that way

164
0:5:11,36 --> 0:5:13,0
Is it the life I want to live?

165
0:5:13,0 --> 0:5:15,32
And then I lead you down my path

166
0:5:15,32 --> 0:5:17,0
You don’t have to follow in my footsteps

167
0:5:17,0 --> 0:5:17,88
You don't have to listen to me.

168
0:5:17,88 --> 0:5:18,44
No worries

169
0:5:18,44 --> 0:5:20,4
But what are these rules?

170
0:5:20,4 --> 0:5:21,84
Hurun Report mentioned online

171
0:5:21,84 --> 0:5:23,32
Families with assets exceeding 100 million

172
0:5:23,32 --> 0:5:25,0
Not many are professional managers

173
0:5:25,0 --> 0:5:26,82
Most, about 80%, are business owners

174
0:5:26,82 --> 0:5:28,0
The rest are into property speculation

175
0:5:28,0 --> 0:5:29,7
or stock trading

176
0:5:29,7 --> 0:5:30,69
Can you get insider information

177
0:5:30,69 --> 0:5:31,99
for property or stock speculation?

178
0:5:31,99 --> 0:5:32,99
Are you buying a house

179
0:5:32,99 --> 0:5:33,87
You're not into property speculation

180
0:5:33,87 --> 0:5:34,95
Are you trading stocks?

181
0:5:34,95 --> 0:5:37,3
You got played in the stock market

182
0:5:37,169 --> 0:5:39,329
80% of all businesses are run as companies

183
0:5:39,329 --> 0:5:40,189
But some people say

184
0:5:40,189 --> 0:5:42,989
This is the probability of the fittest surviving

185
0:5:42,989 --> 0:5:43,369
Right

186
0:5:43,369 --> 0:5:45,61
But why do business owners stay in the game

187
0:5:45,61 --> 0:5:47,45
It's because starting a business

188
0:5:47,45 --> 0:5:49,19
Whether in China or in America

189
0:5:49,19 --> 0:5:50,79
You'll find it's more about entrepreneurship than stocks

190
0:5:50,79 --> 0:5:54,2
Stocks can at most be like Pelosi,

191
0:5:54,2 --> 0:5:55,16
a few years,

192
0:5:55,16 --> 0:5:58,49
using leverage and all sorts of insider trading to multiply tenfold,

193
0:5:58,49 --> 0:5:59,93
that's the most impressive part,

194
0:5:59,93 --> 0:6:0,63
multiplying tenfold,

195
0:6:0,63 --> 0:6:3,5
if you say you turned 100,000 into 1 million,

196
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:5,84
that's already the most impressive state,

197
0:6:5,84 --> 0:6:8,42
but with startups, your salary and valuation,

198
0:6:8,42 --> 0:6:9,8
can reach tens of billions.

199
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:11,3
It turned around in no time.

200
0:6:11,3 --> 0:6:13,3
Even if you start a small business,

201
0:6:13,3 --> 0:6:14,75
selling tens of millions is quite common.

202
0:6:14,75 --> 0:6:16,11
Starting from zero,

203
0:6:16,11 --> 0:6:17,3
from scratch,

204
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:20,44
Often, it’s not about teaching people how to start a business,

205
0:6:20,44 --> 0:6:22,2
because entrepreneurship can’t really be taught,

206
0:6:22,2 --> 0:6:23,22
it’s just a piece of advice,

207
0:6:23,22 --> 0:6:25,6
and as you fill in the gaps in these areas,

208
0:6:25,6 --> 0:6:28,16
You'll find that many of these startup-related books

209
0:6:28,16 --> 0:6:30,159
are written by Americans.

210
0:6:30,159 --> 0:6:32,599
Americans have written a lot about business.

211
0:6:32,599 --> 0:6:33,959
Including Carnegie's works,

212
0:6:33,959 --> 0:6:35,8
and the Wealth of Nations.

213
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:37,2
Actually, what I recommend to everyone is a kind of American approach.

214
0:6:37,2 --> 0:6:39,28
Now, it has become a widely accepted business philosophy.

215
0:6:39,28 --> 0:6:42,3
Because their society is a hundred percent

216
0:6:42,3 --> 0:6:43,31
a market economy.

217
0:6:43,31 --> 0:6:45,9
We are actually part of a market economy

218
0:6:45,9 --> 0:6:46,41
It's just that in many cases

219
0:6:48,99 --> 0:6:50,47
All these things work this way

220
0:6:50,47 --> 0:6:54,6
This is indeed a component of the economic structure

221
0:6:57,6 --> 0:6:59,24
Private and corporate sectors have started to develop

222
0:6:59,24 --> 0:7:2,69
You need to understand that the development of state-owned enterprises has nothing to do with you

223
0:7:2,69 --> 0:7:3,97
It has nothing to do with you

224
0:7:3,97 --> 0:7:5,9
It's not your personal property

225
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:6,13
It's something enjoyed by the state

226
0:7:6,13 --> 0:7:7,29
It belongs to everyone.

227
0:7:7,29 --> 0:7:8,47
It has nothing to do with you.

228
0:7:8,47 --> 0:7:10,3
If you want to strive personally,

229
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:10,77
want to move up,

230
0:7:10,77 --> 0:7:11,92
you say you want to take the civil service exam,

231
0:7:11,92 --> 0:7:13,0
then take the technical exam.

232
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:14,16
You'll just be a cog in the machine.

233
0:7:14,16 --> 0:7:15,36
Then you'll just be a cog in the machine.

234
0:7:15,36 --> 0:7:16,48
You won't be anything else.

235
0:7:16,48 --> 0:7:18,64
You're here to serve others.

236
0:7:18,64 --> 0:7:21,78
You're not in a position to control everything.

237
0:7:21,78 --> 0:7:23,8
If you want to be free and easy.

238
0:7:23,8 --> 0:7:23,92
If you want to control everything yourself.

239
0:7:23,92 --> 0:7:25,72
Then starting a business is definitely the way to go.

240
0:7:25,72 --> 0:7:27,72
Because you don't have a family business to inherit, right?

241
0:7:27,72 --> 0:7:28,4
Right?

242
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:31,28
That's why the biggest difference between the rich and the poor is...

243
0:7:31,28 --> 0:7:34,52
the issue of testing and learning from small-scale costs.

244
0:7:34,52 --> 0:7:35,48
No matter what

245
0:7:35,48 --> 0:7:38,13
You see many people blindly jump in

246
0:7:38,13 --> 0:7:39,53
Frequently, those who come to me for consultation

247
0:7:39,53 --> 0:7:41,25
Some people are not cut out for entrepreneurship

248
0:7:41,25 --> 0:7:43,78
I would tell them straightforwardly

249
0:7:43,78 --> 0:7:44,94
I have a buddy

250
0:7:44,94 --> 0:7:46,52
A few of us partners

251
0:7:46,52 --> 0:7:47,4
Take on a project

252
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:48,42
I have a channel

253
0:7:48,42 --> 0:7:49,72
Then this thing started making money

254
0:7:49,72 --> 0:7:50,16
Hey buddy

255
0:7:50,16 --> 0:7:50,96
Calm down, calm down

256
0:7:50,96 --> 0:7:52,16
Do you know anything about these things

257
0:7:52,16 --> 0:7:52,64
Corporate law

258
0:7:52,64 --> 0:7:54,4
Do you know about tax laws and such

259
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:54,55
Ah

260
0:7:54,55 --> 0:7:57,59
What kind of liability does a limited liability company have

261
0:7:57,59 --> 0:7:59,7
How are different taxes calculated

262
0:7:59,7 --> 0:7:59,83
Do you know about this?

263
0:7:59,83 --> 0:8:0,75
If you don't know about it,

264
0:8:0,75 --> 0:8:2,22
how do you calculate the cost?

265
0:8:2,22 --> 0:8:3,6
Not calculating the cost,

266
0:8:3,6 --> 0:8:4,54
how do you know how much money you need?

267
0:8:4,54 --> 0:8:5,56
How much funding do you need?

268
0:8:5,56 --> 0:8:7,839
Once you have this money,

269
0:8:7,839 --> 0:8:8,899
how many people do you need to hire?

270
0:8:8,899 --> 0:8:9,819
How long can it sustain you?

271
0:8:9,819 --> 0:8:10,97
You have no idea at all.

272
0:8:10,97 --> 0:8:12,25
You never calculate the costs.

273
0:8:12,25 --> 0:8:14,13
How could you possibly succeed in the end?

274
0:8:14,13 --> 0:8:14,73
It's impossible.

275
0:8:14,73 --> 0:8:15,9
Right?

276
0:8:15,9 --> 0:8:15,65
There's no way you can.

277
0:8:15,65 --> 0:8:16,45
Oh dear.

278
0:8:16,45 --> 0:8:18,33
Our buddy can get things done just like that.

279
0:8:18,33 --> 0:8:19,66
Others can make it work just fine.

280
0:8:19,66 --> 0:8:22,66
That doesn’t sound like something a wealthy person would say.

281
0:8:22,66 --> 0:8:26,68
So when you talk about it, it’s about the things inside you, your inner thoughts.

282
0:8:26,68 --> 0:8:28,98
Once your knowledge and awareness reach a certain level,

283
0:8:28,98 --> 0:8:31,0
you can achieve something, and then you’ll succeed.

284
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:32,88
It’s really about accomplishing something.

285
0:8:32,88 --> 0:8:34,24
It’s about getting one thing done.

286
0:8:38,579 --> 0:8:40,419
If you have a master’s degree or higher education,

287
0:8:40,419 --> 0:8:43,399
you tend to have a very strong need to excel.

288
0:8:43,399 --> 0:8:44,8
You fear failure.

289
0:8:44,8 --> 0:8:46,24
You're afraid of making mistakes

290
0:8:46,24 --> 0:8:48,99
which stops you from taking the first step

291
0:8:48,99 --> 0:8:51,41
Of course, blindly taking the first step isn't right either

292
0:8:51,41 --> 0:8:52,99
but rather those who

293
0:8:52,99 --> 0:8:53,71
at thirteen or fourteen

294
0:8:53,71 --> 0:8:55,35
fifteen or sixteen, start entering the market

295
0:8:55,35 --> 0:8:57,44
Those folks are sharp as a tack

296
0:8:57,44 --> 0:8:59,5
Serial entrepreneurs are usually these people

297
0:8:59,5 --> 0:9:1,62
They're not doing it for the first time

298
0:9:1,62 --> 0:9:3,86
I might have failed at something I did before.

299
0:9:3,86 --> 0:9:5,91
Now it's probably the second or third time.

300
0:9:5,91 --> 0:9:8,63
If you haven't started your first business by the age of 42,

301
0:9:8,63 --> 0:9:10,64
you're unlikely to do it in your lifetime.

302
0:9:10,64 --> 0:9:12,28
So you see, I've been talking a lot,

303
0:9:12,28 --> 0:9:14,78
but I've never actually told you anything specific.

304
0:9:14,78 --> 0:9:16,7
I haven't gone over the steps you should take for starting a business,

305
0:9:16,7 --> 0:9:18,6
nor have I given you any specific advice on that.

306
0:9:18,6 --> 0:9:19,58
I haven't explained how this should be handled either.

307
0:9:19,58 --> 0:9:21,6
Or encourage you to do it

308
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:23,6
Then I'll start a startup boot camp

309
0:9:23,6 --> 0:9:23,79
Never

310
0:9:23,79 --> 0:9:24,63
I'm just telling you

311
0:9:24,63 --> 0:9:27,43
This is something you should do in your lifetime

312
0:9:27,43 --> 0:9:29,19
There's nothing else besides that

313
0:9:29,19 --> 0:9:30,11
Someone told me

314
0:9:30,11 --> 0:9:32,11
The startup mentor said I'm down

315
0:9:32,11 --> 0:9:33,6
Am I down

316
0:9:33,6 --> 0:9:35,1
I poured it right in front of you.

317
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:36,84
I even poured it while looking at your mom's photo.

318
0:9:36,84 --> 0:9:37,8
How did I pour it?

319
0:9:37,8 --> 0:9:38,94
I didn't pour it at all.

320
0:9:38,94 --> 0:9:41,14
I never mentioned this to you.

321
0:9:41,14 --> 0:9:42,92
Starting from 123456, how should we proceed?

322
0:9:42,92 --> 0:9:43,56
Right?

323
0:9:43,56 --> 0:9:45,42
I didn't go through each step with you.

324
0:9:45,42 --> 0:9:46,86
How do we register at the bank?

325
0:9:46,86 --> 0:9:48,8
How do you go to the bank to open a corporate account?

326
0:9:48,8 --> 0:9:50,14
How do you register at the business administration office?

327
0:9:50,14 --> 0:9:50,84
Did I mention that?

328
0:9:50,84 --> 0:9:51,7
What's the tax law like?

329
0:9:51,7 --> 0:9:52,26
Did I mention that?

330
0:9:52,26 --> 0:9:52,93
No.

331
0:9:52,93 --> 0:9:54,57
If you need knowledge in this area,

332
0:9:54,57 --> 0:9:56,45
There are various dedicated UPloaders

333
0:9:56,45 --> 0:9:58,9
I can provide you with experience in this field.

334
0:9:58,9 --> 0:10:0,14
They are UPloaders in the startup zone.

335
0:10:0,14 --> 0:10:2,3
What you truly need is something else

336
0:10:2,3 --> 0:10:3,82
What you truly need is knowledge

337
0:10:3,82 --> 0:10:4,88
a mindset

338
0:10:4,88 --> 0:10:6,79
a way of thinking

339
0:10:6,79 --> 0:10:8,65
more specifically, a pattern of thought

340
0:10:8,65 --> 0:10:11,31
This pattern of thought involves being bold enough to take risks

341
0:10:11,31 --> 0:10:13,7
to experiment and make mistakes on a small scale

342
0:10:13,7 --> 0:10:17,42
The money you receive isn't meant for paying your employees' salaries

343
0:10:17,42 --> 0:10:19,66
This money is given to you personally.

344
0:10:19,66 --> 0:10:23,52
The agency uses it to ensure you can survive.

345
0:10:23,52 --> 0:10:24,94
It’s for buying necessities.

346
0:10:24,94 --> 0:10:27,14
It’s not for the rent of a new company.

347
0:10:27,14 --> 0:10:28,14
Let’s repeat that.

348
0:10:28,14 --> 0:10:30,26
Now, these smaller, more specialized agencies.

349
0:10:30,26 --> 0:10:32,1
You should really read both of these books.

350
0:10:32,1 --> 0:10:34,62
Especially in the AI era now.

351
0:10:34,62 --> 0:10:36,18
In this high-demand environment.

352
0:10:36,18 --> 0:10:39,82
Within the scope of growth that relies on the internet,

353
0:10:39,82 --> 0:10:40,94
when it comes to many things,

354
0:10:40,94 --> 0:10:42,94
the products and services an individual can provide,

355
0:10:42,94 --> 0:10:45,5
can be connected with the majority of people.

356
0:10:45,5 --> 0:10:47,1
So, how should you create something

357
0:10:47,1 --> 0:10:48,37
that everyone needs in terms of services?

358
0:10:48,37 --> 0:10:50,53
Why create a product that everyone needs?

359
0:10:50,53 --> 0:10:51,76
It's that simple.

360
0:10:51,76 --> 0:10:53,36
Actually, it's not about the company structure.

361
0:10:53,36 --> 0:10:54,2
It's not a management issue

362
0:10:54,2 --> 0:10:55,92
It's not about how many people you task.

363
0:10:55,92 --> 0:10:59,1
A lot can be achieved through early outsourcing

364
0:10:59,1 --> 0:11:2,2
Learning and drawing from others' experiences

365
0:11:2,2 --> 0:11:4,33
Actually, a lot of things do require spending money

366
0:11:4,33 --> 0:11:6,1
The areas where you really need to spend money

367
0:11:6,1 --> 0:11:7,41
Look at so many people

368
0:11:7,41 --> 0:11:9,65
I don't even want to comment on these things anymore

369
0:11:9,65 --> 0:11:12,51
Just look at all those who failed in their startups

370
0:11:12,52 --> 0:11:17,59
Without exception, they spent most of their money on renovating new stores.

371
0:11:17,59 --> 0:11:19,45
They all share this trait.

372
0:11:19,45 --> 0:11:20,75
They love buying houses.

373
0:11:20,75 --> 0:11:22,27
And once they buy a house, they renovate it.

374
0:11:22,27 --> 0:11:24,12
Then they rent some kind of store.

375
0:11:24,12 --> 0:11:25,26
Or an office.

376
0:11:25,26 --> 0:11:27,63
And they spend a considerable amount on renovation as well.

377
0:11:27,91 --> 0:11:30,31
This is the behavior I despise the most.

378
0:11:30,31 --> 0:11:32,19
What does renovation really bring anyway?

379
0:11:32,19 --> 0:11:36,3
I'm asking you about the relationship between your renovation costs and your actual revenue.

380
0:11:36,3 --> 0:11:39,49
What does the actual cost of renovation have to do with your revenue?

381
0:11:39,85 --> 0:11:41,65
Can't you live in a simply renovated place?

382
0:11:41,65 --> 0:11:43,59
Can't you buy a second-hand house?

383
0:11:43,59 --> 0:11:45,35
Can't you rent a place that's already furnished?

384
0:11:45,35 --> 0:11:47,96
Why do you have to renovate?

385
0:11:48,16 --> 0:11:49,4
How much money do you have?

386
0:11:49,4 --> 0:11:51,24
Do you really need to renovate your home?

387
0:11:51,24 --> 0:11:51,72
Some people say

388
0:11:51,72 --> 0:11:53,6
Look at Rong Zhen's house; the decoration isn't great.

389
0:11:53,6 --> 0:11:56,62
Why should I spend so much money on decoration?

390
0:11:56,62 --> 0:11:57,74
Can't he live there?

391
0:11:57,74 --> 0:11:58,7
Is it polluted?

392
0:11:59,7 --> 0:12:2,79
Do I have guests over every day?

393
0:12:2,79 --> 0:12:3,59
I insist on decorating.

394
0:12:3,59 --> 0:12:3,999
I insist on decorating.

395
0:12:3,999 --> 0:12:6,639
This decoration has to have a focal point.

396
0:12:6,639 --> 0:12:9,62
Are you telling me you do interior design?'

397
0:12:9,62 --> 0:12:10,98
Why is it necessary to renovate?

398
0:12:10,98 --> 0:12:12,54
Look, you don't have this issue.

399
0:12:12,54 --> 0:12:14,68
What's the core issue here?

400
0:12:14,68 --> 0:12:16,14
If I open a store,

401
0:12:16,14 --> 0:12:17,64
I need to renovate first.

402
0:12:17,64 --> 0:12:19,6
If you're opening a billiard hall,

403
0:12:19,6 --> 0:12:20,74
if it's an internet cafe,

404
0:12:20,74 --> 0:12:22,44
or a nightclub,

405
0:12:22,44 --> 0:12:23,76
or a massage parlor.

406
0:12:23,76 --> 0:12:25,32
A large massage parlor

407
0:12:25,32 --> 0:12:27,66
or something like a spa or water therapy

408
0:12:27,66 --> 0:12:29,0
a one-stop shop for eating and drinking

409
0:12:29,0 --> 0:12:30,14
you should pretend a bit

410
0:12:30,14 --> 0:12:31,82
Northerners care a lot about face

411
0:12:31,82 --> 0:12:33,46
face is really important

412
0:12:33,46 --> 0:12:34,94
but in most cases

413
0:12:34,94 --> 0:12:37,34
your office is a mess, like a pigsty

414
0:12:37,34 --> 0:12:38,6
why would you want to renovate it

415
0:12:38,6 --> 0:12:40,54
Why do you insist on renovating?

416
0:12:40,54 --> 0:12:41,78
Have you ever thought about this?

417
0:12:41,78 --> 0:12:42,94
It's about your mentality.

418
0:12:42,94 --> 0:12:45,68
Why do you feel the need to renovate in your mind?

419
0:12:45,68 --> 0:12:47,2
Haven't you considered this?

420
0:12:47,2 --> 0:12:47,9
For the sake of appearances.

421
0:12:47,9 --> 0:12:49,12
Your place is always hosting guests.

422
0:12:49,12 --> 0:12:50,76
Are you the one hosting guests or is it your mom?

423
0:12:50,76 --> 0:12:51,96
Have you thought about this?

424
0:12:51,96 --> 0:12:54,21
Why is it that your home must welcome guests?

425
0:12:54,21 --> 0:12:56,19
Many people still keep a guest room in their homes.

426
0:12:56,19 --> 0:12:57,89
Is anyone actually living there?

427
0:12:58,89 --> 0:13:1,83
Have you ever thought about why, when you start a new company,

428
0:13:1,83 --> 0:13:4,93
the most crucial costs are spent on the decoration?

429
0:13:4,93 --> 0:13:6,75
Even if it's a rented place,

430
0:13:6,75 --> 0:13:8,23
There are also many UPloaders who are

431
0:13:8,23 --> 0:13:9,43
I'll start with a small villa,

432
0:13:9,43 --> 0:13:10,71
I'll get it renovated first.

433
0:13:10,71 --> 0:13:11,39
Let's start by spending a year

434
0:13:11,39 --> 0:13:12,7
or two years

435
0:13:12,7 --> 0:13:13,86
investing a few million

436
0:13:13,86 --> 0:13:14,34
Oh

437
0:13:14,34 --> 0:13:15,98
You make money so easily

438
0:13:15,98 --> 0:13:18,2
You're just like Brother Daxiang

439
0:13:18,2 --> 0:13:20,16
It's not easy to earn some money

440
0:13:20,16 --> 0:13:21,56
To make a large sum of money all at once

441
0:13:21,56 --> 0:13:24,48
and then spend 1.2 million on a 1.19 million car

442
0:13:24,48 --> 0:13:26,56
You're really acting like a small-minded person who got a bit of wealth and is showing off.

443
0:13:26,56 --> 0:13:28,12
Why do you have to renovate?

444
0:13:28,12 --> 0:13:29,72
What's the purpose of your renovation?

445
0:13:29,72 --> 0:13:33,83
I don't mean to oppose any UPloader who adds decoration or renovation content.

446
0:13:33,83 --> 0:13:37,18
Many people, when making their VLOGs, do things like this:

447
0:13:37,18 --> 0:13:38,98
I set up a room or something like that.

448
0:13:38,98 --> 0:13:40,38
I transformed it into something I really like.

449
0:13:40,38 --> 0:13:42,14
I turned it into a cozy little courtyard that I love.

450
0:13:42,14 --> 0:13:42,74
I did this and that.

451
0:13:42,74 --> 0:13:43,3
How much did it cost?

452
0:13:43,3 --> 0:13:44,79
This little courtyard is so cozy.

453
0:13:45,28 --> 0:13:47,94
But when you're broke,

454
0:13:47,94 --> 0:13:52,18
why don’t you buy the Xiaomi Su 7 Extra Ultra?

455
0:13:52,18 --> 0:13:55,57
What’s the point of your renovation?

456
0:13:55,57 --> 0:13:58,5
Do you know that renovation isn’t about having a million dollars

457
0:13:58,5 --> 0:13:59,61
and spending just three or five thousand to fix it up?

458
0:13:59,61 --> 0:14:1,96
Renovation means if you have a million dollars, you spend three or fifty thousand,

459
0:14:1,96 --> 0:14:2,96
or seven or eighty thousand.

460
0:14:2,96 --> 0:14:4,64
If it's a villa you're renovating

461
0:14:4,64 --> 0:14:6,48
A problem that over a million can't solve

462
0:14:6,48 --> 0:14:10,58
Do you have any revenue that can help you come up with a million?

463
0:14:10,58 --> 0:14:11,36
Two million?

464
0:14:11,36 --> 0:14:12,3
In a year?

465
0:14:12,3 --> 0:14:14,72
Are you the one who made ten million that year?

466
0:14:14,72 --> 0:14:16,589
You're spending a million on renovation right now

467
0:14:16,589 --> 0:14:19,249
This kind of luxurious and competitive spending

468
0:14:19,249 --> 0:14:22,6
Is the most crucial reason for your business failure

469
0:14:22,6 --> 0:14:25,4
How much can you eat, anyway?

470
0:14:25,4 --> 0:14:25,84
Let me tell you.

471
0:14:25,84 --> 0:14:27,48
The most common reason for startup failure is low profit margin.

472
0:14:27,48 --> 0:14:29,72
One reason is having too many employees.

473
0:14:29,72 --> 0:14:31,88
Another is choosing a location that's too large.

474
0:14:31,88 --> 0:14:33,8
Spending too much on renovations is also a big issue.

475
0:14:33,8 --> 0:14:34,64
These are the main two reasons.

476
0:14:34,64 --> 0:14:36,6
It's tough being a solo entrepreneur.

477
0:14:36,6 --> 0:14:37,12
Being the only boss.

478
0:14:37,12 --> 0:14:38,32
Where did you register your company?

479
0:14:38,32 --> 0:14:40,829
Has the business administration forced you to hire employees?

480
0:14:40,829 --> 0:14:42,749
Can you hire temporary workers?

481
0:14:42,749 --> 0:14:44,269
Can you use interns?

482
0:14:44,269 --> 0:14:47,0
Can you get friends or family to help for free?

483
0:14:47,0 --> 0:14:48,84
Can you hire fewer people?

484
0:14:48,84 --> 0:14:50,16
Just hire one or two people?

485
0:14:50,16 --> 0:14:51,48
Can it work this way?

486
0:14:51,48 --> 0:14:52,26
Tell me.

487
0:14:52,26 --> 0:14:52,86
Tell me

488
0:14:52,86 --> 0:14:53,36
Why

489
0:14:53,36 --> 0:14:53,82
Why

490
0:14:53,82 --> 0:14:54,46
Baby, why

491
0:14:54,46 --> 0:14:57,46
Is it often like this when you answer me?

492
0:14:57,46 --> 0:14:59,56
So why do you have to renovate?

493
0:14:59,56 --> 0:15:1,3
I can understand you renovating the store

494
0:15:1,3 --> 0:15:3,119
But why do you want to renovate the office?

495
0:15:3,119 --> 0:15:4,359
Many people don’t get it

496
0:15:4,359 --> 0:15:6,879
Is he into home renovation or something?

497
0:15:6,879 --> 0:15:9,97
This UPloader has a particular fondness for home renovation.

498
0:15:9,97 --> 0:15:12,7
Is home renovation something a poor person should do?

499
0:15:12,7 --> 0:15:13,82
You are a poor person.

500
0:15:13,82 --> 0:15:14,9
You have to admit that.

501
0:15:14,9 --> 0:15:16,84
Otherwise, why would you be working so hard?

502
0:15:16,84 --> 0:15:18,74
But when your business isn’t taking off,

503
0:15:18,74 --> 0:15:21,19
Why would you spend money on decoration first?

504
0:15:21,19 --> 0:15:22,87
I’ve been complaining about the renovation for so long.

505
0:15:22,87 --> 0:15:24,21
But I really don't understand

506
0:15:24,21 --> 0:15:25,95
all those who failed in their startups

507
0:15:25,95 --> 0:15:29,12
without exception, they spent tens of thousands on renovations

508
0:15:29,12 --> 0:15:31,48
after spending tens of thousands on this store, it still didn’t work out

509
0:15:31,48 --> 0:15:32,36
the fire department said it wasn’t up to code

510
0:15:32,36 --> 0:15:32,98
so they had to make adjustments

511
0:15:32,98 --> 0:15:34,24
and then spent another tens of thousands

512
0:15:34,24 --> 0:15:35,8
and then the startup failed again

513
0:15:35,8 --> 0:15:37,36
isn’t that you?

514
0:15:37,36 --> 0:15:38,76
Is it the environment that's the problem?

515
0:15:38,76 --> 0:15:40,56
This is clearly your fault, isn't it?

516
0:15:40,56 --> 0:15:42,96
Your little, poor, tiny brain

517
0:15:42,96 --> 0:15:46,79
is filled with too much useless knowledge.

518
0:15:46,79 --> 0:15:48,239
What does interior design have to do with entrepreneurship?

519
0:15:48,239 --> 0:15:49,999
Real entrepreneurship is something you can start in a garage,

520
0:15:49,999 --> 0:15:50,879
in a basement,

521
0:15:50,879 --> 0:15:53,38
or even in a rural house.

522
0:15:53,38 --> 0:15:54,94
It's about setting up your framework.

523
0:15:54,94 --> 0:15:56,46
Get your circular economy going

524
0:15:56,46 --> 0:15:58,16
instead of just renovating

525
0:15:58,16 --> 0:15:59,48
So let me tell you

526
0:15:59,48 --> 0:16:0,8
for the poor

527
0:16:0,8 --> 0:16:2,579
I haven't complained about renovation before

528
0:16:2,579 --> 0:16:3,619
but to be honest

529
0:16:7,159 --> 0:16:10,429
most of it is about keeping up appearances

530
0:16:10,429 --> 0:16:12,3
so he buys a car

531
0:16:12,3 --> 0:16:15,31
after buying a house, how can it just be about the house?

532
0:16:15,31 --> 0:16:16,39
I actually didn't say that

533
0:16:16,39 --> 0:16:17,71
I didn't mention that point

534
0:16:17,71 --> 0:16:18,95
Many people buy a house and

535
0:16:18,95 --> 0:16:21,43
it's not just about buying a house

536
0:16:21,71 --> 0:16:23,59
the car cost over 100,000

537
0:16:23,59 --> 0:16:25,59
like a G-Class or something

538
0:16:25,59 --> 0:16:28,7
and I plan to get a better car in the future

539
0:16:28,7 --> 0:16:28,95
a better car

540
0:16:28,95 --> 0:16:30,96
spending over a million on the street

541
0:16:30,96 --> 0:16:32,56
You have over a million on the street

542
0:16:32,56 --> 0:16:33,76
Then in a couple of days, it depreciates

543
0:16:33,76 --> 0:16:34,48
It drops to a few hundred thousand

544
0:16:34,48 --> 0:16:36,2
It becomes a few tens of thousands, right?

545
0:16:36,2 --> 0:16:36,66
Is that how it works?

546
0:16:36,66 --> 0:16:38,4
Then the car dealers are happy

547
0:16:38,4 --> 0:16:40,87
The used car dealers are buying your car, right?

548
0:16:40,87 --> 0:16:43,95
And the second-hand coffee machine dealers are buying your coffee machine, right?

549
0:16:43,95 --> 0:16:45,91
They specialize in official stores

550
0:16:45,91 --> 0:16:48,25
That's the full-service funeral arrangement, right?

551
0:16:48,25 --> 0:16:49,63
This renovation must have cost you a pretty penny, didn't it?

552
0:16:49,63 --> 0:16:50,79
Next time, open a different kind of store.

553
0:16:50,79 --> 0:16:52,77
They would have to redo the renovation, wouldn't they?

554
0:16:52,77 --> 0:16:55,63
Isn't all your money going to the renovators?

555
0:16:55,63 --> 0:16:58,5
Hmm, why do you need to renovate anyway?

556
0:16:58,5 --> 0:16:58,85
Have you thought about it?

557
0:16:58,85 --> 0:17:0,41
So, the difference between the poor and the rich is often that

558
0:17:0,41 --> 0:17:2,55
Many times, the poor start by opening a store.

559
0:17:2,55 --> 0:17:4,2
The wealthy start by setting up stalls

560
0:17:4,2 --> 0:17:5,52
It's really just like that

561
0:17:5,52 --> 0:17:7,62
Because you get familiar with these processes

562
0:17:7,62 --> 0:17:10,34
Often, you'll find that many things aren't necessary

563
0:17:10,34 --> 0:17:12,3
You don't need so many employees

564
0:17:12,3 --> 0:17:14,74
You don't need such a large office space

565
0:17:14,74 --> 0:17:16,5
With the shared workspace

566
0:17:16,5 --> 0:17:20,17
You don't need so many people dressed in formal suits

567
0:17:20,17 --> 0:17:22,25
And the coffee machine is set up, among other things

568
0:17:22,25 --> 0:17:24,719
These things have nothing to do with your company's profitability.

569
0:17:24,999 --> 0:17:27,379
Your company can operate entirely from home.

570
0:17:27,379 --> 0:17:28,259
No problem.

571
0:17:28,259 --> 0:17:29,799
Tasks can be coordinated through the internet.

572
0:17:29,799 --> 0:17:31,72
As a result, you don't have to hire employees.

573
0:17:31,72 --> 0:17:33,92
Then let AI handle everything.

574
0:17:33,92 --> 0:17:35,56
Hire fewer people.

575
0:17:35,56 --> 0:17:36,54
Rent less space.

576
0:17:36,54 --> 0:17:37,24
Do less renovation.

577
0:17:37,24 --> 0:17:39,72
This is the best advice for starting a business.

578
0:17:39,72 --> 0:17:40,28
Let me tell you.

579
0:17:40,28 --> 0:17:42,22
Many people fail and don't even know where they went wrong.

580
0:17:42,22 --> 0:17:43,64
It's not in those areas.

581
0:17:43,64 --> 0:17:45,66
There are real questions about management.

582
0:17:45,66 --> 0:17:46,22
What kind of issues?

583
0:17:46,22 --> 0:17:47,42
After opening the store, they might only make three to five thousand.

584
0:17:47,42 --> 0:17:48,909
They can only earn three to five thousand.

585
0:17:48,909 --> 0:17:50,229
If you're doing it alone

586
0:17:50,229 --> 0:17:51,549
That three to five thousand should be enough for you to live on.

587
0:17:51,549 --> 0:17:54,549
When they first started the shop, they might have only made ten or twenty thousand.

588
0:17:54,549 --> 0:17:55,669
You might not be able to work from home.

589
0:17:55,669 --> 0:17:56,469
If you can work from home,

590
0:17:56,469 --> 0:17:57,25
work from home,

591
0:17:57,25 --> 0:17:59,29
if it really doesn’t work out, then you’ll have to produce something.

592
0:17:59,29 --> 0:17:59,93
if you can do it yourself,

593
0:17:59,93 --> 0:18:0,69
if you can have AI do it,

594
0:18:0,69 --> 0:18:2,3
don’t hire employees to do it.

595
0:18:2,3 --> 0:18:2,83
That's how simple it is.

596
0:18:2,83 --> 0:18:4,33
You just hired an operator.

597
0:18:4,33 --> 0:18:5,889
The amount of money the employees earn

598
0:18:5,889 --> 0:18:9,649
is not commensurate with the service provided by the products they offer.

599
0:18:9,649 --> 0:18:11,269
Many things are like this.

600
0:18:11,269 --> 0:18:14,26
And a lot of things don't require you to renovate your store.

601
0:18:14,26 --> 0:18:15,96
So you see, what I'm telling you is

602
0:18:15,96 --> 0:18:17,9
the only advice I can give you is 238.

603
0:18:17,9 --> 0:18:20,34
In the video, if you're doing blind massage,

604
0:18:20,34 --> 0:18:21,66
you don't need to renovate the store either.

605
0:18:21,66 --> 0:18:23,22
Just paint the walls.

606
0:18:23,22 --> 0:18:24,78
Just lay some flooring tiles.

607
0:18:24,78 --> 0:18:26,73
No need to overdo the renovation.

608
0:18:26,73 --> 0:18:28,5
Or make it overly fancy.

609
0:18:28,5 --> 0:18:29,21
It will cost you a lot of money.

610
0:18:29,21 --> 0:18:30,29
And you haven't even started making money yet.

611
0:18:30,29 --> 0:18:32,1
Why spend money first?

612
0:18:32,1 --> 0:18:33,41
This is the problem of the poor

613
0:18:33,41 --> 0:18:34,17
They haven't earned any money yet,

614
0:18:34,17 --> 0:18:34,81
but they want to spend money first.

615
0:18:34,81 --> 0:18:35,59
Once they get funding,

616
0:18:35,59 --> 0:18:37,5
or borrow money,

617
0:18:37,5 --> 0:18:37,69
or take out a loan,

618
0:18:37,69 --> 0:18:39,15
they think, 'Oh, I have money now,'

619
0:18:39,15 --> 0:18:40,49
I'm a rich person now.

620
0:18:40,49 --> 0:18:42,15
I have a million in my account.

621
0:18:42,15 --> 0:18:43,59
I'll spend 300,000 on renovation.

622
0:18:44,51 --> 0:18:45,77
So let me tell you,

623
0:18:45,77 --> 0:18:47,57
the point of failure in entrepreneurship

624
0:18:47,57 --> 0:18:50,69
is not necessarily that you failed in management or anything like that.

625
0:18:50,69 --> 0:18:52,49
A lot of it is due to wasteful spending.

626
0:18:52,49 --> 0:18:53,48
That's how it happens.

627
0:18:53,48 --> 0:18:54,2
So let me explain,

628
0:18:54,2 --> 0:18:56,32
the difference between the rich and the poor is significant.

629
0:18:56,32 --> 0:18:58,88
Rich people are very, very careful with their spending,

630
0:18:58,88 --> 0:19:0,58
very, very frugal.

631
0:19:0,58 --> 0:19:2,86
So at the beginning, they only set up a stall,

632
0:19:2,86 --> 0:19:5,71
only do very simple small things.

633
0:19:5,71 --> 0:19:9,3
It's the poor who will spend a lot of money on

634
0:19:9,3 --> 0:19:10,47
useless things.

635
0:19:10,47 --> 0:19:12,27
Buy a new set of clothes first,

636
0:19:12,27 --> 0:19:13,32
renovate first,

637
0:19:13,32 --> 0:19:15,62
buy a car for show first,

638
0:19:15,62 --> 0:19:16,94
have to have the appearance,

639
0:19:16,94 --> 0:19:17,56
without the substance,

640
0:19:17,56 --> 0:19:18,56
nothing at all.

641
0:19:18,56 --> 0:19:20,4
This is the biggest difference between the poor and the rich,

642
0:19:20,4 --> 0:19:21,46
the difference in mindset,

643
0:19:21,46 --> 0:19:23,78
the difference in spending speed.

644
0:19:23,78 --> 0:19:25,9
Poor people are very willing to spend money,

645
0:19:25,9 --> 0:19:27,1
but rich people aren't rich people

646
0:19:27,1 --> 0:19:28,79
who save every penny.

647
0:19:28,79 --> 0:19:31,3
Of course, there are some expenses that shouldn't be saved,

648
0:19:31,3 --> 0:19:34,13
they won't save or impact production and income.

649
0:19:34,13 --> 0:19:35,31
If it should be saved,

650
0:19:35,31 --> 0:19:36,57
they won't save it.

651
0:19:36,57 --> 0:19:37,99
But not for the poor,

652
0:19:37,99 --> 0:19:40,79
who will spend several times more for the sake of appearances.

653
0:19:40,79 --> 0:19:42,99
That's why they fail.

654
0:19:42,99 --> 0:19:45,63
Because they think starting a business is a matter of having face,

655
0:19:45,63 --> 0:19:46,27
fail once,

656
0:19:46,27 --> 0:19:47,41
and then retreat again,

657
0:19:47,41 --> 0:19:48,8
get through it,

658
0:19:48,8 --> 0:19:50,0
rely on parents to cover the losses,

659
0:19:50,0 --> 0:19:51,38
This is the case for most people,

660
0:19:51,38 --> 0:19:53,32
especially in the Beijing area,

661
0:19:53,32 --> 0:19:55,76
the actual situation of entrepreneurs.

662
0:19:55,76 --> 0:19:57,6
Learn from these lessons,

663
0:19:58,76 --> 0:20:0,6
it's never too late to mend.
