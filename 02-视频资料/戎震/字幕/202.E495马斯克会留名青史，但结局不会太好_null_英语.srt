1
0:0:1,46 --> 0:0:2,34
Hey everyone!

2
0:0:2,34 --> 0:0:5,99
The scenes in my recent videos have all been shot with my phone.

3
0:0:5,99 --> 0:0:8,27
But the audio quality is a bit lacking.

4
0:0:8,27 --> 0:0:12,21
But for this place, editing and uploading are both quite convenient.

5
0:0:12,21 --> 0:0:15,1
For this episode, I decided to break from my usual routine.

6
0:0:15,1 --> 0:0:17,12
I want to talk about Elon Musk.

7
0:0:17,12 --> 0:0:19,44
I'll keep it relatively short.

8
0:0:19,44 --> 0:0:21,3
To help improve the completion rate for viewers.

9
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:21,96
That's the plan.

10
0:0:21,96 --> 0:0:26,32
I think Marxke's reforms may not necessarily succeed.

11
0:0:26,32 --> 0:0:28,4
They might fail midway.

12
0:0:28,4 --> 0:0:31,63
There could be a significant issue.

13
0:0:31,63 --> 0:0:34,15
Such as a potential threat to personal safety.

14
0:0:34,15 --> 0:0:35,47
This is my personal judgment

15
0:0:35,47 --> 0:0:39,54
But it's not necessarily about personal safety; it might reach a point where

16
0:0:39,54 --> 0:0:40,9
sacrificing a pawn to save the game becomes necessary.

17
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:43,8
Stepping down to a secondary role,

18
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:44,1
or even resigning altogether.

19
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:45,78
And then moving overseas

20
0:0:45,78 --> 0:0:47,29
It's all possible

21
0:0:47,29 --> 0:0:49,33
From a historical perspective

22
0:0:49,33 --> 0:0:51,59
Such measures to reduce the power of feudal lords

23
0:0:51,59 --> 0:0:54,14
Reforms by Shang Yang

24
0:0:54,14 --> 0:0:55,1
Wang Anshi

25
0:0:55,1 --> 0:0:56,3
Chao Cuo

26
0:0:56,3 --> 0:0:59,78
Zhang Juzheng, their outcomes weren't particularly good

27
0:0:59,78 --> 0:1:3,38
Now, as you know, Jia Xu is very popular

28
0:1:3,38 --> 0:1:5,26
I am in sync with Jia Xu's heart.

29
0:1:5,26 --> 0:1:7,66
Jia Xu's principle in life

30
0:1:7,66 --> 0:1:9,759
is to deceive and harm others.

31
0:1:9,759 --> 0:1:11,239
He harms the nobles,

32
0:1:11,239 --> 0:1:14,27
but he also aligns himself with them.

33
0:1:14,27 --> 0:1:16,61
After he exhausts the nobles,

34
0:1:16,61 --> 0:1:18,19
it is actually the people who benefit.

35
0:1:18,19 --> 0:1:19,79
But no matter which noble family,

36
0:1:19,79 --> 0:1:23,43
he doesn’t hesitate to lead Li Jue and Guo Si to kill the nobles in Chang'an.

37
0:1:23,43 --> 0:1:25,79
Still, he uses Zhang Xiu to kill Cao Cao

38
0:1:25,79 --> 0:1:27,85
or uses Cao Cao to eliminate others

39
0:1:27,85 --> 0:1:29,89
in reality, it’s all about reducing the number of nobles

40
0:1:29,89 --> 0:1:32,14
because he understands that as the number of nobles decreases

41
0:1:32,14 --> 0:1:33,7
the safety of the people is secured

42
0:1:33,7 --> 0:1:34,82
just like in Game of Thrones

43
0:1:34,82 --> 0:1:35,9
it’s because there are too many nobles

44
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:39,0
that so many people are recruited to fight wars

45
0:1:39,0 --> 0:1:41,16
so he sticks to this principle

46
0:1:41,16 --> 0:1:44,2
But if your reform approach is from the bottom up,

47
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:46,12
you stand on the side of the people,

48
0:1:46,12 --> 0:1:47,66
you will be remembered in history,

49
0:1:47,66 --> 0:1:49,59
but you will certainly not meet a good end,

50
0:1:50,35 --> 0:1:52,7
ending up like Yu Qian,

51
0:1:52,7 --> 0:1:52,63
facing the same fate,

52
0:1:52,63 --> 0:1:53,91
that’s you,

53
0:1:53,91 --> 0:1:56,27
because the people, when they rise up to kill, lack the power,

54
0:1:58,27 --> 0:2:0,47
those people in those countries

55
0:2:0,47 --> 0:2:1,31
The power is diluted

56
0:2:1,31 --> 0:2:2,31
suppressed at the grassroots level

57
0:2:2,31 --> 0:2:4,35
he lacks substantial support

58
0:2:4,35 --> 0:2:7,81
and the political struggles among the nobility have been going on since ancient times

59
0:2:7,81 --> 0:2:8,63
when you attempt reforms

60
0:2:8,63 --> 0:2:9,31
or initiatives like these

61
0:2:9,31 --> 0:2:11,7
you're essentially infringing on the nobles' interests

62
0:2:11,7 --> 0:2:13,65
whether it's the pharmaceutical conglomerate

63
0:2:13,65 --> 0:2:16,93
the Silicon Valley group, or the military-industrial complex

64
0:2:16,93 --> 0:2:18,17
How do you say these?

65
0:2:18,17 --> 0:2:19,31
These financial conglomerates

66
0:2:19,31 --> 0:2:21,35
In the U.S., they are a few major ones

67
0:2:21,35 --> 0:2:24,26
These people, they just keep doing the same old thing

68
0:2:24,26 --> 0:2:26,3
I rarely do it on a regular basis

69
0:2:26,3 --> 0:2:28,43
Now I seldom produce content about the U.S.

70
0:2:28,43 --> 0:2:31,15
It's because, as you all know, my viewpoint is

71
0:2:31,15 --> 0:2:33,45
Both China and the U.S. are great nations

72
0:2:33,45 --> 0:2:35,49
I usually don't comment on America's domestic affairs

73
0:2:35,49 --> 0:2:38,41
But this time, I really feel it's a pity for this person.

74
0:2:38,41 --> 0:2:40,21
Because relying on the people to push for reform

75
0:2:40,21 --> 0:2:42,769
usually ends up being very tragic.

76
0:2:45,569 --> 0:2:47,32
He would end up very tragically as well.

77
0:2:47,32 --> 0:2:48,8
Trump used him to say

78
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:50,4
at a critical moment, he wore a glove.

79
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:51,84
You could discard this glove.

80
0:2:51,84 --> 0:2:53,6
Or spread rumors of discord between the two or something.

81
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:56,25
This issue can ultimately be smoothed over.

82
0:2:56,25 --> 0:2:59,25
But people like royal envoys or such

83
0:2:59,25 --> 0:3:1,43
This one wearing the yellow jacket

84
0:3:1,43 --> 0:3:2,77
bearing the imperial sword

85
0:3:2,77 --> 0:3:5,61
usually don't end up with a particularly good outcome

86
0:3:5,61 --> 0:3:8,13
because if he doesn't leave the United States after four years

87
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:9,25
the outcome might not be particularly good

88
0:3:9,25 --> 0:3:12,58
because he is an entrepreneur with a pure heart

89
0:3:12,58 --> 0:3:14,64
who really works with incredible efficiency

90
0:3:18,19 --> 0:3:19,81
and has offended the clan groups

91
0:3:19,81 --> 0:3:21,51
He offended the aristocratic group

92
0:3:21,51 --> 0:3:22,55
He has an interest group

93
0:3:22,55 --> 0:3:24,33
an interest group, to put it that way

94
0:3:24,33 --> 0:3:26,49
which makes the ultimate issue hard to resolve

95
0:3:26,49 --> 0:3:27,57
Because historically speaking

96
0:3:27,57 --> 0:3:32,55
remember, you can only rely on one faction of the nobility to suppress

97
0:3:32,55 --> 0:3:34,57
the other faction of the nobility

98
0:3:34,57 --> 0:3:37,23
You can't rely on the New Aristocracy to eliminate the aristocrats.

99
0:3:37,23 --> 0:3:41,37
and rely on nobles from different regions to gain the upper hand

100
0:3:41,37 --> 0:3:44,81
But you can't completely rely on Vero, can you?

101
0:3:44,81 --> 0:3:47,73
Then lay off 97% of the department?

102
0:3:47,73 --> 0:3:51,3
You have to understand, these people are not just their positions,

103
0:3:51,3 --> 0:3:53,68
but they have disciples and former colleagues all over the place.

104
0:3:53,68 --> 0:3:56,0
They form a vast network of connections.

105
0:3:56,0 --> 0:3:57,32
Close relatives and close friends,

106
0:3:57,32 --> 0:3:59,0
so these interest groups are not something to be easily tampered with.

107
0:3:59,0 --> 0:4:0,84
They are not usually very easy to move around.

108
0:4:0,84 --> 0:4:2,959
Unless you can break them down into several pieces.

109
0:4:2,959 --> 0:4:4,699
There's something new to replace him

110
0:4:4,699 --> 0:4:5,719
To sum it up

111
0:4:5,719 --> 0:4:7,319
Just like Caesar in Rome

112
0:4:7,319 --> 0:4:11,3
He ultimately died from the daggers of many, including Brutus

113
0:4:11,3 --> 0:4:13,55
He might end up with the same fate

114
0:4:13,55 --> 0:4:14,83
So, in this context

115
0:4:14,83 --> 0:4:16,9
A reform that burns all bridges

116
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:19,299
Usually turns out to be incomplete

117
0:4:19,299 --> 0:4:21,999
And it relies on administrative measures

118
0:4:21,999 --> 0:4:24,57
He wasn't about a bottom-up transformation of the class system

119
0:4:24,57 --> 0:4:26,69
a thorough revolution that would change the relationships completely

120
0:4:26,69 --> 0:4:30,23
In practice, the results would be hard to sustain

121
0:4:30,23 --> 0:4:32,85
Moreover, his personal safety would be at risk

122
0:4:32,85 --> 0:4:35,48
And at the same time, he would make too many enemies

123
0:4:35,48 --> 0:4:37,42
That's usually not a good thing

124
0:4:37,42 --> 0:4:39,18
Looking at Chinese history

125
0:4:39,18 --> 0:4:41,48
Those who understood how to manage the aristocratic groups

126
0:4:41,48 --> 0:4:45,31
Could all become emperors and achieve great things

127
0:4:45,31 --> 0:4:46,49
Could all successfully usurp the throne

128
0:4:46,49 --> 0:4:49,36
But those who never took the aristocratic groups seriously

129
0:4:49,36 --> 0:4:51,64
And only cared about the interests of the common people

130
0:4:51,64 --> 0:4:53,44
Usually ended up as tragic heroes

131
0:4:55,38 --> 0:4:58,4
We really shouldn't follow in Musk's footsteps

132
0:4:58,4 --> 0:4:59,68
From an idealistic standpoint

133
0:4:59,68 --> 0:5:2,0
I think it might make one famous in history

134
0:5:2,0 --> 0:5:3,68
But it also makes one very likely to meet a bad end
