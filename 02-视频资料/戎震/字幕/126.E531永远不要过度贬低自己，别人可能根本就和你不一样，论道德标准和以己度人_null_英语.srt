0:0:0,44 --> 0:0:1,72
Hey, welcome to another episode of our chat

2
0:0:1,72 --> 0:0:2,88
Today, we're going to talk about

3
0:0:2,88 --> 0:0:6,2
how often we underestimate ourselves

4
0:0:6,2 --> 0:0:10,11
We tend to think that in many aspects

5
0:0:10,11 --> 0:0:11,77
what we do is just like everyone else’s

6
0:0:11,77 --> 0:0:13,41
but in reality, it’s quite different

7
0:0:13,41 --> 0:0:16,27
Many times, our own qualities are actually quite strong

8
0:0:16,27 --> 0:0:17,45
but we just don’t realize it

9
0:0:17,45 --> 0:0:20,31
For example, recently, Dong has been delivering food

10
0:0:20,31 --> 0:0:21,83
I watched Dong Ge deliver food.

11
0:0:21,83 --> 0:0:23,31
That's when I realized many people

12
0:0:23,31 --> 0:0:25,7
basically just leave the food at the door on the ground.

13
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:26,74
This is actually pretty good.

14
0:0:26,74 --> 0:0:27,62
For more people,

15
0:0:27,62 --> 0:0:30,49
they might see the delivery person only when they step out.

16
0:0:30,49 --> 0:0:31,95
reaching out their hand quite far,

17
0:0:31,95 --> 0:0:33,19
grabbing the food once they get it,

18
0:0:33,19 --> 0:0:34,71
and then quickly pulling back.

19
0:0:34,71 --> 0:0:37,8
Actually, I think this way of doing things

20
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:38,44
In broad daylight

21
0:0:38,44 --> 0:0:40,5
How should I put it, you become

22
0:0:40,5 --> 0:0:41,46
A grown man

23
0:0:41,46 --> 0:0:43,94
You don’t need to be afraid of another grown man

24
0:0:43,94 --> 0:0:46,28
I feel many people might, how to say it

25
0:0:46,28 --> 0:0:47,92
Out of social anxiety or something

26
0:0:47,92 --> 0:0:49,98
But they just don’t want to meet the delivery guy

27
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:51,5
But generally speaking

28
0:0:51,5 --> 0:0:53,58
Not only open the door for the delivery guy

29
0:0:53,58 --> 0:0:54,68
But give him a nod

30
0:0:54,68 --> 0:0:55,48
Thank you, sir

31
0:0:55,48 --> 0:0:56,78
Often times

32
0:0:56,78 --> 0:0:58,7
If the delivery person comes often enough

33
0:0:58,7 --> 0:1:1,32
I would offer him drinks, fans, and such

34
0:1:1,32 --> 0:1:3,28
This is a very common thing

35
0:1:3,28 --> 0:1:4,98
It’s not about how much these things cost

36
0:1:4,98 --> 0:1:6,9
It’s the thought that counts

37
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:10,78
So everyone's approach to handling problems is entirely different.

38
0:1:10,78 --> 0:1:11,74
Just as the saying goes, 'In the nick of time'.

39
0:1:11,74 --> 0:1:13,6
I just received a package.

40
0:1:13,6 --> 0:1:14,99
I just got some takeout.

41
0:1:14,99 --> 0:1:17,77
Often, when I talk about how we evaluate ourselves,

42
0:1:17,77 --> 0:1:19,45
our self-examination,

43
0:1:19,45 --> 0:1:22,41
sometimes we automatically assume that

44
0:1:22,41 --> 0:1:24,31
everyone in the world is just like us,

45
0:1:24,31 --> 0:1:25,73
that they share the same perspective as we do.

46
0:1:25,73 --> 0:1:26,61
An action

47
0:1:26,61 --> 0:1:27,96
The circumstances we encounter are the same

48
0:1:27,96 --> 0:1:31,28
But in many cases, the attitudes we face

49
0:1:31,28 --> 0:1:34,48
The behaviors and situations are vastly different from others

50
0:1:34,48 --> 0:1:36,24
I'm not just talking about food delivery

51
0:1:36,24 --> 0:1:37,32
In many instances

52
0:1:37,32 --> 0:1:40,0
We assume others are just as good as us

53
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:42,58
In reality, others are not as good as we are

54
0:1:42,58 --> 0:1:45,96
Others might not even be one-tenth as good as us

55
0:1:45,96 --> 0:1:48,56
Sometimes you might feel everyone is just as bad

56
0:1:48,56 --> 0:1:51,54
but it's possible others don't encounter the same bad things you do

57
0:1:51,54 --> 0:1:53,85
life might not be as painful as you think

58
0:1:53,85 --> 0:1:56,33
life isn't as good as you make it out to be

59
0:1:56,33 --> 0:1:58,9
nor as bad as others say

60
0:1:58,9 --> 0:1:59,7
it's not really that painful

61
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:2,9
a lot of things require empathy to truly understand

62
0:2:2,9 --> 0:2:4,95
you can't really feel what others are going through

63
0:2:4,95 --> 0:2:6,1
that's a tough one

64
0:2:6,1 --> 0:2:8,13
You can't really know for sure

65
0:2:8,13 --> 0:2:11,0
how others feel about you

66
0:2:11,6 --> 0:2:13,56
Let me elaborate on this

67
0:2:13,56 --> 0:2:14,92
In many cases

68
0:2:14,92 --> 0:2:18,39
like when I went to La Dao's exhibition

69
0:2:18,39 --> 0:2:19,95
attending La Dao's exhibition

70
0:2:19,95 --> 0:2:21,15
I was wearing flip-flops

71
0:2:21,15 --> 0:2:23,95
my usual white shirt for shoots

72
0:2:23,95 --> 0:2:25,579
and black pants, I just went

73
0:2:25,579 --> 0:2:27,419
There are many people here today

74
0:2:27,419 --> 0:2:29,279
most of them are UPloaders from Bilibili

75
0:2:29,279 --> 0:2:30,939
and there are also a lot of media representatives

76
0:2:30,939 --> 0:2:32,71
everyone is dressed very well

77
0:2:32,71 --> 0:2:34,51
I'm the only one who's dressed pretty casually

78
0:2:34,51 --> 0:2:36,15
but everyone knows I'm usually casual

79
0:2:36,15 --> 0:2:38,35
because I'm just casual all the time

80
0:2:38,35 --> 0:2:39,47
it's this kind of vibe

81
0:2:39,47 --> 0:2:40,99
so many people think, 'Oh, Rong Dao'

82
0:2:40,99 --> 0:2:42,71
You've got quite an attitude there.

83
0:2:42,71 --> 0:2:45,45
Are you really not at all concerned about how others perceive you?

84
0:2:45,45 --> 0:2:49,12
I think the issue is that you don't fully understand what others really think of you.

85
0:2:49,12 --> 0:2:51,51
What exactly is their impression of you?

86
0:2:51,51 --> 0:2:54,47
Many people think that wearing the most worn-out clothes makes the strongest impression.

87
0:2:54,47 --> 0:2:56,43
This way, people remember me the most.

88
0:2:56,43 --> 0:2:57,71
But that's not entirely true.

89
0:2:57,71 --> 0:2:59,74
Or perhaps Director Arong is just different.

90
0:2:59,74 --> 0:3:2,2
He can simply ignore how others feel about him.

91
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:2,94
Actually, not really.

92
0:3:2,94 --> 0:3:4,1
I do have my pride.

93
0:3:4,1 --> 0:3:5,6
I do have feelings.

94
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:6,86
But why do I dare to act this way?

95
0:3:6,86 --> 0:3:8,42
It’s because I understand it all too well.

96
0:3:8,42 --> 0:3:10,9
Often, we can sense things ourselves.

97
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:12,26
For instance, I might feel my outfit today isn’t great.

98
0:3:12,26 --> 0:3:14,5
Or that my hair today isn’t looking good.

99
0:3:14,5 --> 0:3:15,9
Or that I’m not in the best state today.

100
0:3:15,9 --> 0:3:18,45
You always feel that others will have a poor impression of you.

101
0:3:18,45 --> 0:3:19,35
People might say, 'Oh,

102
0:3:19,35 --> 0:3:20,71
look at how yellow this person's teeth are.'

103
0:3:20,71 --> 0:3:22,19
Look at how bald this person is.'

104
0:3:22,19 --> 0:3:23,67
Look at how overweight this person is, and so on.

105
0:3:23,67 --> 0:3:25,97
But in reality, in this world,

106
0:3:25,97 --> 0:3:28,45
most people are more concerned about themselves.

107
0:3:28,45 --> 0:3:29,99
What they think about,

108
0:3:29,99 --> 0:3:32,62
first and foremost, is whether they look good or not.

109
0:3:32,62 --> 0:3:34,58
But once people see me,

110
0:3:34,58 --> 0:3:36,24
they all feel that they look great,

111
0:3:36,24 --> 0:3:38,78
and standing next to me makes them feel even better.

112
0:3:38,78 --> 0:3:41,499
So this is what we call the 'Short Person Effect'.

113
0:3:41,499 --> 0:3:42,679
That's just how it works,

114
0:3:42,679 --> 0:3:44,859
if you find someone shorter than you,

115
0:3:44,859 --> 0:3:46,399
you won't feel short anymore.

116
0:3:46,399 --> 0:3:48,71
Even if you're actually one of the shorter people in the room,

117
0:3:48,71 --> 0:3:50,39
that's just the way it is.

118
0:3:50,39 --> 0:3:52,95
You've given someone an anchor point

119
0:3:52,95 --> 0:3:56,79
You've provided them with an opportunity to boost their self-esteem

120
0:3:56,79 --> 0:4:0,39
This is the reverse psychology I'm utilizing

121
0:4:0,39 --> 0:4:1,87
So in many cases

122
0:4:1,87 --> 0:4:3,37
Even if I carefully pick

123
0:4:3,37 --> 0:4:5,47
I carefully dress myself up

124
0:4:5,47 --> 0:4:7,75
My weaknesses will still be there

125
0:4:7,75 --> 0:4:9,35
It's just a matter of whether others notice them or not

126
0:4:9,35 --> 0:4:10,51
And more often than not

127
0:4:10,51 --> 0:4:13,15
Often, you might feel that others look down on you

128
0:4:13,15 --> 0:4:14,579
or think highly of you, and so on

129
0:4:14,579 --> 0:4:15,299
let me tell you

130
0:4:15,299 --> 0:4:16,539
at the parties I attend

131
0:4:16,539 --> 0:4:18,779
I've worn shabby clothes plenty of times

132
0:4:18,779 --> 0:4:20,299
I'm completely

133
0:4:20,299 --> 0:4:21,779
I have a don't give a damn look, you know

134
0:4:21,779 --> 0:4:24,2
I simply don't care how others perceive me

135
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:26,8
I don't care about those who look down on me

136
0:4:26,8 --> 0:4:29,12
It won’t really affect me

137
0:4:29,12 --> 0:4:31,5
Because most people have no real connection to you

138
0:4:31,5 --> 0:4:33,56
Even if you exchange WeChats with most people

139
0:4:33,56 --> 0:4:35,14
You won’t have much in common

140
0:4:35,14 --> 0:4:38,1
Most people are just passing through your life

141
0:4:38,1 --> 0:4:40,86
But if you can feel at ease wherever you are

142
0:4:40,86 --> 0:4:42,81
That’s a precious asset

143
0:4:42,81 --> 0:4:44,69
So we often say

144
0:4:44,69 --> 0:4:46,7
Don’t worry about it

145
0:4:46,7 --> 0:4:47,21
Some of your things

146
0:4:47,21 --> 0:4:50,5
Because some of your things might be completely different from others'

147
0:4:50,5 --> 0:4:52,53
What you care about might not matter to others at all

148
0:4:52,53 --> 0:4:55,21
Like when I go to open the door to welcome the delivery guy

149
0:4:55,21 --> 0:4:57,1
Because I think it's a matter of my upbringing

150
0:4:57,1 --> 0:4:58,3
It’s part of my normal routine

151
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:0,18
I’m willing to interact more with working people

152
0:5:0,18 --> 0:5:3,46
I’m willing to connect more with these hardworking folks

153
0:5:3,46 --> 0:5:6,28
And I feel there’s no difference between me and them

154
0:5:6,28 --> 0:5:7,52
But many people are different

155
0:5:7,52 --> 0:5:8,68
I've already had takeout

156
0:5:8,68 --> 0:5:10,12
I'm at the office

157
0:5:10,12 --> 0:5:11,24
I'm a white-collar worker

158
0:5:11,24 --> 0:5:12,78
I'm really different from you guys

159
0:5:12,78 --> 0:5:13,38
Right?

160
0:5:13,38 --> 0:5:14,92
What about you, just a delivery guy

161
0:5:14,92 --> 0:5:15,56
How can you do that

162
0:5:15,56 --> 0:5:17,89
That's why people have different perspectives

163
0:5:17,89 --> 0:5:19,85
So, people are different from one another.

164
0:5:19,85 --> 0:5:20,97
From this perspective,

165
0:5:20,97 --> 0:5:22,73
we need to remind everyone,

166
0:5:22,73 --> 0:5:25,49
that sometimes your moral standards may be higher than others',

167
0:5:25,49 --> 0:5:27,169
and you might not even realize it.

168
0:5:27,169 --> 0:5:28,569
Another point is to tell you,

169
0:5:28,569 --> 0:5:30,449
what others truly feel,

170
0:5:30,449 --> 0:5:32,489
what others are truly passionate about,

171
0:5:32,489 --> 0:5:33,9
may not be important to you.

172
0:5:33,9 --> 0:5:35,74
There's also one major issue that is

173
0:5:35,74 --> 0:5:38,66
Actually, I later talked with a few UPloaders who I got along well with that day

174
0:5:38,66 --> 0:5:39,22
I said

175
0:5:39,22 --> 0:5:43,46
It's really that you can't tell how much someone earns just by looking at them

176
0:5:43,46 --> 0:5:45,94
But you can tell how much they're willing to spend from their appearance

177
0:5:45,94 --> 0:5:46,58
You know what I mean

178
0:5:46,58 --> 0:5:49,58
I believe if someone really earns a lot of money

179
0:5:49,58 --> 0:5:50,78
It doesn't matter if they spend a bit

180
0:5:50,78 --> 0:5:52,24
This aligns with their social status

181
0:5:52,24 --> 0:5:54,64
But when I wasn't making much money,

182
0:5:54,64 --> 0:5:56,8
I was willing to use my external spending behavior

183
0:5:56,8 --> 0:5:59,79
to show how much I actually earned back then.

184
0:5:59,79 --> 0:6:2,71
I should have been in a state of not making money,

185
0:6:2,71 --> 0:6:4,3
giving others that impression.

186
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:5,37
However, most people,

187
0:6:5,37 --> 0:6:7,95
even if they haven't earned that much money,

188
0:6:7,95 --> 0:6:9,299
still spend a lot of money,

189
0:6:9,299 --> 0:6:12,479
and they don't want others to feel they can't afford to spend so much.

190
0:6:12,479 --> 0:6:14,46
So this is the biggest difference among people.

191
0:6:14,46 --> 0:6:16,14
For example, if I earn 100 yuan,

192
0:6:16,14 --> 0:6:17,46
I might feel pained to spend even one.

193
0:6:17,46 --> 0:6:18,62
Some people might earn just ten yuan,

194
0:6:18,62 --> 0:6:19,98
but they don't feel bad spending five or six.

195
0:6:19,98 --> 0:6:21,61
So this is the difference between individuals.

196
0:6:21,61 --> 0:6:24,13
What really makes the difference between us?

197
0:6:24,13 --> 0:6:25,37
When it truly matters,

198
0:6:25,37 --> 0:6:29,889
is that one day you might do something I can't.

199
0:6:29,889 --> 0:6:32,709
That’s how I feel we’re all unique.

200
0:6:32,709 --> 0:6:34,429
So, just by looking at what people wear,

201
0:6:34,429 --> 0:6:37,62
I think a lot of people in the fashion industry or those who study art,

202
0:6:37,62 --> 0:6:38,46
or those who study fine arts,

203
0:6:38,46 --> 0:6:39,81
usually dress really well,

204
0:6:39,81 --> 0:6:41,69
but in reality, their earning power,

205
0:6:41,69 --> 0:6:43,79
is actually inversely proportional to their style.

206
0:6:43,79 --> 0:6:45,69
So, there’s no real correlation here.

207
0:6:45,69 --> 0:6:47,65
In fact, the better you dress,

208
0:6:47,65 --> 0:6:48,17
How to put it

209
0:6:48,17 --> 0:6:50,41
Considering one's true identity and status

210
0:6:50,41 --> 0:6:51,89
And the actual income level

211
0:6:51,89 --> 0:6:55,7
For me, it can also occupy more, how to say

212
0:6:55,7 --> 0:6:56,8
Profit margin

213
0:6:56,8 --> 0:6:57,98
Most of the time

214
0:6:57,98 --> 0:7:1,22
If others feel that I come across better in comparison

215
0:7:1,22 --> 0:7:2,5
Speaking of which

216
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:4,65
I might feel more at ease

217
0:7:4,65 --> 0:7:5,69
Of course

218
0:7:5,69 --> 0:7:9,13
I'm also doing it to strengthen my will and character

219
0:7:9,13 --> 0:7:11,77
In such situations, I can still feel good about myself

220
0:7:11,77 --> 0:7:12,65
Without embarrassing myself

221
0:7:12,65 --> 0:7:14,23
Then you truly are at ease

222
0:7:14,23 --> 0:7:17,3
You won't be held back by external things

223
0:7:17,3 --> 0:7:18,63
So at that point

224
0:7:18,63 --> 0:7:20,99
You really reach a state where

225
0:7:20,99 --> 0:7:22,55
What you wear doesn't matter

226
0:7:22,55 --> 0:7:23,63
I don't really care what I wear

227
0:7:23,63 --> 0:7:25,67
It's like when Mi Heng played the drum, it doesn't matter

228
0:7:25,67 --> 0:7:28,62
So this is a person's, how to say it

229
0:7:28,62 --> 0:7:29,66
A strategy in life

230
0:7:29,66 --> 0:7:32,24
I'd rather lose face at a critical moment

231
0:7:32,24 --> 0:7:34,67
Than to spend money frequently

232
0:7:34,67 --> 0:7:35,75
For seasonal changes

233
0:7:35,75 --> 0:7:37,25
Always buying new clothes

234
0:7:37,25 --> 0:7:38,65
I keep buying books

235
0:7:38,65 --> 0:7:39,75
Keep buying games

236
0:7:39,75 --> 0:7:42,38
But I really don't spend much on clothes
