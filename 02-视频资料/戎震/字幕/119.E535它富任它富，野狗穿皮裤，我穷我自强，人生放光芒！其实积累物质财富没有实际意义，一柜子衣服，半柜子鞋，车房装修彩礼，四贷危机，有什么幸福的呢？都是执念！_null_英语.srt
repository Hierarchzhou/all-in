1
0:0:0,48 --> 0:0:2,46
Hey everyone, it's a new episode!

2
0:0:2,46 --> 0:0:4,64
Today, we're getting back to work.

3
0:0:4,64 --> 0:0:10,44
Yesterday, I had a cup of that blue glass yogurt, which is supposed to be probiotic.

4
0:0:10,44 --> 0:0:12,1
At first, people said,

5
0:0:12,1 --> 0:0:15,2
you'd feel an earthquake in three hours.

6
0:0:15,2 --> 0:0:16,34
They insisted you should stay close to the bathroom.

7
0:0:16,34 --> 0:0:17,66
I said, 'No big deal.'

8
0:0:17,66 --> 0:0:20,9
But after waiting for three hours, there wasn't much of a reaction.

9
0:0:20,9 --> 0:0:22,2
I just had to go to the bathroom once.

10
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:23,98
I've already been to the bathroom twice today.

11
0:0:23,98 --> 0:0:24,9
And just now, I went again.

12
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:25,26
All together,

13
0:0:25,26 --> 0:0:26,989
that makes four times.

14
0:0:26,989 --> 0:0:28,409
By the time night fell,

15
0:0:28,409 --> 0:0:30,469
my stomach suddenly started rumbling like thunder.

16
0:0:30,469 --> 0:0:32,949
It was like a whole orchestra playing drums and cymbals in there.

17
0:0:32,949 --> 0:0:35,55
Then I thought, maybe it’s good to eat more probiotics.

18
0:0:35,55 --> 0:0:37,87
Actually, I have two types of probiotics at home.

19
0:0:37,87 --> 0:0:39,25
I usually don’t eat much.

20
0:0:39,25 --> 0:0:42,66
Actually, boosting your metabolism can prevent you from gaining too much weight.

21
0:0:42,66 --> 0:0:43,52
Of course,

22
0:0:43,52 --> 0:0:46,6
if you really want to lose weight, you should exercise.

23
0:0:46,6 --> 0:0:48,28
Whether it’s strength training or cardio,

24
0:0:48,28 --> 0:0:50,8
this is a healthy way to maintain your fitness.

25
0:0:50,8 --> 0:0:51,1
You can’t rely solely on medication,

26
0:0:51,1 --> 0:0:52,58
that’s just a waste of money.

27
0:0:52,58 --> 0:0:54,69
I’ve paid my fair share of that waste.

28
0:0:54,69 --> 0:0:58,87
In this episode, I want to talk about a strategy for life.

29
0:0:58,87 --> 0:1:1,29
Because everyone has been pretty upset about the 4+4 thing recently.

30
0:1:1,29 --> 0:1:3,98
It's really been bothering people.

31
0:1:4,22 --> 0:1:8,49
If I were to go back to my twenties,

32
0:1:8,49 --> 0:1:9,73
Not just my twenties,

33
0:1:9,73 --> 0:1:10,81
I mean, my body,

34
0:1:10,81 --> 0:1:13,59
If I suddenly found myself back in my twenties,

35
0:1:13,59 --> 0:1:15,31
If my age suddenly became 20 again,

36
0:1:15,31 --> 0:1:17,59
I'm talking about people born in 2005.

37
0:1:17,59 --> 0:1:20,94
My feelings now are quite different.

38
0:1:20,94 --> 0:1:24,4
But everyone has their own way, you know.

39
0:1:24,4 --> 0:1:27,63
Each era has its own dark night of the soul.

40
0:1:27,63 --> 0:1:29,41
Each has its own challenges to overcome.

41
0:1:29,41 --> 0:1:31,35
There's no easy solution.

42
0:1:31,35 --> 0:1:33,55
But I want to share this point with everyone.

43
0:1:33,55 --> 0:1:35,43
When playing chess,

44
0:1:35,43 --> 0:1:36,49
there's a method,

45
0:1:36,49 --> 0:1:39,77
a winning strategy called the Three-Pawn Checkmate.

46
0:1:39,77 --> 0:1:42,75
This method is something my dad loves to use.

47
0:1:42,75 --> 0:1:44,3
You all know about chess,

48
0:1:44,3 --> 0:1:45,33
and Shogi from Japan,

49
0:1:45,33 --> 0:1:48,62
where when you reach the last rank, you can promote the piece.

50
0:1:48,62 --> 0:1:51,78
I think it’s called something like a silver general turning into a gold general or something like that.

51
0:1:51,78 --> 0:1:54,1
Anyway, I don’t really understand Japanese chess,

52
0:1:54,1 --> 0:1:56,38
but in chess, you know you can use a pawn,

53
0:1:56,38 --> 0:1:57,42
to promote it to a queen.

54
0:1:59,5 --> 0:2:1,97
But rather than talking about these things,

55
0:2:1,97 --> 0:2:4,34
My dad is quite into playing cards.

56
0:2:4,34 --> 0:2:6,2
And he also enjoys playing chess and the like.

57
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:8,76
His strategic thinking in games has deeply influenced me.

58
0:2:8,76 --> 0:2:10,53
He plays cards really well.

59
0:2:10,53 --> 0:2:12,33
I’ve inherited that from him.

60
0:2:12,33 --> 0:2:15,31
But I don’t gamble, you know.

61
0:2:15,31 --> 0:2:16,73
I don’t have a gambling habit.

62
0:2:16,73 --> 0:2:18,29
Dad loves to cry, Mom focuses on her studies, and my younger brother is very understanding.

63
0:2:18,29 --> 0:2:18,65
He’s very mature for his age.

64
0:2:18,65 --> 0:2:20,47
He's not like that, you know.

65
0:2:20,47 --> 0:2:22,31
But my dad doesn't play anymore either.

66
0:2:22,31 --> 0:2:23,19
He's old, right?

67
0:2:23,19 --> 0:2:24,7
He stays at home now.

68
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:27,25
My mom is pretty strict with him.

69
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:29,89
But he plays chess really well.

70
0:2:29,89 --> 0:2:30,75
Three pawns checkmating the king.

71
0:2:30,75 --> 0:2:31,33
Three pawns checkmating the king.

72
0:2:31,33 --> 0:2:34,55
Basically, it means using your least noticeable pieces.

73
0:2:34,55 --> 0:2:36,23
to gain a strategic advantage

74
0:2:36,23 --> 0:2:37,81
because you have five pawns

75
0:2:37,81 --> 0:2:39,97
two chariots, two horses, and two cannons

76
0:2:39,97 --> 0:2:44,34
most people prefer to use their chariots, horses, and cannons or to exchange them with the opponent's

77
0:2:44,34 --> 0:2:46,86
first, eliminate the opponent's superior forces

78
0:2:46,86 --> 0:2:49,53
but they usually don't use the pawns

79
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:51,71
we say that using pawns skillfully is an art

80
0:2:53,15 --> 0:2:54,65
if you look at many people

81
0:2:54,65 --> 0:2:56,93
when it comes to philosophical aspects of life

82
0:2:56,93 --> 0:2:59,739
Actually, when it comes to the Chinese people,

83
0:2:59,739 --> 0:3:3,19
our general philosophical literacy is quite high.

84
0:3:3,19 --> 0:3:5,26
In this regard,

85
0:3:5,26 --> 0:3:8,94
because Western countries promote a happiness-oriented education,

86
0:3:8,94 --> 0:3:11,3
and they intentionally aim to create

87
0:3:11,3 --> 0:3:13,7
a distinction in culture and knowledge

88
0:3:13,7 --> 0:3:17,15
between the propertied and the propertyless classes.

89
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:20,77
Therefore, they have private education systems with prestigious universities,

90
0:3:20,77 --> 0:3:22,39
and so on.

91
0:3:22,39 --> 0:3:24,499
This joyful education encompasses a lot of aspects.

92
0:3:24,499 --> 0:3:27,39
It actually widens the gap between the rich and the poor.

93
0:3:27,39 --> 0:3:30,269
His elite education is quite different from his education for the masses.

94
0:3:30,269 --> 0:3:32,969
Cough, cough, and then someone pointed out that

95
0:3:32,969 --> 0:3:34,3
There's a 4+4 system in the country.

96
0:3:34,3 --> 0:3:35,58
We need to say that

97
0:3:35,58 --> 0:3:37,34
In many cases,

98
0:3:37,34 --> 0:3:39,74
You can't prevent certain people

99
0:3:39,74 --> 0:3:41,64
From seeking advantages for their own children.

100
0:3:41,64 --> 0:3:43,73
This thing is what you're talking about completely.

101
0:3:43,73 --> 0:3:45,8
It's not true that he doesn't consider his children.

102
0:3:45,8 --> 0:3:47,4
But in general terms,

103
0:3:47,4 --> 0:3:48,72
To a greater extent,

104
0:3:48,72 --> 0:3:50,92
It's not about recruiting thousands of people.

105
0:3:50,92 --> 0:3:52,82
I'm not trying to defend this.

106
0:3:52,82 --> 0:3:53,74
Let me add,

107
0:3:53,74 --> 0:3:54,5
We can't say that,

108
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:56,26
Because of these corrupt elements.

109
0:3:56,26 --> 0:3:57,66
With these people taking backdoors

110
0:3:57,66 --> 0:3:59,34
you lose your own confidence

111
0:3:59,34 --> 0:4:2,79
you lose faith in your own life

112
0:4:2,79 --> 0:4:4,999
you develop a pessimistic attitude towards the world

113
0:4:4,999 --> 0:4:5,739
Don't be like that

114
0:4:5,739 --> 0:4:7,829
Why is it called a three-soldiers siege?

115
0:4:7,829 --> 0:4:10,169
We don't have any major pieces like chariots, horses, or cannons

116
0:4:10,169 --> 0:4:12,589
Rong was born just like you

117
0:4:18,479 --> 0:4:20,959
He doesn't even own a car

118
0:4:20,959 --> 0:4:21,679
Not a single car

119
0:4:21,679 --> 0:4:22,879
No house of your own

120
0:4:22,879 --> 0:4:25,379
Haha, you must feel pretty unlucky to end up like this

121
0:4:25,379 --> 0:4:27,4
You must feel pretty embarrassed, right?

122
0:4:27,4 --> 0:4:28,42
It’s not a big deal

123
0:4:28,42 --> 0:4:30,1
Actually, Brother Rong is in the same boat as you

124
0:4:30,1 --> 0:4:31,74
But when it comes to Brother Rong

125
0:4:31,74 --> 0:4:33,92
He does have one advantage over you

126
0:4:33,92 --> 0:4:35,66
He managed to avoid some pitfalls

127
0:4:35,66 --> 0:4:37,58
This brings up that book I mentioned about avoiding pitfalls.

128
0:4:37,58 --> 0:4:38,9
But that book isn't crucial.

129
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:42,96
I think the book talks about many pitfalls in your life.

130
0:4:42,96 --> 0:4:44,96
Financial pitfalls can be avoided if you're careful.

131
0:4:44,96 --> 0:4:46,76
Let's talk about the subprime mortgage crisis.

132
0:4:46,76 --> 0:4:48,44
Mortgage, car loan, and renovation loan.

133
0:4:48,44 --> 0:4:48,98
And wedding gift loan.

134
0:4:48,98 --> 0:4:50,74
If you avoid all these four loan crises,

135
0:4:50,74 --> 0:4:52,44
Then you'll avoid many financial pitfalls.

136
0:4:52,44 --> 0:4:53,8
You just need to avoid it.

137
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:55,669
For example, when you have 10,000.

138
0:4:55,669 --> 0:4:56,829
We don’t buy phones on a whim.

139
0:4:56,829 --> 0:4:57,489
We don’t buy computers on a whim.

140
0:4:57,489 --> 0:4:58,809
When you have 100,000, don’t buy a car on a whim.

141
0:4:58,809 --> 0:5:0,109
When you have 300,000, don’t invest recklessly.

142
0:5:0,109 --> 0:5:1,19
Don’t buy a house.

143
0:5:1,19 --> 0:5:2,67
When you have 1 million, don’t lend money recklessly.

144
0:5:2,67 --> 0:5:3,71
When you have 3 million, don’t engage in reckless activities.

145
0:5:3,71 --> 0:5:5,87
Don't get swayed by the big talk when you hit 30 million.

146
0:5:5,87 --> 0:5:7,48
Just like Brother Daxiang.

147
0:5:7,48 --> 0:5:10,56
So sometimes, as long as you avoid these pitfalls,

148
0:5:10,56 --> 0:5:12,36
life can still be straightforward.

149
0:5:12,36 --> 0:5:13,2
You can live comfortably,

150
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:14,12
very at ease.

151
0:5:14,12 --> 0:5:15,6
It's definitely like that.

152
0:5:15,6 --> 0:5:17,299
When it comes to strategy,

153
0:5:17,299 --> 0:5:18,939
maintain strategic focus.

154
0:5:18,939 --> 0:5:19,539
A confidence

155
0:5:19,539 --> 0:5:22,319
Just like our arduous Anti-Japanese War

156
0:5:22,319 --> 0:5:24,28
And the Liberation War

157
0:5:24,28 --> 0:5:26,1
Strategically, as long as we win

158
0:5:26,1 --> 0:5:28,32
As long as the people are in charge

159
0:5:28,32 --> 0:5:29,64
Utilize unity

160
0:5:29,64 --> 0:5:31,26
The power of the people

161
0:5:31,26 --> 0:5:32,18
Can mobilize the masses

162
0:5:32,18 --> 0:5:33,2
That's the key point

163
0:5:33,2 --> 0:5:36,13
You rely on the people in your strategy

164
0:5:36,13 --> 0:5:37,47
The banner of strategy is right

165
0:5:37,47 --> 0:5:39,87
In the future, what you're actually doing in your life

166
0:5:39,87 --> 0:5:41,7
Oh, be honest and straightforward

167
0:5:41,7 --> 0:5:42,5
It doesn't matter

168
0:5:42,5 --> 0:5:45,14
We're discussing just the personal

169
0:5:45,14 --> 0:5:48,32
Whether one can be completely economically independent

170
0:5:48,32 --> 0:5:49,84
But speaking of being not entirely independent

171
0:5:49,84 --> 0:5:50,86
That's fine too

172
0:5:50,86 --> 0:5:52,4
There's not much to it.

173
0:5:52,4 --> 0:5:55,8
You need to understand the difference between you and the rich kids.

174
0:5:55,8 --> 0:5:56,88
It's that they have luxury cars.

175
0:5:56,88 --> 0:5:58,16
They have better hobbies.

176
0:5:58,16 --> 0:5:59,7
They have better partners.

177
0:5:59,7 --> 0:6:1,3
And they eat better.

178
0:6:1,3 --> 0:6:2,62
That's about it.

179
0:6:2,62 --> 0:6:4,54
Then you think about the cost of this life.

180
0:6:4,54 --> 0:6:5,5
Look at me, I'm 40 years old.

181
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:6,48
Do I envy them?

182
0:6:6,48 --> 0:6:8,38
If you ask me, I really did envy them when I was young.

183
0:6:8,38 --> 0:6:9,38
Back when I was young,

184
0:6:9,38 --> 0:6:12,389
all these things people have, in the process of competition,

185
0:6:12,389 --> 0:6:15,39
in the pursuit of mating rights,

186
0:6:15,39 --> 0:6:16,319
comparing yourself to others,

187
0:6:16,319 --> 0:6:17,559
having this competitive mindset,

188
0:6:17,559 --> 0:6:18,619
makes a person different.

189
0:6:18,619 --> 0:6:20,159
But by the time you hit 40,

190
0:6:20,159 --> 0:6:24,51
You suddenly feel that many people die in their thirties or forties.

191
0:6:24,51 --> 0:6:27,1
And they didn't even live as long as I have.

192
0:6:27,1 --> 0:6:28,58
So don't compare these things with me.

193
0:6:28,58 --> 0:6:29,5
Don't compare health with me either.

194
0:6:29,5 --> 0:6:30,38
You can't outdo me.

195
0:6:30,38 --> 0:6:31,2
If you compare hair volume,

196
0:6:31,2 --> 0:6:31,94
You still can't outdo me.

197
0:6:31,94 --> 0:6:33,34
At this point, if we compare again,

198
0:6:33,34 --> 0:6:35,33
Some people's family backgrounds are just not as good.

199
0:6:35,33 --> 0:6:36,73
All of a sudden, this rich second generation

200
0:6:36,73 --> 0:6:38,659
many people aren't as impressive as they used to be

201
0:6:38,659 --> 0:6:40,439
but of course, the truly impressive ones remain so

202
0:6:40,439 --> 0:6:42,259
while those who aren't impressive sometimes fall halfway

203
0:6:42,259 --> 0:6:43,559
you'll suddenly realize

204
0:6:43,559 --> 0:6:45,99
how they rose to great heights

205
0:6:45,99 --> 0:6:46,74
and then, how to put it

206
0:6:46,74 --> 0:6:48,8
they fall back to their original state

207
0:6:48,8 --> 0:6:50,34
so there are many people like this

208
0:6:50,34 --> 0:6:53,99
After reaching a high level of development,

209
0:6:53,99 --> 0:6:57,2
he then experienced rapid growth with high debt,

210
0:6:57,2 --> 0:6:58,4
so often times,

211
0:6:58,4 --> 0:7:0,68
we say a person's life has its ups and downs several times,

212
0:7:0,68 --> 0:7:2,2
don't get too anxious all of a sudden,

213
0:7:2,2 --> 0:7:4,78
saying I'm 20 and haven't,

214
0:7:4,78 --> 0:7:5,7
saved up a million by 30,

215
0:7:5,7 --> 0:7:6,58
I haven't reached 30,

216
0:7:6,58 --> 0:7:8,62
and haven't established my own business by 35.

217
0:7:8,62 --> 0:7:9,44
It hasn’t gone public yet.

218
0:7:9,44 --> 0:7:10,68
I feel like such a failure.

219
0:7:10,68 --> 0:7:11,38
Don’t think like that.

220
0:7:11,38 --> 0:7:11,92
Don’t think like that.

221
0:7:11,92 --> 0:7:12,84
Look at me, I’m still nothing.

222
0:7:12,84 --> 0:7:13,69
That’s not true, right?

223
0:7:13,69 --> 0:7:15,57
I’m only getting there by June this year.

224
0:7:15,57 --> 0:7:18,99
I can only get a slot on either May 26th or 28th this year.

225
0:7:18,99 --> 0:7:19,53
I still have to use it.

226
0:7:19,53 --> 0:7:20,21
My parents

227
0:7:20,21 --> 0:7:23,23
in this three-generation family with my son

228
0:7:23,23 --> 0:7:24,59
have to enter a lottery to get a license plate

229
0:7:24,59 --> 0:7:26,94
but what use is a car to me?

230
0:7:26,94 --> 0:7:28,1
I don’t commute these days

231
0:7:28,1 --> 0:7:28,58
right?

232
0:7:28,58 --> 0:7:31,419
So owning a car is more about face

233
0:7:31,419 --> 0:7:33,159
and I still have to pay for depreciation

234
0:7:33,159 --> 0:7:33,839
and insurance

235
0:7:33,839 --> 0:7:34,819
Parking fees

236
0:7:34,819 --> 0:7:36,11
In Beijing

237
0:7:36,144 --> 0:7:37,67
In congested areas

238
0:7:37,67 --> 0:7:38,67
Generally speaking

239
0:7:38,67 --> 0:7:40,57
the drivers' skills are not great

240
0:7:40,57 --> 0:7:41,75
In places where there's no traffic

241
0:7:41,75 --> 0:7:42,97
like outside the Sixth Ring Road

242
0:7:42,97 --> 0:7:45,74
drivers from outside the Fifth Ring Road and in county towns

243
0:7:45,74 --> 0:7:47,28
their driving skills are excellent

244
0:7:47,28 --> 0:7:48,8
This is a young follower of mine.

245
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:50,68
She's a girl from Xi'an, WBY.

246
0:7:50,68 --> 0:7:52,23
She said,

247
0:7:52,23 --> 0:7:53,95
the less developed the transportation is,

248
0:7:53,95 --> 0:7:54,75
the places where there's no traffic jam,

249
0:7:54,75 --> 0:7:56,91
the better the drivers' skills tend to be.

250
0:7:56,91 --> 0:7:59,72
Places like where you are, with constant traffic jams, don't really help to hone those skills.

251
0:7:59,72 --> 0:8:1,1
People tend to go out less often,

252
0:8:1,1 --> 0:8:2,28
spending their days stuck in traffic.

253
0:8:2,28 --> 0:8:2,8
How do you practice?

254
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:3,12
Right?

255
0:8:3,12 --> 0:8:6,2
You're just practicing how to handle traffic accidents, right?

256
0:8:6,2 --> 0:8:7,629
This one is actually practiced quite well.

257
0:8:7,629 --> 0:8:8,869
To train your temperament, right?

258
0:8:8,869 --> 0:8:9,689
To practice road rage.

259
0:8:9,689 --> 0:8:10,789
This can actually be practiced.

260
0:8:10,789 --> 0:8:12,69
But other things can't be practiced.

261
0:8:12,69 --> 0:8:12,829
So when it comes to it,

262
0:8:12,829 --> 0:8:13,929
Everyone has their strengths

263
0:8:13,929 --> 0:8:15,3
and their weaknesses.

264
0:8:15,3 --> 0:8:16,86
I'm in this situation in Beijing

265
0:8:16,86 --> 0:8:18,46
You say I can't match Wang Sicong

266
0:8:18,46 --> 0:8:19,34
Can't match him, can't match him

267
0:8:19,34 --> 0:8:21,1
Why do I have to outdo him?

268
0:8:21,1 --> 0:8:22,62
Why do I have to outdo her?

269
0:8:22,62 --> 0:8:24,24
I can't be like these Ms. Dong

270
0:8:24,24 --> 0:8:25,44
Then I won't be like her.

271
0:8:25,44 --> 0:8:26,81
But I look better than her.

272
0:8:26,81 --> 0:8:27,97
I'm smarter than him.

273
0:8:27,97 --> 0:8:29,659
And he's now in disgrace.

274
0:8:29,659 --> 0:8:31,179
My life is going better than his.

275
0:8:31,179 --> 0:8:32,899
He might just have a bigger house.

276
0:8:32,899 --> 0:8:33,779
Drive a better car.

277
0:8:33,779 --> 0:8:35,219
But I don't live in my car all the time.

278
0:8:35,219 --> 0:8:36,59
Live in a bigger house.

279
0:8:36,59 --> 0:8:37,779
You still have to sleep in one bed, right?

280
0:8:37,779 --> 0:8:39,39
Your reputation is ruined, isn't it?

281
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:40,65
Your life has been wasted this way.

282
0:8:40,65 --> 0:8:42,15
You're currently staying in America to wait for production capacity.

283
0:8:42,15 --> 0:8:44,15
There's no such thing as an anchor baby in America anymore, right?

284
0:8:44,15 --> 0:8:45,31
Do you think you'll have to come back?

285
0:8:45,31 --> 0:8:45,59
Isn't that right?

286
0:8:45,59 --> 0:8:47,49
You'll still have to come back with your tail between your legs.

287
0:8:47,49 --> 0:8:48,81
Or how do you manage to stay abroad?

288
0:8:48,81 --> 0:8:50,49
What do you think life abroad is like?

289
0:8:50,49 --> 0:8:51,27
I've seen it too

290
0:8:51,27 --> 0:8:51,91
right?

291
0:8:51,91 --> 0:8:53,59
It's just about eating a bit better

292
0:8:53,59 --> 0:8:54,47
sleeping a bit better

293
0:8:54,47 --> 0:8:55,23
dressing a bit better

294
0:8:55,23 --> 0:8:56,75
There's not much to it really

295
0:8:56,75 --> 0:8:58,39
Do you think clothes are that important?

296
0:8:58,39 --> 0:8:59,87
If you don't care about appearances

297
0:8:59,87 --> 0:9:2,76
you might find that food, clothing, and cars aren't that important

298
0:9:2,76 --> 0:9:4,84
The one thing I'm really particular about is the house.

299
0:9:4,84 --> 0:9:6,28
I think it should be a bit bigger.

300
0:9:6,28 --> 0:9:7,28
So I can practice with swords and spears.

301
0:9:7,28 --> 0:9:8,44
And even shoot arrows inside.

302
0:9:8,44 --> 0:9:9,31
I think that would be great.

303
0:9:9,31 --> 0:9:10,51
But I also have cats at home.

304
0:9:10,51 --> 0:9:11,59
What if they get hurt?

305
0:9:11,59 --> 0:9:12,67
What if a child gets hurt?

306
0:9:12,67 --> 0:9:13,67
So as I get older,

307
0:9:13,67 --> 0:9:16,17
When it comes to martial arts skills,

308
0:9:16,17 --> 0:9:17,53
the requirements aren't as high.

309
0:9:17,53 --> 0:9:18,97
I've realized that in this lifetime,

310
0:9:18,97 --> 0:9:21,28
I feel that living near the second ring road now,

311
0:9:21,28 --> 0:9:22,8
having a smaller house is actually quite nice,

312
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:23,64
it's not a big deal,

313
0:9:23,64 --> 0:9:24,24
I don't have a car,

314
0:9:24,24 --> 0:9:26,36
but since I don't commute, it's actually pretty good,

315
0:9:26,36 --> 0:9:26,92
right?

316
0:9:26,92 --> 0:9:28,28
Friends who dress up a bit more

317
0:9:28,28 --> 0:9:29,76
I have just one piece of clothing per season

318
0:9:29,76 --> 0:9:30,8
I only have one pair of shoes

319
0:9:30,8 --> 0:9:32,88
unlike others who have 300 pairs in their shoe cabinets

320
0:9:32,88 --> 0:9:34,68
a whole wardrobe can't even fit them

321
0:9:34,68 --> 0:9:35,4
they need six wardrobes

322
0:9:35,4 --> 0:9:36,28
a pile of bags

323
0:9:36,28 --> 0:9:37,32
and they even have a dedicated wardrobe

324
0:9:37,32 --> 0:9:38,32
I think it’s like this

325
0:9:38,32 --> 0:9:40,21
Aren't you just falling into the trap of consumerism?

326
0:9:40,21 --> 0:9:41,73
And when I ultimately die,

327
0:9:41,73 --> 0:9:43,19
I can't take those things with me.

328
0:9:43,19 --> 0:9:43,65
Right?

329
0:9:43,65 --> 0:9:44,29
I can't take them with me.

330
0:9:44,29 --> 0:9:46,13
They'll just be left in the grave for others.

331
0:9:46,13 --> 0:9:46,71
Right?

332
0:9:46,71 --> 0:9:49,79
The thing I have the most at home now is books.

333
0:9:49,79 --> 0:9:51,19
Books aren't of much practical use.

334
0:9:51,19 --> 0:9:52,67
You can just toss it after reading.

335
0:9:52,67 --> 0:9:54,5
You can just give it away after you're done.

336
0:9:54,5 --> 0:9:55,78
It's not that useful anyway.

337
0:9:55,78 --> 0:9:56,9
I don't plan to keep it as a treasure.

338
0:9:56,9 --> 0:9:57,62
Unlike my books.

339
0:9:57,62 --> 0:10:0,65
I would definitely keep many copies of my own series.

340
0:10:0,65 --> 0:10:4,13
But now, a lot of books get thrown out once they're read.

341
0:10:4,13 --> 0:10:4,71
They get tossed after reading.

342
0:10:4,71 --> 0:10:9,939
So you'll find that you don't need a lot of things in life.

343
0:10:11,419 --> 0:10:13,62
So you need to make a lot of money

344
0:10:13,62 --> 0:10:16,82
The reason to acquire a lot of things doesn't exist

345
0:10:16,82 --> 0:10:19,14
I was born not caring much about food and clothes

346
0:10:19,14 --> 0:10:20,569
I might care a bit more about food

347
0:10:20,569 --> 0:10:22,649
But if you can cook for yourself

348
0:10:22,649 --> 0:10:23,929
If you buy the ingredients and cook yourself

349
0:10:23,929 --> 0:10:25,9
Isn't it much cheaper

350
0:10:25,9 --> 0:10:25,72
Right

351
0:10:25,72 --> 0:10:26,84
But now there's food delivery

352
0:10:26,84 --> 0:10:28,2
I need to order enough food to make use of the discount.

353
0:10:28,2 --> 0:10:30,51
With the coupons, I can still enjoy some really delicious meals.

354
0:10:30,51 --> 0:10:31,87
Let's talk about the food.

355
0:10:31,87 --> 0:10:33,47
Everyone has pretty much evened out.

356
0:10:33,47 --> 0:10:37,94
I guess everyone buys those luxury items at a 10% discount through DHgate.

357
0:10:37,94 --> 0:10:39,18
Is wearing fancy clothes that important?

358
0:10:39,18 --> 0:10:41,6
And who am I dressing up for anyway?

359
0:10:41,6 --> 0:10:42,14
Am I dressing up for my relatives?

360
0:10:42,14 --> 0:10:43,12
Or for my classmates?

361
0:10:43,12 --> 0:10:44,62
I don't really keep in touch with them

362
0:10:44,62 --> 0:10:46,2
How am I supposed to show them?

363
0:10:46,2 --> 0:10:46,599
Right?

364
0:10:46,599 --> 0:10:47,919
It doesn't make much sense anyway

365
0:10:47,919 --> 0:10:50,219
It's not like the feeling at the village entrance

366
0:10:50,219 --> 0:10:52,34
I bought a good car

367
0:10:52,34 --> 0:10:53,22
The weather is bad

368
0:10:53,22 --> 0:10:54,1
Who am I going to show it to?

369
0:10:54,1 --> 0:10:55,2
I'll just show it to my followers

370
0:10:55,2 --> 0:10:56,6
I might as well go out in the sun

371
0:10:56,6 --> 0:10:57,91
no one cares who cares

372
0:10:57,91 --> 0:11:0,13
I really want to buy the Xiaomi 13 Ultra, but it's too expensive

373
0:11:0,13 --> 0:11:1,75
maybe I should get a Wuling Hongguang instead

374
0:11:1,75 --> 0:11:3,28
just to secure a license plate spot

375
0:11:3,28 --> 0:11:5,4
spend ten or twenty thousand on a used one

376
0:11:5,4 --> 0:11:6,56
maybe just leave it be

377
0:11:6,56 --> 0:11:8,4
like how Brother Rong left his battery to go bad

378
0:11:8,4 --> 0:11:9,44
my goal is to let it go bad

379
0:11:9,44 --> 0:11:12,98
It's just so that I can have a license plate when I need one.

380
0:11:12,98 --> 0:11:14,46
So my goal is to prevent trouble.

381
0:11:14,46 --> 0:11:14,9
Right?

382
0:11:14,9 --> 0:11:17,32
My goal is to be indifferent when the time comes.

383
0:11:17,32 --> 0:11:19,38
I still have to pay for his insurance and parking fees.

384
0:11:19,38 --> 0:11:20,5
That just annoys me even more.

385
0:11:20,5 --> 0:11:21,78
Having a license plate would actually be more of a hassle.

386
0:11:21,78 --> 0:11:23,1
Because I don't have a place to use it.

387
0:11:23,1 --> 0:11:24,66
I'm doing fine with my electric vehicle now.

388
0:11:24,66 --> 0:11:26,0
I don't even need a motorcycle.

389
0:11:26,0 --> 0:11:28,12
I just have a few hundred meters to go every day right from my doorstep.

390
0:11:28,12 --> 0:11:30,15
A single charge lasts me a whole month.

391
0:11:30,15 --> 0:11:31,25
Why would I need to refuel?

392
0:11:31,25 --> 0:11:32,69
I’d have to drive all the way out of the Third Ring Road to refuel.

393
0:11:32,69 --> 0:11:35,23
And risk getting points on my license from the police.

394
0:11:35,23 --> 0:11:37,29
It’s a 200 yuan fine and one point deduction for breaking the driving restrictions.

395
0:11:37,29 --> 0:11:38,35
Because I violate the driving restrictions.

396
0:11:38,35 --> 0:11:38,73
Right?

397
0:11:38,73 --> 0:11:40,75
I can't afford a 300,000 Beijing A license plate

398
0:11:40,75 --> 0:11:44,7
So you'll find that the more you possess

399
0:11:44,7 --> 0:11:45,39
the more you own

400
0:11:45,39 --> 0:11:47,7
the more burden you carry

401
0:11:47,7 --> 0:11:49,42
If I buy several apartments, I'd have to rent them out

402
0:11:49,42 --> 0:11:51,0
and deal with the hassle of renovations

403
0:11:51,0 --> 0:11:52,34
Buying a car means dealing with depreciation

404
0:11:52,34 --> 0:11:53,3
and worrying about rain damage

405
0:11:53,3 --> 0:11:54,76
and having to shield it from the sun

406
0:11:54,76 --> 0:11:56,18
I’m worried the summer heat might melt it.

407
0:11:56,18 --> 0:11:56,54
Right?

408
0:11:56,54 --> 0:11:58,11
What a hassle.

409
0:11:58,11 --> 0:11:59,51
And dealing with multiple wives,

410
0:11:59,51 --> 0:12:1,3
which one is going to get pregnant?

411
0:12:1,3 --> 0:12:2,59
Then they’ll come after you for child support.

412
0:12:2,59 --> 0:12:3,25
How much of a headache that would be.

413
0:12:3,25 --> 0:12:3,849
Right?

414
0:12:3,849 --> 0:12:6,109
Your garage is such a mess.

415
0:12:6,109 --> 0:12:7,689
Clothes for wearing and such

416
0:12:7,689 --> 0:12:8,569
Won't need them in a couple of days

417
0:12:8,569 --> 0:12:8,929
They're no longer useful

418
0:12:8,929 --> 0:12:10,49
So you might as well donate them, right?

419
0:12:10,49 --> 0:12:10,769
Or just throw them away

420
0:12:10,769 --> 0:12:11,569
You won't be seeing them anyway

421
0:12:11,569 --> 0:12:12,77
And they take up space

422
0:12:12,77 --> 0:12:15,82
And you end up buying bigger storage because of the clothes and shoes

423
0:12:15,82 --> 0:12:16,54
Isn't that so?

424
0:12:16,54 --> 0:12:18,46
It's just that why do you call it a big house?

425
0:12:18,46 --> 0:12:19,9
It's because you've bought so much stuff.

426
0:12:19,9 --> 0:12:21,6
But you've bought too many things.

427
0:12:21,6 --> 0:12:23,15
Look, I have six lighting kits now.

428
0:12:23,15 --> 0:12:25,7
I always only have one camera.

429
0:12:25,7 --> 0:12:26,19
But now I have a sports camera.

430
0:12:26,19 --> 0:12:28,46
Do you have two or are there four or five game consoles?

431
0:12:28,46 --> 0:12:29,54
I can handle what I'm playing now.

432
0:12:29,54 --> 0:12:31,6
How long has it been since I touched the Steam Deck?

433
0:12:31,6 --> 0:12:31,86
It would have been better to smoke.

434
0:12:31,86 --> 0:12:32,14
Right?

435
0:12:32,14 --> 0:12:33,98
How long has it been since I last used my Switch?

436
0:12:33,98 --> 0:12:36,43
I only went on business trips eight times this year, right?

437
0:12:36,43 --> 0:12:37,53
Only ten times.

438
0:12:37,53 --> 0:12:39,51
I don’t really have anywhere to use such things.

439
0:12:39,51 --> 0:12:41,29
There’s actually no use case for it.

440
0:12:41,29 --> 0:12:43,65
I spent a lot of money buying things.

441
0:12:43,65 --> 0:12:45,66
There’s really no use case for them at all.

442
0:12:45,66 --> 0:12:47,32
So you really got here

443
0:12:47,32 --> 0:12:48,62
The day you actually become a monk

444
0:12:48,62 --> 0:12:49,86
Or go and be a Taoist

445
0:12:49,86 --> 0:12:51,6
Or go and become a priest

446
0:12:51,6 --> 0:12:52,22
Or go and become a monk

447
0:12:52,22 --> 0:12:52,98
That's fine

448
0:12:52,98 --> 0:12:54,67
We'll handle it based on different religions

449
0:12:54,67 --> 0:12:56,15
We'll make sure everyone gets a fair share

450
0:12:56,15 --> 0:12:57,67
But it doesn't have any practical significance

451
0:12:57,67 --> 0:13:0,43
I mean, the wealth you possess in this world

452
0:13:0,43 --> 0:13:2,69
material wealth doesn't really have much meaning

453
0:13:2,69 --> 0:13:3,77
including false fame

454
0:13:3,77 --> 0:13:6,5
and even fame and success aren't that useful

455
0:13:6,5 --> 0:13:7,69
once you reach my age

456
0:13:7,69 --> 0:13:8,21
you'll see

457
0:13:8,21 --> 0:13:9,85
even though the young lady might be slightly frail

458
0:13:9,85 --> 0:13:11,15
your own health won't be as good either

459
0:13:11,15 --> 0:13:11,7
right?

460
0:13:11,7 --> 0:13:12,98
Positive people always move forward

461
0:13:12,98 --> 0:13:13,58
You move backward

462
0:13:13,58 --> 0:13:14,54
That makes a difference

463
0:13:14,54 --> 0:13:14,86
Right?

464
0:13:14,86 --> 0:13:17,41
So often, it's about the back-and-forth

465
0:13:17,41 --> 0:13:20,1
These things you argue over in your twenties and thirties

466
0:13:20,1 --> 0:13:21,54
You go all out

467
0:13:21,54 --> 0:13:22,58
You spend your youth

468
0:13:22,58 --> 0:13:24,34
You sacrifice your moral standards

469
0:13:24,34 --> 0:13:25,22
At the cost of health

470
0:13:25,22 --> 0:13:26,329
to get these things

471
0:13:26,329 --> 0:13:29,769
in the end, you're just a pile of garbage

472
0:13:29,769 --> 0:13:30,889
industrial waste

473
0:13:30,889 --> 0:13:32,15
e-waste

474
0:13:32,15 --> 0:13:33,21
cultural relics waste

475
0:13:33,21 --> 0:13:36,23
Look at what we use today, is any of it from the Ming and Qing dynasties?

476
0:13:36,23 --> 0:13:38,85
Did the wealth of ancient people flow down to today?

477
0:13:38,85 --> 0:13:42,15
Did the objects that ancient people were attached to survive to the present day?

478
0:13:42,15 --> 0:13:43,43
Apart from what's buried with them,

479
0:13:43,43 --> 0:13:44,71
is there anything else that can be dug up now?

480
0:13:44,71 --> 0:13:46,27
What else has been left behind?

481
0:13:46,27 --> 0:13:48,3
Wood and paper scraps,

482
0:13:48,3 --> 0:13:51,6
copper and iron pieces, what really proved useful?

483
0:13:51,6 --> 0:13:51,42
Right?

484
0:13:51,42 --> 0:13:53,52
So, a lot of things were actually useless.

485
0:13:53,52 --> 0:13:54,76
Wood rots,

486
0:13:54,76 --> 0:13:56,95
and stone and ash won't be taken away.

487
0:13:56,95 --> 0:13:58,67
The piece of cloth can catch fire.

488
0:13:58,67 --> 0:14:1,11
A piece of paper would turn to ashes in no time.

489
0:14:1,11 --> 0:14:2,5
So let me tell you,

490
0:14:2,5 --> 0:14:3,65
being attached to material wealth,

491
0:14:3,65 --> 0:14:4,91
being obsessed with consumption,

492
0:14:4,91 --> 0:14:6,53
being fixated on the economic cycle,

493
0:14:6,53 --> 0:14:8,25
actually doesn’t hold much significance.

494
0:14:8,25 --> 0:14:9,49
So everyone should understand,

495
0:14:12,91 --> 0:14:15,25
I’m not saying that we shouldn’t value fairness and justice.

496
0:14:15,25 --> 0:14:16,649
I'm not saying

497
0:14:16,649 --> 0:14:18,249
We shouldn't compete with the rich kids

498
0:14:18,249 --> 0:14:21,329
But I don't envy what they have

499
0:14:21,329 --> 0:14:23,99
I think what's most useful in life is

500
0:14:25,79 --> 0:14:26,55
What you have

501
0:14:26,55 --> 0:14:30,7
What truly contributes to the soul of human society

502
0:14:30,7 --> 0:14:31,4
That's what matters

503
0:14:31,4 --> 0:14:32,62
It influences people's thoughts

504
0:14:32,62 --> 0:14:34,76
And helps everyone find a clear path forward

505
0:14:34,76 --> 0:14:35,48
This is useful

506
0:14:35,48 --> 0:14:37,8
Leading the people to a well-off life

507
0:14:37,8 --> 0:14:39,29
This is really helpful

508
0:14:39,29 --> 0:14:40,17
Right?

509
0:14:40,17 --> 0:14:41,75
So these things

510
0:14:41,75 --> 0:14:42,97
Actually, speaking of it

511
0:14:45,41 --> 0:14:47,65
A profound philosophical idea

512
0:14:47,65 --> 0:14:50,47
Material things don't represent happiness

513
0:14:50,47 --> 0:14:53,17
Materialism is a corrupt aspect of capitalism

514
0:14:53,17 --> 0:14:55,43
What you have is pretty good

515
0:14:55,43 --> 0:14:56,27
it's about developing the economy

516
0:14:56,27 --> 0:14:57,17
but you need to understand

517
0:14:57,17 --> 0:14:59,63
material possession itself and spiritual cultivation

518
0:14:59,63 --> 0:15:0,95
can't be equated

519
0:15:0,95 --> 0:15:1,79
so to speak

520
0:15:1,79 --> 0:15:5,6
although we are now much more materially affluent

521
0:15:5,6 --> 0:15:6,12
if you compare it to before the liberation

522
0:15:6,12 --> 0:15:8,1
the abundance now is certainly much greater

523
0:15:8,1 --> 0:15:9,12
We have all these things now

524
0:15:9,12 --> 0:15:11,8
You can see that this camera costs me a little over 10,000 yuan

525
0:15:11,8 --> 0:15:14,75
Is it not true that my TV and gaming console cost over 10,000 yuan?

526
0:15:14,75 --> 0:15:16,73
And the computer adds up to over 10,000 yuan as well

527
0:15:16,73 --> 0:15:17,77
If you think about it like in the past

528
0:15:17,77 --> 0:15:19,13
That would have made you a ten-thousand-yuan household months earlier

529
0:15:19,13 --> 0:15:20,16
You know what I mean?

530
0:15:20,16 --> 0:15:21,8
But no matter what

531
0:15:21,8 --> 0:15:21,96
Considering that era

532
0:15:21,96 --> 0:15:23,36
There's no way you could have something this good

533
0:15:23,36 --> 0:15:24,44
That was still a film camera

534
0:15:24,44 --> 0:15:26,28
Back then, TVs were so small

535
0:15:26,28 --> 0:15:27,4
We had computers back then

536
0:15:27,4 --> 0:15:28,4
What about phones?

537
0:15:28,4 --> 0:15:28,42
No, we didn't

538
0:15:28,42 --> 0:15:30,64
So in terms of our actual daily lives

539
0:15:30,64 --> 0:15:32,12
Things have become much more convenient

540
0:15:32,12 --> 0:15:34,29
The internet 20 years ago couldn't even be used for ordering food

541
0:15:34,29 --> 0:15:35,61
Shopping can also be quite a hassle

542
0:15:35,61 --> 0:15:38,1
and it even requires spending credit points or something like that

543
0:15:38,1 --> 0:15:39,57
you have to exchange money for credit points first

544
0:15:39,57 --> 0:15:40,29
which is quite troublesome

545
0:15:40,29 --> 0:15:42,3
and there’s no electronic online payment system

546
0:15:42,3 --> 0:15:43,95
so when it comes to many things today

547
0:15:43,95 --> 0:15:45,83
in many aspects, actually

548
0:15:45,83 --> 0:15:49,5
the gap between developed countries and the wealthy has been narrowed

549
0:15:49,5 --> 0:15:51,58
some services they used to have

550
0:15:51,58 --> 0:15:53,28
Just like this Didi ride-hailing service

551
0:15:53,28 --> 0:15:55,74
It’s a service only Freemasons have

552
0:15:55,74 --> 0:15:57,9
They have their own special sedan cars

553
0:15:57,9 --> 0:16:0,58
Outside the scope of regular taxis

554
0:16:0,58 --> 0:16:1,74
He also uses member services

555
0:16:1,74 --> 0:16:3,52
But now everyone has it

556
0:16:3,52 --> 0:16:6,53
The swallows that once nested in the halls of the noble Wang and Xie now fly into the homes of common people

557
0:16:6,53 --> 0:16:7,73
At least until today

558
0:16:7,73 --> 0:16:9,25
Do you really want to starve to death?

559
0:16:9,25 --> 0:16:9,85
In The New China

560
0:16:9,85 --> 0:16:10,69
Do you want to starve to death?

561
0:16:10,69 --> 0:16:12,9
That’s not an easy thing to do

562
0:16:12,9 --> 0:16:12,85
It’s extremely difficult

563
0:16:12,85 --> 0:16:14,31
If you say everyone is broke

564
0:16:14,31 --> 0:16:16,75
It might be possible, but if you say everyone is hungry

565
0:16:16,75 --> 0:16:17,99
You can beg for food on the streets

566
0:16:17,99 --> 0:16:18,95
And they’ll feed you until you’re full

567
0:16:18,95 --> 0:16:20,4
That’s how it is

568
0:16:20,4 --> 0:16:22,6
So when we talk about today

569
0:16:22,6 --> 0:16:24,7
A lot of things don’t actually matter

570
0:16:24,7 --> 0:16:26,65
So there’s no need to compete with them

571
0:16:26,65 --> 0:16:27,89
If they don’t want to compete, let them be

572
0:16:27,89 --> 0:16:29,13
They occupy those positions

573
0:16:29,13 --> 0:16:30,19
If they occupy them, so be it

574
0:16:30,19 --> 0:16:31,65
They won’t stay there for long anyway

575
0:16:31,65 --> 0:16:32,31
Right?

576
0:16:32,31 --> 0:16:33,67
Truly talented people

577
0:16:33,67 --> 0:16:36,63
Truly capable people will still hold their ground in the hospital

578
0:16:36,63 --> 0:16:38,839
So we need to find our own place

579
0:16:38,839 --> 0:16:40,819
Even though our current abilities are small

580
0:16:40,819 --> 0:16:42,679
We are just ordinary young people now

581
0:16:42,679 --> 0:16:45,11
But remember, three pawns can force the king

582
0:16:45,11 --> 0:16:47,3
Accumulate the victories of small pawns

583
0:16:47,3 --> 0:16:49,21
Small pawns working together

584
0:16:49,21 --> 0:16:50,63
Can always make a big difference

585
0:16:50,63 --> 0:16:52,36
Don’t think you don’t have the major pieces

586
0:16:52,36 --> 0:16:53,96
You don’t have a Maserati

587
0:16:53,96 --> 0:16:55,57
Maybe you don’t have much

588
0:16:55,57 --> 0:16:58,49
Kurize might not have a BMW motorcycle

589
0:16:58,49 --> 0:16:59,69
Maybe you don’t have a cannon

590
0:16:59,69 --> 0:17:1,37
But I might just be a small cannon

591
0:17:1,37 --> 0:17:2,45
Maybe I don’t have a big cannon

592
0:17:2,45 --> 0:17:4,77
But we can still live a wonderful life

593
0:17:4,77 --> 0:17:5,73
Without letting down the people

594
0:17:5,73 --> 0:17:6,57
Without letting down the country

595
0:17:6,57 --> 0:17:7,67
There’s absolutely no problem

596
0:17:7,67 --> 0:17:11,15
So many things are just material wealth

597
0:17:11,15 --> 0:17:12,71
Those high officials in the Ming and Qing dynasties

598
0:17:12,71 --> 0:17:14,23
How many were there in Beijing?

599
0:17:14,23 --> 0:17:16,19
How many are left now?

600
0:17:16,19 --> 0:17:16,969
Right?

601
0:17:16,969 --> 0:17:18,409
Just those temples and such

602
0:17:18,409 --> 0:17:19,469
The city walls were left

603
0:17:19,469 --> 0:17:21,369
The gardens were left

604
0:17:21,369 --> 0:17:23,7
But didn’t everything else disappear?

605
0:17:23,7 --> 0:17:25,16
Didn’t they all sink to the bottom of the sea?

606
0:17:25,16 --> 0:17:26,42
Didn’t they all get buried in the yellow earth?

607
0:17:26,42 --> 0:17:28,3
So don’t be attached to material wealth

608
0:17:28,3 --> 0:17:30,4
Build up your spiritual cultivation

609
0:17:30,4 --> 0:17:32,5
Even though we might be nothing now

610
0:17:32,5 --> 0:17:35,6
One day we can soar to the sky

611
0:17:35,6 --> 0:17:36,86
And make contributions to the people
