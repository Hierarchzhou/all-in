0:0:0,18 --> 0:0:0,66
Hello everyone

2
0:0:0,66 --> 0:0:2,2
Just chatting after waking up in the morning

3
0:0:2,2 --> 0:0:4,36
Ah, recently been taking care of the kids

4
0:0:4,36 --> 0:0:6,24
So the updates have been a bit slower

5
0:0:6,24 --> 0:0:10,5
Lately, I've been feeling extremely tired

6
0:0:10,5 --> 0:0:12,28
It might be related to the medication

7
0:0:12,28 --> 0:0:15,84
Recently, it's the toughest allergy season of the year

8
0:0:15,84 --> 0:0:18,24
So on Qixi, I was planning to update

9
0:0:18,24 --> 0:0:19,26
But it didn't happen

10
0:0:19,26 --> 0:0:20,56
Plus, I've been taking care of the kids these past couple of days

11
0:0:20,56 --> 0:0:22,16
So that's why I'm updating today

12
0:0:22,16 --> 0:0:23,16
That's not important though

13
0:0:23,16 --> 0:0:24,4
My second book

14
0:0:24,4 --> 0:0:25,84
Is currently in the writing process

15
0:0:25,84 --> 0:0:27,72
Actually, I submitted the manuscript a while ago

16
0:0:27,72 --> 0:0:32,4
But to be honest, I wasn't really satisfied with most of the content

17
0:0:32,4 --> 0:0:34,0
So I rewrote it again

18
0:0:34,0 --> 0:0:36,23
Now it's essentially the third version

19
0:0:36,23 --> 0:0:37,59
For the third edition,

20
0:0:37,59 --> 0:0:41,35
most of the content is actually different from before.

21
0:0:41,35 --> 0:0:44,53
As you all know, my first book was quite conservative,

22
0:0:44,53 --> 0:0:46,31
due to the need for approval at that time,

23
0:0:46,31 --> 0:0:47,65
I wrote in a rather conservative manner,

24
0:0:47,65 --> 0:0:48,98
and included a lot of content,

25
0:0:48,98 --> 0:0:50,12
it was, how should I put it,

26
0:0:50,12 --> 0:0:51,28
very watertight,

27
0:0:51,28 --> 0:0:54,88
which isn't really my natural way of speaking or writing.

28
0:0:54,88 --> 0:0:57,64
I will let loose completely in my second book.

29
0:0:57,64 --> 0:0:59,62
So it has great value as a favorite.

30
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:3,68
Uh, I mentioned in the last preview.

31
0:1:3,68 --> 0:1:7,52
I originally said this episode would be about the Qixi Festival.

32
0:1:7,52 --> 0:1:13,9
But actually, this episode will still talk about love.

33
0:1:13,289 --> 0:1:15,129
When discussing love,

34
0:1:15,129 --> 0:1:17,269
I want to start by sharing a viewpoint with everyone.

35
0:1:17,269 --> 0:1:18,78
My perspective is,

36
0:1:18,78 --> 0:1:21,94
No matter what the outcome of your life turns out to be.

37
0:1:21,94 --> 0:1:23,86
The lifestyle you choose

38
0:1:23,86 --> 0:1:24,9
How would you explain it?

39
0:1:24,9 --> 0:1:25,979
Be at peace with yourself

40
0:1:25,979 --> 0:1:28,759
Don’t make it out to be a big deal

41
0:1:28,759 --> 0:1:33,13
The original purpose of creating these holidays

42
0:1:33,13 --> 0:1:34,97
Whether it’s based on mythology

43
0:1:34,97 --> 0:1:36,43
Or historical anecdotes

44
0:1:36,43 --> 0:1:38,999
Take Saint Valentine, for instance

45
0:1:38,999 --> 0:1:41,699
Who stood up for young people in Rome

46
0:1:41,699 --> 0:1:44,47
To save this young couple, they sacrificed themselves

47
0:1:44,47 --> 0:1:47,77
Or is it the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl crossing the magpie bridge

48
0:1:47,77 --> 0:1:48,67
No matter what

49
0:1:48,67 --> 0:1:50,7
The East has its own Valentine's Day

50
0:1:50,7 --> 0:1:51,58
The West has its own Valentine's Day

51
0:1:51,58 --> 0:1:52,66
Some people say

52
0:1:52,66 --> 0:1:54,38
Valentine's Day should be spent with one's lover

53
0:1:54,38 --> 0:1:56,1
Why should it be spent with one's wife

54
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:59,76
We shouldn't promote such unhealthy values

55
0:1:59,76 --> 0:2:0,76
Sure, let's talk about it.

56
0:2:0,76 --> 0:2:4,88
First, let's discuss why this thing exists.

57
0:2:4,88 --> 0:2:7,51
Why do people fall in love?

58
0:2:7,51 --> 0:2:10,71
It's a form of genetic selection.

59
0:2:10,71 --> 0:2:14,75
Because genes need to constantly evolve.

60
0:2:14,75 --> 0:2:16,48
And be passed down.

61
0:2:16,48 --> 0:2:18,8
It's actually the selfish gene.

62
0:2:18,8 --> 0:2:19,64
If you've read the book, you'll know.

63
0:2:19,64 --> 0:2:20,92
Humans are merely vehicles for genes.

64
0:2:20,92 --> 0:2:22,98
It's a tool for replicating oneself.

65
0:2:22,98 --> 0:2:25,31
That's one perspective.

66
0:2:25,31 --> 0:2:29,1
As you all know, I tend to advocate for, how should I put it,

67
0:2:29,1 --> 0:2:32,76
utilitarian or realistic thinking.

68
0:2:32,76 --> 0:2:34,42
Machiavelli primarily discussed these ideas.

69
0:2:34,42 --> 0:2:36,81
But in terms of my personal conduct,

70
0:2:36,81 --> 0:2:39,85
I have already transcended the utilitarian phase.

71
0:2:39,85 --> 0:2:43,9
Indeed, love does have its pragmatic side.

72
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:46,6
It involves what you might call a strong alliance, right?

73
0:2:46,6 --> 0:2:47,6
It's about being well-matched.

74
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:48,5
There is this aspect.

75
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:52,44
But love itself, no matter how old you are,

76
0:2:52,44 --> 0:2:55,2
you shouldn't turn your back on it.

77
0:2:55,2 --> 0:2:58,87
That is, it's something grand and sacred.

78
0:2:58,87 --> 0:3:1,55
This is the core idea of this episode.

79
0:3:1,55 --> 0:3:4,75
How should we approach the choices in love?

80
0:3:4,75 --> 0:3:6,63
Because when we are young,

81
0:3:6,63 --> 0:3:8,5
Take me, for example.

82
0:3:8,5 --> 0:3:9,18
When I was six or seven

83
0:3:9,18 --> 0:3:12,22
I already had someone I liked back then

84
0:3:12,22 --> 0:3:12,54
Right?

85
0:3:12,54 --> 0:3:14,93
There was that innocent feeling of youth

86
0:3:14,93 --> 0:3:18,95
Actually, from elementary school to junior and senior high school

87
0:3:18,95 --> 0:3:20,16
The people I liked

88
0:3:20,16 --> 0:3:22,6
I still have a soft spot for them

89
0:3:22,6 --> 0:3:23,79
I still admire them

90
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:27,57
But it doesn't mean that everyone you like should end up together

91
0:3:27,57 --> 0:3:29,31
And often when we talk about it

92
0:3:29,31 --> 0:3:32,6
we mention the process of courtship

93
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:34,66
which involves the exchange of interests among adults

94
0:3:34,66 --> 0:3:36,8
and it also involves issues of sexuality

95
0:3:36,8 --> 0:3:41,68
So, I often see sex and love as two separate things

96
0:3:41,68 --> 0:3:43,36
Someone who is sexually attractive

97
0:3:43,36 --> 0:3:45,76
may not necessarily evoke strong feelings between you two

98
0:3:45,76 --> 0:3:48,1
This is an inequality in the adult world

99
0:3:48,1 --> 0:3:52,96
Many people tend to consider affection and love together

100
0:3:52,96 --> 0:3:55,24
Some people can separate things and consider them individually.

101
0:3:55,24 --> 0:3:57,329
I belong to the category of those who can separate things.

102
0:3:57,329 --> 0:4:1,649
But at its core, it's impossible for these things to be completely separated.

103
0:4:1,649 --> 0:4:3,409
If you don't have any good feelings towards a person,

104
0:4:3,409 --> 0:4:4,629
you really don't.

105
0:4:4,629 --> 0:4:6,769
This is what I think is the biggest difference between men and women.

106
0:4:6,769 --> 0:4:10,2
Men can completely detach emotionally,

107
0:4:10,2 --> 0:4:12,32
and pursue someone solely for sexual reasons,

108
0:4:12,32 --> 0:4:14,3
or care about someone in that way.

109
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:15,55
I think girls, in this aspect,

110
0:4:15,55 --> 0:4:18,13
apart from a very few exceptions,

111
0:4:18,45 --> 0:4:21,65
most people still have some liking for this,

112
0:4:21,65 --> 0:4:22,17
how should I put it,

113
0:4:22,17 --> 0:4:24,15
this partner, this significant other,

114
0:4:24,15 --> 0:4:25,93
it's impossible to have absolutely no interest at all,

115
0:4:25,93 --> 0:4:27,72
otherwise, they wouldn't be able to go through with it,

116
0:4:27,72 --> 0:4:32,8
but I personally think, no matter how much we discuss this,

117
0:4:32,8 --> 0:4:34,85
let's face it, this is a form of consumerist behavior.

118
0:4:34,85 --> 0:4:36,25
To lure a man

119
0:4:36,25 --> 0:4:37,17
No matter who it is

120
0:4:37,17 --> 0:4:38,63
You should spend some money

121
0:4:38,63 --> 0:4:40,13
To satisfy the opposite sex

122
0:4:40,13 --> 0:4:42,34
This is also a form of societal guidance

123
0:4:42,34 --> 0:4:44,26
This is indeed the case

124
0:4:44,26 --> 0:4:45,38
He has this characteristic

125
0:4:45,38 --> 0:4:45,78
Right?

126
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:47,7
Because your country and society are not developing

127
0:4:47,7 --> 0:4:49,62
No one is reproducing to increase the population.

128
0:4:49,62 --> 0:4:51,18
The community would die out, wouldn't it?

129
0:4:51,18 --> 0:4:51,76
Right?

130
0:4:51,76 --> 0:4:54,5
But from the perspective of personal aspirations,

131
0:4:54,5 --> 0:4:58,48
I've always been a staunch advocate of single life.

132
0:4:58,48 --> 0:5:0,74
This idea of being single and independent.

133
0:5:0,74 --> 0:5:3,1
It wasn't something I had from the beginning,

134
0:5:3,1 --> 0:5:6,53
nor did it come from not being able to find a partner.

135
0:5:6,53 --> 0:5:8,65
It came from a place of personal choice.

136
0:5:8,65 --> 0:5:12,69
Or, the attitude one has towards life or towards personal cultivation.

137
0:5:12,69 --> 0:5:16,14
I believe that a person can maintain a single status.

138
0:5:16,14 --> 0:5:18,64
Sometimes you might travel with others,

139
0:5:18,64 --> 0:5:20,96
for a period or work together with someone,

140
0:5:20,96 --> 0:5:22,4
or be with someone,

141
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:25,0
but these situations are not permanent states.

142
0:5:25,0 --> 0:5:26,48
I am against marriage.

143
0:5:26,48 --> 0:5:28,9
I have no interest in marriage at all.

144
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:30,4
You could say, none whatsoever.

145
0:5:30,4 --> 0:5:32,94
Actually, my marriage was also a result of a momentary impulse.

146
0:5:32,94 --> 0:5:36,25
Actually, I've always been a person who doesn't believe in marriage.

147
0:5:36,25 --> 0:5:39,13
Because I think love should be a part of life,

148
0:5:39,13 --> 0:5:42,51
but having a family doesn't necessarily mean you need to get married.

149
0:5:42,51 --> 0:5:45,1
Marriage isn't always a must.

150
0:5:45,1 --> 0:5:46,27
That's how I see it.

151
0:5:46,27 --> 0:5:49,51
And that's how I've consistently lived my life.

152
0:5:49,51 --> 0:5:55,75
But I still believe that one of the most precious things in this world might be the kind of relationship young people have,

153
0:5:55,75 --> 0:5:57,28
the childhood sweethearts.

154
0:5:57,28 --> 0:5:59,56
Those impulsive couples on campus

155
0:5:59,56 --> 0:6:0,62
are really great

156
0:6:0,62 --> 0:6:3,96
Although I always say that couples shouldn't flaunt their affection

157
0:6:3,96 --> 0:6:5,9
Flaunting affection leads to a quick breakup

158
0:6:5,9 --> 0:6:7,55
Don't make us single people feel left out

159
0:6:7,55 --> 0:6:8,79
But to be honest

160
0:6:8,79 --> 0:6:11,1
When I see those couples in my social circle

161
0:6:11,1 --> 0:6:12,19
whether they are followers

162
0:6:12,19 --> 0:6:14,19
or colleagues and classmates

163
0:6:14,19 --> 0:6:17,3
I tend to bless people from the heart

164
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:18,47
there's no need to curse them

165
0:6:18,47 --> 0:6:19,2
right?

166
0:6:19,2 --> 0:6:19,8
it's quite normal

167
0:6:19,8 --> 0:6:21,55
there's genuine affection in the world

168
0:6:21,55 --> 0:6:24,71
when someone chooses to be with the one they love

169
0:6:24,71 --> 0:6:26,71
and both are committed to each other

170
0:6:26,71 --> 0:6:28,21
to build a family together

171
0:6:28,21 --> 0:6:31,3
that's a truly beautiful thing

172
0:6:31,3 --> 0:6:33,87
But if you don’t have the chance to start a family

173
0:6:33,87 --> 0:6:35,85
or haven’t found your soulmate

174
0:6:35,85 --> 0:6:38,9
and remain single or involuntarily single

175
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:41,0
don’t feel too down about it

176
0:6:41,0 --> 0:6:42,93
because in this world

177
0:6:42,93 --> 0:6:44,43
with the vastness of the universe

178
0:6:44,43 --> 0:6:46,41
there are many pursuits to follow

179
0:6:46,41 --> 0:6:49,44
and so much to explore

180
0:6:49,44 --> 0:6:52,16
as you can see, I’m not in a state of freedom myself

181
0:6:52,16 --> 0:6:53,3
It's because I have kids

182
0:6:53,3 --> 0:6:54,94
so I have to spend time with them every week

183
0:6:54,94 --> 0:6:55,8
and because I have parents

184
0:6:55,8 --> 0:6:57,6
you know, parents shouldn't travel far when they're around

185
0:6:57,6 --> 0:6:57,44
right?

186
0:6:57,44 --> 0:6:58,69
and they're not in the best health

187
0:6:58,69 --> 0:7:0,57
so you can't go too far away

188
0:7:0,57 --> 0:7:3,39
I can only stay at a place for up to two weeks

189
0:7:3,39 --> 0:7:4,679
if I want to go abroad

190
0:7:4,679 --> 0:7:5,799
It's no more than a month.

191
0:7:5,799 --> 0:7:8,19
So, we need to hurry back as soon as possible.

192
0:7:8,19 --> 0:7:8,399
Why?

193
0:7:8,399 --> 0:7:12,89
Because this is the time when your parents need you the most in their entire lives.

194
0:7:12,89 --> 0:7:14,73
For children, before the age of 12,

195
0:7:14,73 --> 0:7:16,11
or even before 16,

196
0:7:16,11 --> 0:7:19,62
it's a crucial period for building a father-son relationship.

197
0:7:19,62 --> 0:7:21,46
This is when they need you the most.

198
0:7:21,46 --> 0:7:23,789
After 16 to 18 years old,

199
0:7:23,789 --> 0:7:25,9
Or when the parents are really old

200
0:7:25,9 --> 0:7:27,22
You have to find someone to take care of them

201
0:7:27,22 --> 0:7:28,6
Once they're in a nursing home

202
0:7:28,6 --> 0:7:30,1
It doesn't really concern you anymore

203
0:7:30,1 --> 0:7:30,46
Right?

204
0:7:30,46 --> 0:7:31,46
In that case

205
0:7:31,46 --> 0:7:34,98
The time you can help out will be less

206
0:7:34,98 --> 0:7:36,6
I'm not saying

207
0:7:36,6 --> 0:7:38,2
You shouldn't take care of your parents at that time

208
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:43,19
That's when healthcare and caregiving professionals become even more important.

209
0:7:43,19 --> 0:7:45,77
Nowadays, parents are in their sixties or early seventies.

210
0:7:45,77 --> 0:7:48,0
They haven’t reached their late seventies or eighties yet.

211
0:7:48,0 --> 0:7:50,16
This is the time when you should be there for your parents.

212
0:7:50,16 --> 0:7:52,28
Although their health may not be great,

213
0:7:52,28 --> 0:7:54,79
it’s still okay to spend time with them, chat, and talk.

214
0:7:54,79 --> 0:7:55,71
Take them on trips,

215
0:7:55,71 --> 0:7:58,13
and share these moments together.

216
0:7:58,13 --> 0:7:59,1
I think that’s wonderful.

217
0:7:59,1 --> 0:8:0,9
But if you get married,

218
0:8:0,9 --> 0:8:1,21
you won't be able to do that.

219
0:8:1,21 --> 0:8:1,85
You will get married,

220
0:8:1,85 --> 0:8:2,53
no matter what,

221
0:8:2,53 --> 0:8:3,75
you will start a new family.

222
0:8:3,75 --> 0:8:5,47
There are people who live with their parents,

223
0:8:5,47 --> 0:8:7,43
but he will definitely live with one set of parents,

224
0:8:7,43 --> 0:8:9,19
and certainly not with both sets of parents.

225
0:8:9,19 --> 0:8:12,52
So, in many cases, I've heard about people opting for 'marriage pooling' now.

226
0:8:12,52 --> 0:8:13,16
There's the practice of walking marriage

227
0:8:13,16 --> 0:8:14,74
where you return to your own family on weekends

228
0:8:14,74 --> 0:8:16,4
and live in your small family during the week

229
0:8:16,4 --> 0:8:17,28
I think this is quite good

230
0:8:17,28 --> 0:8:19,35
But for those of us who are divorced and have children

231
0:8:19,35 --> 0:8:21,67
I can spend time with my parents on a regular basis

232
0:8:21,67 --> 0:8:22,67
I feel very happy

233
0:8:22,67 --> 0:8:24,19
I've had several times in the past

234
0:8:24,19 --> 0:8:27,179
and even now, I still think about moving out

235
0:8:27,179 --> 0:8:28,619
I have a small place of my own

236
0:8:28,619 --> 0:8:29,999
I set up another broadband connection myself

237
0:8:29,999 --> 0:8:31,159
I got another computer for myself

238
0:8:31,159 --> 0:8:33,569
Isn't it great to do whatever I want in my own space?

239
0:8:33,569 --> 0:8:35,269
But I always feel that

240
0:8:35,269 --> 0:8:36,789
with my parents still around

241
0:8:36,789 --> 0:8:40,21
I will be living alone for a long time

242
0:8:40,21 --> 0:8:41,63
the kids grow up

243
0:8:41,63 --> 0:8:42,49
she leaves me

244
0:8:42,49 --> 0:8:45,3
Or he lives with his mother.

245
0:8:45,3 --> 0:8:47,31
Isn't it that everyone has their own life?

246
0:8:47,31 --> 0:8:49,15
His parents passed away back then.

247
0:8:49,15 --> 0:8:49,99
He's no longer around.

248
0:8:49,99 --> 0:8:54,939
I have decades of solitude to enjoy in the future.

249
0:8:54,939 --> 0:8:58,79
So I don't need to rush at this moment.

250
0:8:58,79 --> 0:9:1,279
When I was young, I thought I went through a lot for love.

251
0:9:1,279 --> 0:9:3,779
Or rather, for emotions, I took many detours.

252
0:9:3,779 --> 0:9:7,92
But looking back now, those so-called detours were actually smooth paths.

253
0:9:7,95 --> 0:9:10,7
It's all worth it.

254
0:9:10,55 --> 0:9:15,64
Whether you achieve or don't achieve your ideal goal,

255
0:9:15,96 --> 0:9:17,8
you shouldn't be sad.

256
0:9:17,8 --> 0:9:19,8
Why shouldn't you be sad?

257
0:9:19,8 --> 0:9:22,24
Because the person you like changes over time.

258
0:9:22,24 --> 0:9:24,18
And the person you like,

259
0:9:24,18 --> 0:9:27,47
is not just the person themselves,

260
0:9:27,47 --> 0:9:32,19
but what they represent—a set of values and an impression you project onto them.

261
0:9:32,19 --> 0:9:34,63
In fact, you are gradually perfecting the image of the other person.

262
0:9:34,63 --> 0:9:35,87
Including love

263
0:9:35,87 --> 0:9:36,59
Any kind of love

264
0:9:36,59 --> 0:9:37,83
Or with your wife

265
0:9:37,83 --> 0:9:39,31
During your honeymoon phase

266
0:9:39,31 --> 0:9:41,23
You might think she's perfect

267
0:9:41,23 --> 0:9:42,85
Your husband seems perfect too

268
0:9:42,85 --> 0:9:44,49
The same goes for new relationships

269
0:9:44,49 --> 0:9:46,11
The feeling is really great

270
0:9:46,11 --> 0:9:47,91
But as time goes on

271
0:9:47,91 --> 0:9:49,21
When it comes to human beings,

272
0:9:49,21 --> 0:9:51,4
they tend to gradually grow tired of someone,

273
0:9:51,4 --> 0:9:52,36
get used to someone,

274
0:9:52,36 --> 0:9:53,8
over time,

275
0:9:53,8 --> 0:9:55,93
you start to feel a sense of aversion towards them,

276
0:9:55,93 --> 0:9:58,73
and begin to develop a sense of novelty with a new person,

277
0:9:58,73 --> 0:10:0,61
people are always inclined to seek new things and get tired of old ones,

278
0:10:0,61 --> 0:10:2,5
there's nothing wrong with that,

279
0:10:2,5 --> 0:10:3,64
that's just how they're wired.

280
0:10:3,64 --> 0:10:5,28
Why did he encode it this way?

281
0:10:5,28 --> 0:10:6,66
Because it's the same old story.

282
0:10:6,66 --> 0:10:9,72
Genes need to have their own process of transmission.

283
0:10:9,72 --> 0:10:13,98
If you want to understand how reproduction, love, and sexuality work,

284
0:10:13,98 --> 0:10:16,46
this isn't just a matter of sociology.

285
0:10:16,46 --> 0:10:17,22
There's sociology,

286
0:10:17,22 --> 0:10:18,44
there's the sociology of sexuality,

287
0:10:18,44 --> 0:10:20,56
and there's also the field of anthropology.

288
0:10:20,56 --> 0:10:21,6
Right?

289
0:10:21,6 --> 0:10:22,4
How does a person survive?

290
0:10:22,4 --> 0:10:24,32
How do various species reproduce?

291
0:10:24,32 --> 0:10:25,74
How do they mate?

292
0:10:25,74 --> 0:10:27,37
How do new species emerge?

293
0:10:27,37 --> 0:10:30,85
There's a complex mechanism behind this.

294
0:10:30,85 --> 0:10:33,57
And it involves biology,

295
0:10:33,57 --> 0:10:34,62
as well as medicine,

296
0:10:34,62 --> 0:10:37,34
the hormones in your brain,

297
0:10:37,34 --> 0:10:38,3
how are they distributed?

298
0:10:38,3 --> 0:10:39,74
How are neurons distributed?

299
0:10:39,74 --> 0:10:41,0
What substances are secreted?

300
0:10:41,0 --> 0:10:43,76
How do dopamine and endorphins produce these substances?

301
0:10:43,76 --> 0:10:44,96
What's the deal with hormones?

302
0:10:44,96 --> 0:10:48,35
So these things are influenced by multiple factors.

303
0:10:48,35 --> 0:10:50,43
It's not just one or two simple factors.

304
0:10:50,43 --> 0:10:52,3
But for me,

305
0:10:52,3 --> 0:10:56,88
all of this is a kind of illusion.

306
0:10:56,88 --> 0:10:58,64
It's a delusion.

307
0:10:58,64 --> 0:11:1,36
It's not something tangible.

308
0:11:1,36 --> 0:11:4,3
But look at all the people I used to like.

309
0:11:4,3 --> 0:11:6,16
But when you bring it back to reality,

310
0:11:6,16 --> 0:11:8,53
they are just ordinary people.

311
0:11:8,53 --> 0:11:10,5
If you think about it carefully,

312
0:11:10,5 --> 0:11:11,33
spending your life with them,

313
0:11:11,33 --> 0:11:12,65
living together every day,

314
0:11:12,65 --> 0:11:13,37
sharing meals and burps,

315
0:11:13,37 --> 0:11:14,5
and all the other daily routines.

316
0:11:14,5 --> 0:11:17,16
These things might not look as aesthetically pleasing when placed together.

317
0:11:17,16 --> 0:11:19,87
A lot of things seem most appealing when they're just out of reach.

318
0:11:19,87 --> 0:11:21,1
They feel the most special then.

319
0:11:21,1 --> 0:11:22,3
But once you get what you want,

320
0:11:22,3 --> 0:11:24,47
whether it's taking the car out or bringing it home,

321
0:11:24,47 --> 0:11:26,43
you might get tired of it after a few days.

322
0:11:26,43 --> 0:11:27,91
Why do people sell used cars?

323
0:11:27,91 --> 0:11:30,76
It's often because they get tired of them after driving for a while.

324
0:11:30,76 --> 0:11:32,36
So, many times, that's just how it goes.

325
0:11:32,36 --> 0:11:35,709
So the state you once desperately wanted to achieve

326
0:11:35,709 --> 0:11:38,25
might just be a phase in your life

327
0:11:38,25 --> 0:11:39,97
and whether or not you enter this phase

328
0:11:39,97 --> 0:11:42,57
doesn't really have a significant impact on your future

329
0:11:42,57 --> 0:11:46,74
so I'm saying don't get too fixated on love

330
0:11:46,74 --> 0:11:49,42
fixating on a particular person or a certain idea

331
0:11:49,42 --> 0:11:51,62
or thinking you must be with someone

332
0:11:51,62 --> 0:11:54,51
or you must not be single

333
0:11:54,51 --> 0:11:56,23
you need to find a partner

334
0:11:56,23 --> 0:12:0,19
I think, as someone on a spiritual journey,

335
0:12:0,19 --> 0:12:5,4
the first thing is not to have any such constraints,

336
0:12:5,4 --> 0:12:8,53
my behavior in a certain place,

337
0:12:8,53 --> 0:12:11,77
if I were to find a girlfriend,

338
0:12:11,77 --> 0:12:13,13
for instance, get married or something,

339
0:12:13,13 --> 0:12:15,4
she would inevitably restrict me,

340
0:12:15,4 --> 0:12:16,84
her family,

341
0:12:16,84 --> 0:12:18,0
the place she’s from,

342
0:12:18,0 --> 0:12:18,76
her career

343
0:12:18,76 --> 0:12:20,1
His life plan

344
0:12:20,1 --> 0:12:22,52
is definitely, for me

345
0:12:22,52 --> 0:12:23,52
he needs to make some choices

346
0:12:23,52 --> 0:12:24,68
for him

347
0:12:24,68 --> 0:12:25,88
I also need to make some choices

348
0:12:25,88 --> 0:12:27,72
it's like being a couple

349
0:12:27,72 --> 0:12:31,58
you always have to give up part of your lifestyle and your dreams

350
0:12:31,58 --> 0:12:33,18
to build this family

351
0:12:33,18 --> 0:12:34,359
being together

352
0:12:34,359 --> 0:12:35,819
But in reality,

353
0:12:35,819 --> 0:12:39,119
when you actually take the road less traveled,

354
0:12:39,119 --> 0:12:40,499
you might end up regretting it.

355
0:12:40,499 --> 0:12:42,17
Life is just like that.

356
0:12:42,17 --> 0:12:45,29
So, for me personally,

357
0:12:45,29 --> 0:12:47,93
I need to be free.

358
0:12:47,93 --> 0:12:49,45
This is very important.

359
0:12:49,45 --> 0:12:50,51
Without freedom,

360
0:12:50,51 --> 0:12:52,47
many things lack a foundation.

361
0:12:52,47 --> 0:12:53,81
Wealth brings freedom

362
0:12:53,81 --> 0:12:54,17
Action

363
0:12:54,17 --> 0:12:55,37
brings freedom too

364
0:12:55,37 --> 0:12:57,31
You only have the freedom to move

365
0:12:57,31 --> 0:12:58,75
Action is what grants freedom

366
0:12:58,75 --> 0:12:59,95
Only action brings freedom

367
0:12:59,95 --> 0:13:1,31
Our endeavors can only thrive with freedom

368
0:13:1,31 --> 0:13:5,8
So no one should force me to stay in one place

369
0:13:5,8 --> 0:13:6,9
Or because of a mortgage

370
0:13:6,9 --> 0:13:7,92
That would be even more absurd.

371
0:13:7,92 --> 0:13:8,72
Or because of the house.

372
0:13:8,72 --> 0:13:10,89
Because of the car, it’s just absurd, you know.

373
0:13:10,89 --> 0:13:11,89
The child has no choice.

374
0:13:11,89 --> 0:13:13,11
The child can’t bear to part with it.

375
0:13:13,11 --> 0:13:15,0
Parents are born with it, right?

376
0:13:15,0 --> 0:13:15,32
Isn’t that right?

377
0:13:15,32 --> 0:13:16,5
This is a forced connection.

378
0:13:16,5 --> 0:13:19,74
So, in this case, it can’t be as strong.

379
0:13:19,74 --> 0:13:22,24
At the very least, I don’t want such reasons to hold me back

380
0:13:22,24 --> 0:13:24,36
As they say, where there’s a stepmother, there’s a stepfather

381
0:13:24,36 --> 0:13:25,0
Exactly

382
0:13:25,0 --> 0:13:26,2
Now that you have Guo Fenyang

383
0:13:26,2 --> 0:13:28,4
Your care for Guo Qilin naturally diminishes

384
0:13:28,4 --> 0:13:29,0
That’s right

385
0:13:29,0 --> 0:13:31,84
So, from the perspective of protecting a child

386
0:13:31,84 --> 0:13:33,73
I wouldn’t choose to remarry

387
0:13:33,73 --> 0:13:37,57
I even think that the benefits others could bring me are minimal

388
0:13:37,57 --> 0:13:40,28
And the burden others bring to me is significant.

389
0:13:40,28 --> 0:13:43,56
Many people do not contribute to my career.

390
0:13:43,56 --> 0:13:46,58
He just depletes my resources.

391
0:13:46,58 --> 0:13:49,17
And sex is just a fleeting moment.

392
0:13:49,17 --> 0:13:51,85
From a long-term perspective on life,

393
0:13:51,85 --> 0:13:54,38
Many people don't even catch my attention.

394
0:13:54,38 --> 0:13:56,64
He can't help me achieve any of my dreams.

395
0:13:56,64 --> 0:14:0,3
He can't help me fill the gaps in my family either.

396
0:14:0,3 --> 0:14:2,92
And I still have to allocate some of my time and energy.

397
0:14:2,92 --> 0:14:5,28
Money can't always be there to accompany someone.

398
0:14:5,28 --> 0:14:6,38
So, when we talk about it,

399
0:14:6,38 --> 0:14:10,26
We say that we are all wanderers in this world,

400
0:14:10,26 --> 0:14:12,18
Strangers meeting, why should we have met before?

401
0:14:12,18 --> 0:14:13,82
At every stage of life,

402
0:14:13,82 --> 0:14:15,93
What you want is different.

403
0:14:15,93 --> 0:14:19,55
But I always find that, whether I was in my teens,

404
0:14:19,55 --> 0:14:20,25
In my twenties,

405
0:14:20,25 --> 0:14:20,77
Or in my thirties,

406
0:14:20,77 --> 0:14:21,49
In my forties

407
0:14:21,49 --> 0:14:23,81
I pursued the same thing

408
0:14:23,81 --> 0:14:25,29
freedom

409
0:14:25,29 --> 0:14:27,5
freedom is crucial

410
0:14:27,5 --> 0:14:29,73
freedom doesn't mean I have to go somewhere

411
0:14:29,73 --> 0:14:30,95
sometimes staying in

412
0:14:30,95 --> 0:14:31,83
not replying to messages

413
0:14:31,83 --> 0:14:33,21
is also a form of freedom

414
0:14:33,21 --> 0:14:35,5
I really hate replying to others' messages

415
0:14:35,5 --> 0:14:37,9
I really hate calling people at fixed times

416
0:14:37,9 --> 0:14:39,51
It feels like punching a clock for a task

417
0:14:39,51 --> 0:14:42,51
I also hate when others interfere with how I spend my money

418
0:14:42,51 --> 0:14:43,43
or how I live my life

419
0:14:43,43 --> 0:14:44,67
or where I choose to live

420
0:14:44,67 --> 0:14:46,44
All these things just hold me back

421
0:14:46,44 --> 0:14:48,72
And the reason a place attracts me

422
0:14:48,72 --> 0:14:50,84
To put it bluntly, it’s because there are beautiful girls

423
0:14:50,84 --> 0:14:51,84
Young girls

424
0:14:51,84 --> 0:14:53,23
This place really draws me in.

425
0:14:53,23 --> 0:14:54,61
So, for me,

426
0:14:54,61 --> 0:14:56,69
I have a low need for pairing up with others,

427
0:14:56,69 --> 0:15:1,319
whether it's just companionship or becoming a couple.

428
0:15:1,319 --> 0:15:4,539
Most people don't know how to help me,

429
0:15:4,539 --> 0:15:7,69
and most people can't really help me either.

430
0:15:7,69 --> 0:15:8,85
Marrying a man,

431
0:15:8,85 --> 0:15:9,57
for clothes and food,

432
0:15:9,57 --> 0:15:12,51
he needs to find someone who can be a financial support.

433
0:15:12,51 --> 0:15:14,39
An ATM that lets you spend money

434
0:15:14,39 --> 0:15:16,91
Of course, this has a bit of a derogatory tone

435
0:15:16,91 --> 0:15:18,19
But in reality

436
0:15:18,19 --> 0:15:19,11
When you start a family

437
0:15:19,11 --> 0:15:20,65
It does require a significant amount of material resources

438
0:15:20,65 --> 0:15:21,23
That's just how it is

439
0:15:21,23 --> 0:15:21,78
Right?

440
0:15:21,78 --> 0:15:23,14
So for me

441
0:15:23,14 --> 0:15:24,6
In this aspect

442
0:15:24,6 --> 0:15:26,7
The desire for the opposite sex is gradually decreasing.

443
0:15:26,7 --> 0:15:30,21
So, over time, the importance of love itself isn't as highly regarded.

444
0:15:30,21 --> 0:15:35,92
However, this shouldn't negate the role of love in human society.

445
0:15:35,92 --> 0:15:38,68
If one can find a suitable partner,

446
0:15:38,68 --> 0:15:42,8
finding a soulmate is indeed a wonderful thing.

447
0:15:42,8 --> 0:15:44,379
There are many aspects of life,

448
0:15:44,379 --> 0:15:45,679
which one doesn't want to face alone.

449
0:15:45,679 --> 0:15:47,73
For instance, hunger,

450
0:15:47,73 --> 0:15:49,87
illness, and death.

451
0:15:52,93 --> 0:15:54,13
It's good to spend some money on your partner.

452
0:15:54,13 --> 0:15:56,97
Sharing your life with them is a wonderful thing.

453
0:15:56,97 --> 0:15:58,99
But for me,

454
0:15:58,99 --> 0:16:0,11
it's still the same principle,

455
0:16:0,11 --> 0:16:1,83
as someone on a spiritual path,

456
0:16:1,83 --> 0:16:3,59
there are many lessons to learn in this life,

457
0:16:3,59 --> 0:16:5,55
many tasks to accomplish.

458
0:16:5,55 --> 0:16:8,67
Practicing in the secular world has its own set of challenges.

459
0:16:8,67 --> 0:16:10,19
But speaking for myself,

460
0:16:10,19 --> 0:16:12,67
The most crucial thing is the freedom to migrate.

461
0:16:12,67 --> 0:16:15,43
If you get married, you can't achieve this.

462
0:16:15,43 --> 0:16:16,97
No matter who you marry,

463
0:16:16,97 --> 0:16:18,55
they will have parents,

464
0:16:18,55 --> 0:16:21,23
and things they are emotionally attached to,

465
0:16:21,23 --> 0:16:22,17
they will have a career,

466
0:16:22,17 --> 0:16:23,81
a source of their livelihood,

467
0:16:23,81 --> 0:16:24,91
a place to live,

468
0:16:24,91 --> 0:16:25,45
a home to stay in.

469
0:16:25,45 --> 0:16:27,16
These are all issues.

470
0:16:27,16 --> 0:16:28,9
So once you get a wife,

471
0:16:28,9 --> 0:16:30,76
once you have a steady girlfriend,

472
0:16:30,76 --> 0:16:33,76
there will be a lot of troubles waiting for you.

473
0:16:33,76 --> 0:16:35,16
So for me,

474
0:16:35,16 --> 0:16:38,4
being single doesn't mean I can be with someone today

475
0:16:38,4 --> 0:16:40,38
and with someone else tomorrow without any moral burden.

476
0:16:40,38 --> 0:16:41,54
That's not what it means.

477
0:16:41,54 --> 0:16:46,53
It means that being single is about maintaining an independent life state.

478
0:16:46,53 --> 0:16:48,93
It's not that there's absolutely no girlfriend at all

479
0:16:48,93 --> 0:16:50,37
But relatively speaking

480
0:16:50,37 --> 0:16:51,69
We don't get entangled with each other

481
0:16:51,69 --> 0:16:54,21
We don't interfere with each other's lifestyle

482
0:16:54,21 --> 0:16:55,45
This is really important

483
0:16:55,45 --> 0:16:59,4
It's a high-level form of companionship

484
0:16:59,4 --> 0:17:1,84
I also think that in the context of future solo living

485
0:17:1,84 --> 0:17:4,0
Many people should truly have this kind of relationship

486
0:17:4,0 --> 0:17:8,68
Don't let anyone change your current lifestyle

487
0:17:8,68 --> 0:17:12,55
Don't let anyone alter their life path for you

488
0:17:12,55 --> 0:17:13,93
It's just not worth it

489
0:17:13,93 --> 0:17:16,17
So I think with urbanization

490
0:17:16,17 --> 0:17:17,659
And with the advancement of technology

491
0:17:17,659 --> 0:17:21,199
People gradually breaking free from the constraints of traditional family values

492
0:17:21,199 --> 0:17:22,259
Is very necessary

493
0:17:22,259 --> 0:17:24,519
As for how humans will survive and reproduce in the future

494
0:17:24,519 --> 0:17:28,929
I actually feel that my current state is really great

495
0:17:28,929 --> 0:17:30,529
I do have descendants

496
0:17:30,529 --> 0:17:31,81
Life is also about freedom.

497
0:17:31,81 --> 0:17:32,69
Of course, you know,

498
0:17:32,69 --> 0:17:34,51
you can never completely break away from your parents,

499
0:17:34,51 --> 0:17:34,93
right?

500
0:17:34,93 --> 0:17:37,41
but I think some people have distant family ties,

501
0:17:37,41 --> 0:17:38,97
don’t have a good relationship with their parents,

502
0:17:38,97 --> 0:17:40,28
and that can actually be a good thing.

503
0:17:40,28 --> 0:17:41,16
They don’t have kids,

504
0:17:41,16 --> 0:17:41,88
and they don’t have many worries.

505
0:17:41,88 --> 0:17:43,6
I consider myself invincible.

506
0:17:43,6 --> 0:17:45,78
So I think this is a truly perfect state.

507
0:17:45,78 --> 0:17:46,9
But no matter what,

508
0:17:46,9 --> 0:17:47,84
I just want to tell everyone,

509
0:17:47,84 --> 0:17:49,54
If you love romance,

510
0:17:49,54 --> 0:17:50,48
pursue love,

511
0:17:50,48 --> 0:17:51,46
attain love,

512
0:17:51,46 --> 0:17:52,97
or don't get love,

513
0:17:52,97 --> 0:17:54,97
or you feel being single is better.

514
0:17:54,97 --> 0:17:57,7
Being single, you've found someone who likes you

515
0:17:57,7 --> 0:18:0,26
or you're completely and utterly independent

516
0:18:0,26 --> 0:18:2,8
All four of these states are perfectly fine

517
0:18:2,8 --> 0:18:5,24
as long as you feel at peace with yourself

518
0:18:5,24 --> 0:18:7,2
Peace of mind is where heaven lies

519
0:18:7,2 --> 0:18:8,66
Often, this is how things are

520
0:18:8,66 --> 0:18:14,31
If you're not at ease and always longing for a different state, you might just be missing out

521
0:18:14,31 --> 0:18:16,99
So, often, it's through experiencing marriage that

522
0:18:16,99 --> 0:18:19,3
you truly discover who you are

523
0:18:19,3 --> 0:18:22,45
You know, every time I go through a marriage, or rather,

524
0:18:22,45 --> 0:18:23,93
it's not that every time I go through a marriage,

525
0:18:23,93 --> 0:18:26,81
but when I experience a long-term relationship,

526
0:18:26,81 --> 0:18:29,1
I get really frustrated.

527
0:18:29,1 --> 0:18:30,54
I get really frustrated.

528
0:18:30,54 --> 0:18:35,85
I don't want to fully dedicate my experiences to another person.

529
0:18:35,85 --> 0:18:38,1
And I feel that in reality,

530
0:18:38,1 --> 0:18:43,56
no one can truly keep up with my mental and intellectual level.

531
0:18:43,56 --> 0:18:45,82
Many people are not on the same level as me.

532
0:18:45,82 --> 0:18:47,7
This isn't a boastful statement

533
0:18:47,7 --> 0:18:50,7
but rather that everyone's path is unique

534
0:18:50,7 --> 0:18:52,46
He doesn't know what I'm thinking

535
0:18:52,46 --> 0:18:53,32
What's troubling me

536
0:18:53,32 --> 0:18:55,85
or what worries I might have

537
0:18:55,85 --> 0:18:56,65
It's this kind of thing

538
0:18:56,65 --> 0:19:0,11
You don't know if the other person is on the same wavelength as you

539
0:19:0,11 --> 0:19:3,96
And some trivial matters, how to put it

540
0:19:3,96 --> 0:19:7,58
I'm not particularly interested in the daily necessities like firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea

541
0:19:7,58 --> 0:19:11,92
It's not that I have a strong pursuit of spiritual life

542
0:19:11,92 --> 0:19:14,56
I have a weaker desire for material life

543
0:19:14,56 --> 0:19:17,1
You all can see that my material desires are pretty low

544
0:19:17,1 --> 0:19:18,18
Drive a small car

545
0:19:18,18 --> 0:19:20,37
Live in a modest little house

546
0:19:20,37 --> 0:19:21,21
That's all I need

547
0:19:21,21 --> 0:19:23,13
I don't have many material desires

548
0:19:23,13 --> 0:19:25,1
Of course, I've thought about living a better life

549
0:19:25,1 --> 0:19:30,9
But after weighing the options, I feel that a better life means more wealth

550
0:19:30,9 --> 0:19:31,65
It means higher maintenance costs

551
0:19:31,65 --> 0:19:32,63
The expenses for maintenance

552
0:19:32,63 --> 0:19:33,84
To me

553
0:19:33,84 --> 0:19:36,1
To achieve such a lifestyle

554
0:19:36,1 --> 0:19:38,14
The price to pay might be even higher

555
0:19:38,14 --> 0:19:39,84
When it comes to love

556
0:19:39,84 --> 0:19:41,739
If freedom is what you seek

557
0:19:41,739 --> 0:19:43,119
Both can be sacrificed

558
0:19:43,119 --> 0:19:44,719
Often, that's how it is

559
0:19:44,719 --> 0:19:48,87
Of course, everyone has a different order of priorities in life.

560
0:19:48,87 --> 0:19:50,59
Some people place themselves first.

561
0:19:50,59 --> 0:19:52,71
Others put their family and children at the top.

562
0:19:52,71 --> 0:19:54,55
I also prioritize my children.

563
0:19:54,55 --> 0:19:56,57
However, speaking more broadly,

564
0:19:56,57 --> 0:19:58,85
the highest priority should be oneself.

565
0:19:58,85 --> 0:20:0,95
Because only when one exists,

566
0:20:0,95 --> 0:20:3,28
can one pursue certain things.

567
0:20:3,28 --> 0:20:7,8
So, love, as a form of social guidance,

568
0:20:7,8 --> 0:20:10,909
He’s definitely inclined to help you find a partner.

569
0:20:10,909 --> 0:20:12,549
He wants you to have children, after all.

570
0:20:12,549 --> 0:20:13,869
As a society,

571
0:20:13,869 --> 0:20:15,209
it’s bound to promote this idea.

572
0:20:15,209 --> 0:20:16,11
It’s going to say this,

573
0:20:16,11 --> 0:20:18,91
because it needs to supply the society with fresh labor.

574
0:20:18,91 --> 0:20:20,4
Since you, as a labor force,

575
0:20:20,4 --> 0:20:21,32
are getting old,

576
0:20:21,32 --> 0:20:21,72
right?

577
0:20:21,72 --> 0:20:24,66
You should provide society with a new workforce.

578
0:20:24,66 --> 0:20:25,92
For you,

579
0:20:25,92 --> 0:20:27,51
it means completing the generational upgrade.

580
0:20:27,51 --> 0:20:29,47
Before you completely pass away,

581
0:20:29,47 --> 0:20:31,49
you should spend your money on this.

582
0:20:31,49 --> 0:20:33,31
This is the greatest contribution to society.

583
0:20:33,31 --> 0:20:35,55
But you should understand, as a person,

584
0:20:35,55 --> 0:20:37,59
you wouldn't think that way, right?

585
0:20:37,59 --> 0:20:39,11
As an individual

586
0:20:39,11 --> 0:20:41,91
You can't just think about what society expects from you

587
0:20:41,91 --> 0:20:43,12
or what your family expects

588
0:20:43,12 --> 0:20:44,56
or what your partner expects

589
0:20:44,56 --> 0:20:45,88
or what your children expect

590
0:20:45,88 --> 0:20:48,2
or what you expect from yourself

591
0:20:48,2 --> 0:20:50,17
This is the time for you to figure it out

592
0:20:50,17 --> 0:20:51,61
Don't expect me to give you the answer

593
0:20:51,61 --> 0:20:52,75
You need to go out and find it

594
0:20:52,75 --> 0:20:54,15
It's that simple

595
0:20:54,15 --> 0:20:58,57
So, whether you get love or not, there's no need to be sad.

596
0:20:58,57 --> 0:21:0,7
If you get it, you'll have the worries that come with it.

597
0:21:0,7 --> 0:21:1,95
If you don't, you'll have a different set of worries.

598
0:21:1,95 --> 0:21:4,21
But no matter what,

599
0:21:4,65 --> 0:21:7,41
the place you are in at this moment is where you find peace.

600
0:21:7,41 --> 0:21:8,41
No matter what,

601
0:21:8,41 --> 0:21:11,929
your current state is already a perfect state.

602
0:21:11,929 --> 0:21:13,389
Don't feel ashamed

603
0:21:13,389 --> 0:21:14,769
just because you're single.

604
0:21:14,769 --> 0:21:16,929
Don't think that just because you have a wife now

605
0:21:16,929 --> 0:21:18,36
you're in the safe zone

606
0:21:18,36 --> 0:21:20,54
endless troubles are still waiting for you

607
0:21:20,54 --> 0:21:22,4
so no matter how you look at it

608
0:21:22,4 --> 0:21:23,67
it's a classic case of the grass being greener on the other side

609
0:21:23,67 --> 0:21:25,3
but our aging

610
0:21:25,3 --> 0:21:26,59
our birth, aging, sickness, and death are certain

611
0:21:26,59 --> 0:21:27,47
they are inevitable

612
0:21:27,47 --> 0:21:28,95
death is a given

613
0:21:28,95 --> 0:21:29,65
Good cultivation

614
0:21:29,65 --> 0:21:30,82
It's just like that

615
0:21:30,82 --> 0:21:32,66
But don't be sad because of this

616
0:21:32,66 --> 0:21:33,9
But while we are alive

617
0:21:33,9 --> 0:21:36,2
We need to create the value we want

618
0:21:36,2 --> 0:21:37,0
This is crucial

619
0:21:37,0 --> 0:21:38,32
So for me

620
0:21:38,32 --> 0:21:41,4
No one can truly accompany me on my journey in the future

621
0:21:41,4 --> 0:21:43,4
No one can always be there for me

622
0:21:43,4 --> 0:21:44,88
To explore everything I want to explore

623
0:21:44,88 --> 0:21:47,32
Even my parents can't be with me all the time

624
0:21:47,32 --> 0:21:49,36
My child has their own path in life

625
0:21:49,36 --> 0:21:50,88
So for me

626
0:21:50,88 --> 0:21:53,28
In the end, the only one who will be with me is myself

627
0:21:53,28 --> 0:21:58,12
Ultimately, the person you truly love is a reflection of yourself

628
0:21:58,139 --> 0:21:58,719
Tsk

629
0:21:58,719 --> 0:22:1,19
He isn't a real person

630
0:22:1,19 --> 0:22:3,27
This person changes with time

631
0:22:3,27 --> 0:22:4,41
As your appearance changes,

632
0:22:4,41 --> 0:22:5,43
as you age,

633
0:22:5,43 --> 0:22:6,88
it will keep evolving.

634
0:22:6,88 --> 0:22:8,12
Someone you like in your twenties,

635
0:22:8,12 --> 0:22:10,32
you might not have liked in your teens.

636
0:22:10,32 --> 0:22:11,28
Someone you like in your thirties,

637
0:22:11,28 --> 0:22:13,139
you might not like anymore in your forties.

638
0:22:13,139 --> 0:22:14,219
That's just how it is.

639
0:22:14,219 --> 0:22:16,5
So people always change with these things.

640
0:22:16,5 --> 0:22:18,98
It's always about projecting your own desires

641
0:22:18,98 --> 0:22:21,4
some ideals onto others

642
0:22:21,4 --> 0:22:24,28
until the person can perfectly meet your needs

643
0:22:24,28 --> 0:22:25,58
you'll feel that this person is great

644
0:22:25,58 --> 0:22:27,929
but when the person can't meet your needs as well

645
0:22:27,929 --> 0:22:29,529
you tend to control others

646
0:22:29,529 --> 0:22:31,269
or you might let go

647
0:22:31,269 --> 0:22:33,72
this dynamic is quite subtle

648
0:22:33,72 --> 0:22:35,62
so no matter what

649
0:22:35,62 --> 0:22:37,84
Actually, I mentioned in the last episode

650
0:22:37,84 --> 0:22:42,62
that a person's life is essentially a reality fantasy created by oneself

651
0:22:42,62 --> 0:22:44,94
to complete our lives

652
0:22:44,94 --> 0:22:49,28
Everyone to you is an NPC, this world is a creation of your own heart

653
0:22:49,28 --> 0:22:51,2
crafted by your own mind

654
0:22:51,2 --> 0:22:52,62
it doesn't truly exist

655
0:22:52,62 --> 0:22:55,7
and it's a shared fantasy

656
0:22:55,7 --> 0:22:57,19
this little universe in which you exist

657
0:22:57,19 --> 0:22:58,65
is called an independent fantasy

658
0:22:58,65 --> 0:23:1,159
The world itself is a consensus of imagination.

659
0:23:1,159 --> 0:23:4,259
So you can't prove that the blue someone else sees

660
0:23:4,259 --> 0:23:5,96
isn't the red you see.

661
0:23:5,96 --> 0:23:9,76
You can never fully prove that the world others see

662
0:23:9,76 --> 0:23:12,28
is the same world you see.

663
0:23:12,28 --> 0:23:15,26
This is at the heart of our philosophical thinking.

664
0:23:15,26 --> 0:23:19,74
So you don't need to overly concern yourself with others' opinions and thoughts.

665
0:23:19,74 --> 0:23:21,58
You should live more authentically.

666
0:23:21,58 --> 0:23:23,78
You should be a bit more self-loving.

667
0:23:23,78 --> 0:23:29,59
It's important to focus on your deep feelings about everything.

668
0:23:29,59 --> 0:23:30,59
All of these.

669
0:23:30,59 --> 0:23:31,179
What are your thoughts?

670
0:23:31,179 --> 0:23:32,18
What have you experienced?

671
0:23:32,18 --> 0:23:34,58
These are part of the experiences you gather.

672
0:23:34,58 --> 0:23:36,82
These are valuable things on your life's journey.

673
0:23:36,82 --> 0:23:38,659
These are the most precious things.

674
0:23:38,659 --> 0:23:40,539
So, love itself,

675
0:23:40,539 --> 0:23:44,46
Actually, the reason you pursue external things is

676
0:23:44,46 --> 0:23:46,7
It's due to a lack of something within you.

677
0:23:46,7 --> 0:23:49,2
You pursue what you yearn for.

678
0:23:49,2 --> 0:23:51,34
You hope your partner brings what you desire.

679
0:23:51,34 --> 0:23:52,82
This is a very normal thing.

680
0:23:52,82 --> 0:23:54,62
Of course, you have primal instincts.

681
0:23:54,62 --> 0:23:56,0
There are aspects related to sexuality.

682
0:23:56,0 --> 0:23:57,61
You have certain ideals about love.

683
0:23:57,61 --> 0:23:59,73
Idealized parts of these things.

684
0:23:59,73 --> 0:24:0,73
But no matter what,

685
0:24:0,73 --> 0:24:3,83
You will eventually be defeated by reality.

686
0:24:3,83 --> 0:24:7,11
You will have to consider practical matters eventually.

687
0:24:7,11 --> 0:24:8,91
Whether to move to his city,

688
0:24:8,91 --> 0:24:10,91
Or have him move for you,

689
0:24:10,91 --> 0:24:13,909
Who should live closer to their parents,

690
0:24:13,909 --> 0:24:15,329
What the child’s last name should be,

691
0:24:15,329 --> 0:24:17,529
Where you should buy a house,

692
0:24:17,529 --> 0:24:19,589
A car you don’t like, but he does.

693
0:24:19,589 --> 0:24:20,84
Should you buy it or not?

694
0:24:20,84 --> 0:24:23,98
So there’s an endless array of choices that can be exhausting.

695
0:24:23,98 --> 0:24:25,76
I find it incredibly tiring.

696
0:24:25,76 --> 0:24:29,69
My life should be dedicated to greater pursuits,

697
0:24:29,69 --> 0:24:32,66
Not wasted on trivial matters.

698
0:24:32,66 --> 0:24:36,12
So, to me, marriage is an experience to go through.

699
0:24:36,12 --> 0:24:37,34
I’ve experienced it already.

700
0:24:37,34 --> 0:24:38,62
I know what it’s all about.

701
0:24:38,62 --> 0:24:39,679
So, in that sense,

702
0:24:39,679 --> 0:24:42,239
Life is more about exploration.

703
0:24:42,239 --> 0:24:43,999
There are greater challenges in life.

704
0:24:43,999 --> 0:24:45,699
Don’t let love tie you down.

705
0:24:45,699 --> 0:24:47,33
But at the same time, I say,

706
0:24:47,33 --> 0:24:48,61
Love is great.

707
0:24:48,61 --> 0:24:50,99
Love can transcend social classes,

708
0:24:50,99 --> 0:24:52,639
Even races,

709
0:24:52,639 --> 0:24:53,579
And time itself.

710
0:24:53,579 --> 0:24:54,679
It’s truly great.

711
0:24:54,679 --> 0:24:56,639
It’s a reason for people to keep living.

712
0:24:56,639 --> 0:24:58,36
Of course, there’s romantic love,

713
0:24:58,36 --> 0:24:59,78
And the love between mother and child,

714
0:24:59,78 --> 0:25:1,66
And love for one’s country.

715
0:25:1,66 --> 0:25:3,12
These are all different things.

716
0:25:3,12 --> 0:25:4,14
But no matter what,

717
0:25:4,14 --> 0:25:5,76
Love is a great thing.

718
0:25:5,76 --> 0:25:10,77
Love itself is a great reason why humanity has come this far.

719
0:25:10,77 --> 0:25:11,97
Your compassion for others,

720
0:25:11,97 --> 0:25:13,53
Is also a part of love.

721
0:25:13,53 --> 0:25:16,45
For example, the suffering of children in Gaza today,

722
0:25:16,45 --> 0:25:18,89
You can empathize with others as you would with your own family,

723
0:25:18,89 --> 0:25:20,37
And care for others’ children as you would your own.

724
0:25:20,37 --> 0:25:23,51
This is indeed a manifestation of your inherent kindness.

725
0:25:23,51 --> 0:25:25,7
The role it plays.

726
0:25:25,7 --> 0:25:26,88
So, often times,

727
0:25:26,88 --> 0:25:28,76
We say love and hate are two sides of the same coin.

728
0:25:28,76 --> 0:25:29,92
You have love because,

729
0:25:29,92 --> 0:25:31,56
You also have hate.

730
0:25:31,56 --> 0:25:32,72
Right?

731
0:25:32,72 --> 0:25:34,0
You deeply love your fellow countrymen,

732
0:25:34,0 --> 0:25:35,72
So you hate invaders.

733
0:25:35,72 --> 0:25:36,28
That’s how it is.

734
0:25:36,28 --> 0:25:38,4
You love peace for humanity,

735
0:25:38,4 --> 0:25:40,6
So you hate those who start wars.

736
0:25:40,6 --> 0:25:44,26
But everything has its roots and branches,

737
0:25:44,26 --> 0:25:46,72
Complex interrelationships.

738
0:25:46,72 --> 0:25:49,28
So, let’s not get bogged down in these details today.

739
0:25:49,28 --> 0:25:50,68
But no matter what,

740
0:25:50,68 --> 0:25:51,96
I want to bless everyone,

741
0:25:51,96 --> 0:25:54,6
Whether you choose a life of solitude,

742
0:25:54,6 --> 0:25:56,75
Or encounter multiple partners in life,

743
0:25:56,75 --> 0:26:1,33
Or stay with someone for the long haul, don’t hesitate,

744
0:26:1,33 --> 0:26:2,79
Live without regret,

745
0:26:2,79 --> 0:26:4,77
Be proud of yourself,

746
0:26:4,77 --> 0:26:7,43
Be proud of the choices you make,

747
0:26:7,43 --> 0:26:9,85
Bless others in their choices,

748
0:26:9,85 --> 0:26:11,85
Of course, see others’ pain,

749
0:26:11,85 --> 0:26:13,95
But make your own choices,

750
0:26:13,95 --> 0:26:15,87
And be responsible for those choices,

751
0:26:15,87 --> 0:26:18,27
Bear the consequences of your choices,

752
0:26:18,27 --> 0:26:20,2
And it doesn’t matter,

753
0:26:20,2 --> 0:26:20,72
No matter what,

754
0:26:20,72 --> 0:26:24,48
A life pursuing what you seek, whether you achieve it or not, is a complete life.

755
0:26:24,48 --> 0:26:26,46
Don’t feel ashamed because of it.
