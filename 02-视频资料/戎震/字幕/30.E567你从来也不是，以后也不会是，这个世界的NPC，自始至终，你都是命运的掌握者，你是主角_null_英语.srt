1
0:0:0,68 --> 0:0:1,56
Hey everyone!

2
0:0:1,56 --> 0:0:3,46
This is episode 567.

3
0:0:3,46 --> 0:0:5,24
What should we talk about this time?

4
0:0:5,24 --> 0:0:7,98
Actually, we could continue from the last topic.

5
0:0:7,98 --> 0:0:11,26
In the last episode, I chose the wrong category.

6
0:0:11,26 --> 0:0:13,19
So the views weren’t particularly good.

7
0:0:13,19 --> 0:0:16,41
But every time I make a video,

8
0:0:16,41 --> 0:0:19,45
it’s really a test of fate.

9
0:0:19,45 --> 0:0:22,8
You just see who resonates with what I’m saying at the time.

10
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:24,8
That information will find its way

11
0:0:24,8 --> 0:0:25,62
to the person it's meant for

12
0:0:25,62 --> 0:0:29,6
This is one of the principles that govern the world

13
0:0:29,38 --> 0:0:31,86
When we talk about the breadth of life

14
0:0:31,86 --> 0:0:34,94
your happiness is actually something you control subjectively

15
0:0:34,94 --> 0:0:36,519
It’s just that you might not be aware of it

16
0:0:36,519 --> 0:0:41,219
Until you fully awaken to how the world operates

17
0:0:41,219 --> 0:0:45,2
your understanding is confined to a very narrow scope

18
0:0:45,2 --> 0:0:50,37
which is shaped by the education you receive at home, school, and societal norms

19
0:0:50,37 --> 0:0:53,13
He always tries to mold you into a certain type of person

20
0:0:53,13 --> 0:0:56,61
guiding you towards the path of success

21
0:0:56,61 --> 0:0:58,11
Bro Rong has told you

22
0:0:58,11 --> 0:1:0,53
if you study French, you can break through

23
0:1:0,53 --> 0:1:2,5
for ordinary people

24
0:1:2,5 --> 0:1:6,41
it can help you overcome certain social limitations

25
0:1:6,41 --> 0:1:8,95
we call it exploiting a glitch

26
0:1:8,95 --> 0:1:10,91
but in the real world

27
0:1:10,91 --> 0:1:12,89
there is a common misconception

28
0:1:12,89 --> 0:1:15,71
Because this is different from your experiences in childhood

29
0:1:15,71 --> 0:1:18,71
You might feel incredibly free

30
0:1:18,71 --> 0:1:20,83
You're living a life of your own choosing

31
0:1:20,83 --> 0:1:25,88
But you'll find that in many aspects of life, things are often arranged by fate

32
0:1:25,88 --> 0:1:28,58
Many things are controlled by destiny

33
0:1:28,58 --> 0:1:29,64
You can't control them

34
0:1:29,64 --> 0:1:33,42
But we say the core of fate actually comes down to two things

35
0:1:33,42 --> 0:1:35,0
One is random events

36
0:1:35,0 --> 0:1:37,53
The other is interpersonal relationships

37
0:1:37,53 --> 0:1:39,77
These two things are the most complex.

38
0:1:39,77 --> 0:1:41,49
But they are also the easiest to understand.

39
0:1:41,49 --> 0:1:43,1
When it comes to random events,

40
0:1:43,1 --> 0:1:47,11
we are actually under the control of cause and effect throughout our lives.

41
0:1:47,11 --> 0:1:50,25
Many people ask, Brother Rong, are you starting to talk about metaphysics now?

42
0:1:50,25 --> 0:1:53,35
Actually, I've always been talking about metaphysics.

43
0:1:53,35 --> 0:1:57,71
Sometimes I just put on the guise of the humanities to explain these concepts to you.

44
0:1:57,71 --> 0:1:59,9
So you can understand.

45
0:1:59,9 --> 0:2:2,17
Just like many people don't understand why I insist on talking about Marxist philosophy.

46
0:2:2,17 --> 0:2:4,9
Why is it essential to discuss Adlerian psychology?

47
0:2:4,9 --> 0:2:6,9
Why is it crucial to talk about task differentiation?

48
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:9,31
Why is it important to address narcissistic personality traits?

49
0:2:9,31 --> 0:2:12,67
Because it helps protect you and break through various obstacles in your real life.

50
0:2:12,67 --> 0:2:16,41
It serves as a shield and a breakthrough mechanism.

51
0:2:16,41 --> 0:2:22,73
Young people in every cultural sphere are born with certain advantages.

52
0:2:22,73 --> 0:2:24,17
And some disadvantages as well.

53
0:2:24,17 --> 0:2:26,73
No matter the circumstances of your birth,

54
0:2:26,73 --> 0:2:28,9
Regardless of the country you were born in.

55
0:2:28,9 --> 0:2:30,6
What kind of social standing do you come from?

56
0:2:30,6 --> 0:2:36,2
If you can challenge a future role with your current background and status,

57
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:39,16
you are essentially breaking through the limitations of your existence.

58
0:2:39,16 --> 0:2:42,64
In other words, our minds are always free.

59
0:2:42,64 --> 0:2:44,14
It’s just that our actions are not.

60
0:2:44,14 --> 0:2:47,1
We just differ in our physical conditions.

61
0:2:47,1 --> 0:2:48,58
Some people are physically stronger,

62
0:2:48,58 --> 0:2:49,78
some are weaker,

63
0:2:49,78 --> 0:2:51,1
and some have higher intelligence.

64
0:2:51,1 --> 0:2:52,61
Some people have better looks

65
0:2:52,61 --> 0:2:55,1
Everyone is given different basic conditions

66
0:2:55,1 --> 0:2:56,35
But our consciousness

67
0:2:56,35 --> 0:2:58,13
This combination of consciousness

68
0:2:58,13 --> 0:2:58,89
In itself

69
0:2:58,89 --> 0:3:0,51
This consciousness

70
0:3:0,51 --> 0:3:2,75
It is the same

71
0:3:2,75 --> 0:3:4,51
We are all the same in this regard

72
0:3:4,51 --> 0:3:5,43
So when it comes to it

73
0:3:5,43 --> 0:3:8,219
Actually, the differences between us are just in our intonation and speech.

74
0:3:8,219 --> 0:3:9,259
Our skin tones,

75
0:3:9,259 --> 0:3:10,279
our facial features,

76
0:3:10,279 --> 0:3:11,699
and a variety of basic abilities

77
0:3:11,699 --> 0:3:12,419
have different values.

78
0:3:12,419 --> 0:3:14,2
As I mentioned, the concept of 'Three Begets All Things',

79
0:3:14,2 --> 0:3:19,48
this concept represents the various basic values ranging from one to a hundred percent.

80
0:3:19,48 --> 0:3:21,26
In other words, we are just in different states.

81
0:3:21,26 --> 0:3:24,33
So, why am I explaining these fundamental principles?

82
0:3:24,33 --> 0:3:27,17
Because I'm going to talk about some very complex and profound things

83
0:3:27,17 --> 0:3:29,45
you need to understand this basic principle

84
0:3:29,45 --> 0:3:34,37
which is why I encourage you to pursue a kind of spiritual freedom

85
0:3:34,37 --> 0:3:36,19
and this is actually quite normal

86
0:3:36,19 --> 0:3:39,19
you need to understand three things in life

87
0:3:39,19 --> 0:3:40,92
who you are

88
0:3:40,92 --> 0:3:42,26
where you come from

89
0:3:42,26 --> 0:3:43,4
and where you are headed

90
0:3:43,4 --> 0:3:44,1
some people say

91
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:46,18
We are who we are.

92
0:3:46,18 --> 0:3:48,6
Then we come from our parents.

93
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:49,86
We head towards death.

94
0:3:49,86 --> 0:3:51,38
That’s how it seems on the surface.

95
0:3:51,38 --> 0:3:53,96
On the surface, we rush through this life.

96
0:3:53,96 --> 0:3:55,72
But during this life,

97
0:3:55,72 --> 0:3:58,32
Sometimes, in a fleeting moment while you’re dreaming,

98
0:3:58,32 --> 0:4:1,87
Or when you’re traveling through majestic mountains and rivers,

99
0:4:1,87 --> 0:4:4,15
You might experience a moment of enlightenment.

100
0:4:4,15 --> 0:4:6,91
Suddenly, you'll feel incredibly joyful

101
0:4:6,91 --> 0:4:7,89
Extremely refreshed

102
0:4:7,89 --> 0:4:9,85
It's like, wow, just a moment of pure bliss

103
0:4:9,85 --> 0:4:10,77
That's the feeling

104
0:4:10,77 --> 0:4:14,3
It will happen a few times in your life

105
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:15,34
To be more precise

106
0:4:15,34 --> 0:4:18,33
This is something you encounter, how to put it

107
0:4:18,33 --> 0:4:21,25
Let's not try to explain it with mystical concepts

108
0:4:21,25 --> 0:4:25,25
It's simply a profound experience of happiness

109
0:4:25,25 --> 0:4:29,14
You will gradually get closer to understanding what you're meant to do in this life.

110
0:4:29,14 --> 0:4:32,2
Everyone has a main mission in this regard.

111
0:4:32,2 --> 0:4:36,21
It's not about some mundane significance.

112
0:4:36,21 --> 0:4:38,1
In other words, in your lifetime,

113
0:4:38,1 --> 0:4:40,9
you must figure out what you're here to do.

114
0:4:40,9 --> 0:4:42,34
You need to think this through clearly.

115
0:4:42,34 --> 0:4:43,42
Get it straight in your mind.

116
0:4:43,42 --> 0:4:45,6
Why do I tell everyone to make money?

117
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:46,97
To control the use of money.

118
0:4:46,97 --> 0:4:48,17
To gain power

119
0:4:48,17 --> 0:4:50,13
wealth and prestige, these things

120
0:4:50,13 --> 0:4:53,25
the core reason is to delve into research

121
0:4:53,25 --> 0:4:55,19
to extend your lifespan

122
0:4:55,19 --> 0:5:0,8
or to give you more time for spiritual exploration

123
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:2,72
which means freeing you from labor

124
0:5:2,72 --> 0:5:4,68
so all of this is just a means

125
0:5:4,68 --> 0:5:6,7
it’s not the end goal

126
0:5:6,7 --> 0:5:9,51
and why you encounter various kinds of spiritual harm

127
0:5:9,51 --> 0:5:11,74
A variety of mental aspects

128
0:5:11,74 --> 0:5:13,64
Teach you how to resist them

129
0:5:13,64 --> 0:5:18,59
It's because only by building a robust mental defense mechanism

130
0:5:18,59 --> 0:5:21,31
Can you face more challenges in the future

131
0:5:21,31 --> 0:5:21,79
That is to say

132
0:5:21,79 --> 0:5:23,35
In our era

133
0:5:23,35 --> 0:5:26,909
Many things appear on the surface

134
0:5:27,709 --> 0:5:28,989
Nothing seems to happen

135
0:5:28,989 --> 0:5:31,729
On the surface, we should all know how to handle it

136
0:5:31,729 --> 0:5:32,949
living a life of mediocrity

137
0:5:32,949 --> 0:5:34,869
and ultimately end it this way

138
0:5:34,869 --> 0:5:36,32
but it's not like that

139
0:5:36,32 --> 0:5:40,72
in fact, every day we brush past all sorts of opportunities

140
0:5:40,72 --> 0:5:44,7
we constantly brush past death and good fortune

141
0:5:44,7 --> 0:5:48,42
and what ultimately determines our lifespan is certainly not set in stone

142
0:5:48,42 --> 0:5:52,929
for instance, this morning there was a sudden tsunami and earthquake in the Kamchatka Peninsula

143
0:5:52,929 --> 0:5:56,169
so in this world, many things are like that

144
0:5:56,169 --> 0:5:57,329
how should we put it

145
0:5:57,329 --> 0:5:59,49
It was like the mask incident back then

146
0:5:59,49 --> 0:6:2,5
Those were unforeseen events at the time

147
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:4,75
It can quickly alter the state of your life

148
0:6:4,75 --> 0:6:7,53
In other words, we all have a survival instinct

149
0:6:7,53 --> 0:6:9,83
But these are things that span multiple lifetimes

150
0:6:9,83 --> 0:6:11,35
What we call past, present, and future lives

151
0:6:11,35 --> 0:6:12,2
Regardless

152
0:6:12,2 --> 0:6:13,12
You have something

153
0:6:13,12 --> 0:6:15,2
A core pursuit or goal

154
0:6:15,2 --> 0:6:17,28
That is to say, if this goal exists

155
0:6:17,28 --> 0:6:19,34
you have found your mission and completed it

156
0:6:19,34 --> 0:6:20,5
you wouldn't need to

157
0:6:20,5 --> 0:6:23,96
go through the cycles of suffering and hardship in life after life

158
0:6:23,96 --> 0:6:25,38
isn't it better to achieve the purpose?

159
0:6:25,38 --> 0:6:28,8
This is actually the ultimate goal of our lives

160
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:32,8
But I believe everyone's understanding and insight are different

161
0:6:32,8 --> 0:6:35,6
So not everyone might truly grasp the purpose behind what I'm saying

162
0:6:35,6 --> 0:6:36,95
Perhaps there is no purpose at all

163
0:6:36,95 --> 0:6:39,9
But let's put it in more down-to-earth terms

164
0:6:39,9 --> 0:6:40,47
What Brother Rong is telling you

165
0:6:40,47 --> 0:6:41,71
At the very least, after you've heard it

166
0:6:41,71 --> 0:6:45,549
You should understand where your life should be heading

167
0:6:45,549 --> 0:6:48,29
Or you need to figure out how to make money

168
0:6:48,29 --> 0:6:49,87
How to earn and spend it

169
0:6:49,87 --> 0:6:51,53
Not a penny should be left unspent

170
0:6:51,53 --> 0:6:52,51
In many cases

171
0:6:52,51 --> 0:6:54,93
You need to understand what the meaning of life really is

172
0:6:54,93 --> 0:6:56,65
If you understand this meaning

173
0:6:56,65 --> 0:6:58,63
or if you define this meaning yourself

174
0:6:58,63 --> 0:6:59,53
either way

175
0:6:59,53 --> 0:7:1,37
the uncertainties in your life

176
0:7:1,37 --> 0:7:3,43
you won't live aimlessly

177
0:7:3,43 --> 0:7:5,83
you won't live without a goal every day

178
0:7:5,83 --> 0:7:7,15
like how I live each day now

179
0:7:7,15 --> 0:7:8,57
I have a clear purpose

180
0:7:8,57 --> 0:7:9,97
I live with a clear purpose

181
0:7:9,97 --> 0:7:10,81
So, to explain,

182
0:7:10,81 --> 0:7:13,33
your lifespan can be extended when you find purpose.

183
0:7:13,33 --> 0:7:14,919
It will be prolonged.

184
0:7:14,919 --> 0:7:16,839
Because lifespan can vary in length.

185
0:7:16,839 --> 0:7:18,559
Many people don't understand this concept.

186
0:7:18,559 --> 0:7:20,759
They think lifespan is influenced by health.

187
0:7:20,759 --> 0:7:23,24
Or they believe it's determined by one's birth chart.

188
0:7:23,24 --> 0:7:24,81
However, it's actually variable.

189
0:7:24,81 --> 0:7:27,71
It really depends on how long you can stay in a place.

190
0:7:27,71 --> 0:7:30,51
It depends on whether you can find your main quest.

191
0:7:30,51 --> 0:7:32,15
When you manage to find your main quest,

192
0:7:32,15 --> 0:7:34,23
and the more you do, the more tasks you'll have.

193
0:7:34,23 --> 0:7:36,15
The tasks become increasingly complex.

194
0:7:36,15 --> 0:7:39,95
As the variety and frequency of your services increase,

195
0:7:39,95 --> 0:7:42,15
your lifespan will actually be extended.

196
0:7:42,15 --> 0:7:44,59
When you are in a state of unawareness,

197
0:7:44,59 --> 0:7:47,7
When you are in a state of deep contradiction,

198
0:7:47,7 --> 0:7:47,95
Many people would say

199
0:7:47,95 --> 0:7:49,27
What we call failing to make it nowadays

200
0:7:49,27 --> 0:7:49,909
is a reset

201
0:7:49,909 --> 0:7:51,689
Actually, it's a form of protection

202
0:7:51,689 --> 0:7:55,35
It quickly propels you into a new life journey

203
0:7:55,35 --> 0:7:57,63
To gain a better learning experience

204
0:7:57,63 --> 0:8:0,14
So everything is for the sake of learning

205
0:8:0,14 --> 0:8:5,51
Speaking of which, Elon Musk has said that the probability of our world being real is very low

206
0:8:5,51 --> 0:8:7,57
When considering many worlds

207
0:8:7,57 --> 0:8:12,57
In reality, their purpose isn't what it appears to be on the surface

208
0:8:12,77 --> 0:8:13,929
Got it?

209
0:8:15,569 --> 0:8:16,249
Understand the country

210
0:8:16,249 --> 0:8:17,489
Understand how history works

211
0:8:17,489 --> 0:8:19,909
These things are relatively simple, actually

212
0:8:19,909 --> 0:8:21,529
Because when you look at some things

213
0:8:21,529 --> 0:8:24,76
For example, like the game Go

214
0:8:24,76 --> 0:8:25,88
Guild Two

215
0:8:25,88 --> 0:8:27,12
Guild Three, this game

216
0:8:27,12 --> 0:8:29,72
You'll find that playing this game is entirely in English

217
0:8:29,72 --> 0:8:32,62
Basically, not many people play it in the country.

218
0:8:32,62 --> 0:8:33,74
It's very niche.

219
0:8:33,74 --> 0:8:38,21
You'll notice that one's career, financial accumulation,

220
0:8:38,21 --> 0:8:40,29
and even political success,

221
0:8:40,29 --> 0:8:41,85
are often related to the family,

222
0:8:41,85 --> 0:8:44,18
or more broadly, the extended family.

223
0:8:44,18 --> 0:8:49,82
So, wealth and nobility usually don't come from just one or two generations.

224
0:8:49,82 --> 0:8:54,74
That's why many of you don't fully understand,

225
0:8:54,74 --> 0:8:56,19
sociology or historiography.

226
0:8:56,19 --> 0:8:57,35
Or political science

227
0:8:57,35 --> 0:8:58,47
Why is sociology

228
0:8:58,47 --> 0:8:58,91
Historiography

229
0:8:58,91 --> 0:8:59,49
Political science

230
0:8:59,49 --> 0:9:1,76
International relations and psychology

231
0:9:1,76 --> 0:9:3,92
Economics and such are what I refer to as the six arts

232
0:9:3,92 --> 0:9:5,92
Let's just focus on political science

233
0:9:5,92 --> 0:9:7,62
When it comes to sociology and historiography

234
0:9:7,62 --> 0:9:9,7
You're seeing the development of human society

235
0:9:9,7 --> 0:9:11,63
The rise and fall of nations

236
0:9:11,63 --> 0:9:12,83
you need to understand

237
0:9:12,83 --> 0:9:17,1
the time when humans truly achieved equality is not long

238
0:9:17,1 --> 0:9:18,29
to be precise

239
0:9:18,29 --> 0:9:19,29
our world

240
0:9:19,29 --> 0:9:21,9
our society has always been unfair

241
0:9:21,9 --> 0:9:23,44
it's precisely because of this unfairness

242
0:9:23,44 --> 0:9:26,64
that you can't expect others to be fair to you

243
0:9:30,95 --> 0:9:33,29
different rules are in effect simultaneously

244
0:9:33,29 --> 0:9:34,8
For instance, the survival of the fittest

245
0:9:34,8 --> 0:9:37,2
the law of the jungle is like the robes of today

246
0:9:37,2 --> 0:9:39,52
people are treated like livestock

247
0:9:39,52 --> 0:9:41,75
casually slaughtered by Israel

248
0:9:41,75 --> 0:9:44,7
this is truly a terrifying situation

249
0:9:44,7 --> 0:9:48,76
but its existence serves as a wake-up call to everyone in the world

250
0:9:48,76 --> 0:9:49,8
including the Russia-Ukraine conflict

251
0:9:49,8 --> 0:9:51,2
it often plays out this way

252
0:9:51,2 --> 0:9:53,92
it makes people in the real world realize

253
0:9:53,92 --> 0:9:56,58
Life is so hard-won.

254
0:9:56,58 --> 0:9:58,27
That's often the case.

255
0:9:58,27 --> 0:10:4,27
So, when you look at the growth and response in global population's mindset, it becomes clear.

256
0:10:4,27 --> 0:10:7,91
The sacrifices these people make can be very justified.

257
0:10:7,91 --> 0:10:9,75
Or even great.

258
0:10:9,75 --> 0:10:10,55
Selfless.

259
0:10:10,55 --> 0:10:11,53
It's no easy feat.

260
0:10:11,53 --> 0:10:17,57
But it's all about whether you can step out of your mental box to see these things.

261
0:10:17,57 --> 0:10:22,11
Sometimes, I just unintentionally want to enlighten certain people.

262
0:10:22,11 --> 0:10:24,93
Because it's impossible for everyone to go to work

263
0:10:24,93 --> 0:10:29,14
I guess many people can understand what I'm talking about

264
0:10:29,14 --> 0:10:30,2
Many people say, Brother Rong

265
0:10:30,2 --> 0:10:31,26
How come you're getting more and more abstract?

266
0:10:31,26 --> 0:10:33,7
Actually, I've never been abstract

267
0:10:33,7 --> 0:10:36,6
I've always been speaking along this central axis

268
0:10:36,6 --> 0:10:39,24
It's just that everyone understands their place in life

269
0:10:39,24 --> 0:10:42,52
Or their position in the process of enlightenment

270
0:10:42,52 --> 0:10:44,4
Differently

271
0:10:44,4 --> 0:10:46,58
So some people need to address survival issues

272
0:10:46,58 --> 0:10:48,56
Others have to deal with worldly problems

273
0:10:48,56 --> 0:10:49,65
How to earn money

274
0:10:49,65 --> 0:10:51,41
How to find a wife

275
0:10:51,41 --> 0:10:52,35
How to buy a good car

276
0:10:52,35 --> 0:10:54,9
They need to tackle these issues

277
0:10:54,9 --> 0:10:57,14
Of course, once some people resolve these practical concerns

278
0:10:57,14 --> 0:11:0,66
Their lives are dedicated to the pursuit of truth

279
0:11:0,66 --> 0:11:2,62
To the quest for the meaning of life

280
0:11:2,62 --> 0:11:4,94
My words might be more useful for that type of person.

281
0:11:4,94 --> 0:11:7,26
But let's not get into such complicated matters.

282
0:11:7,26 --> 0:11:8,9
What I really want to address is

283
0:11:8,9 --> 0:11:11,85
why I'm introducing Adlerian psychology to everyone.

284
0:11:11,85 --> 0:11:14,49
Why am I talking about Machiavelli as an example?

285
0:11:14,49 --> 0:11:19,13
Actually, the reason Machiavelli's book came into being is

286
0:11:19,13 --> 0:11:22,11
everyone has different perspectives, after all.

287
0:11:22,11 --> 0:11:26,96
If he was only advising the king on 'The Prince',

288
0:11:26,96 --> 0:11:29,36
there would have been no need for him to publish it.

289
0:11:29,36 --> 0:11:32,16
Just among the Medici family

290
0:11:32,16 --> 0:11:36,59
or circulated among a few high-ranking nobles as his manuscripts

291
0:11:36,59 --> 0:11:38,819
or he could work as a private tutor

292
0:11:38,819 --> 0:11:39,579
and that would be it

293
0:11:39,579 --> 0:11:39,939
right?

294
0:11:39,939 --> 0:11:42,219
or he might be recorded in history, it doesn’t matter

295
0:11:42,219 --> 0:11:44,28
but as a public publication

296
0:11:44,28 --> 0:11:47,24
he would be like all the common people

297
0:11:47,24 --> 0:11:49,5
explaining the workings of politics

298
0:11:49,5 --> 0:11:53,51
What kind of game are these so-called emperors and nobles playing?

299
0:11:53,51 --> 0:11:55,97
In fact, society has always been stratified into three levels.

300
0:11:55,97 --> 0:11:58,3
We talk about the middle class,

301
0:11:58,3 --> 0:11:58,9
the lower class,

302
0:11:58,9 --> 0:11:59,62
and the upper class.

303
0:11:59,62 --> 0:12:0,88
But in reality,

304
0:12:0,88 --> 0:12:3,3
society always has its kings,

305
0:12:3,3 --> 0:12:3,9
its nobles,

306
0:12:3,9 --> 0:12:4,74
and its commoners.

307
0:12:4,74 --> 0:12:6,48
In any world

308
0:12:6,48 --> 0:12:7,34
any country

309
0:12:7,34 --> 0:12:10,72
it's just that now the nobility has turned into the intelligentsia

310
0:12:10,72 --> 0:12:12,41
entrepreneurs

311
0:12:12,41 --> 0:12:16,17
the middle class, they together form an interest group

312
0:12:16,17 --> 0:12:18,69
the middle class is also an interest group

313
0:12:18,69 --> 0:12:19,529
speaking of high productivity

314
0:12:19,529 --> 0:12:22,249
the elite class at the top can have their own set of rules

315
0:12:22,249 --> 0:12:23,509
for those at the bottom

316
0:12:23,509 --> 0:12:24,78
we tend to want to move up

317
0:12:24,78 --> 0:12:28,78
so this is like the Estates-General during the French Revolution

318
0:12:28,78 --> 0:12:32,86
whenever we find ourselves in a certain class

319
0:12:32,86 --> 0:12:34,54
it limits our actions

320
0:12:34,54 --> 0:12:35,62
it limits our thinking

321
0:12:35,62 --> 0:12:36,62
it limits our understanding

322
0:12:36,62 --> 0:12:37,95
many things are like this

323
0:12:37,95 --> 0:12:42,75
but these aren't the true essence of striving in society

324
0:12:42,75 --> 0:12:45,27
because life is actually very finite

325
0:12:45,27 --> 0:12:49,67
What you pursue at 20 is entirely different from what you seek after 30.

326
0:12:49,67 --> 0:12:51,23
What you pursue at 20

327
0:12:51,23 --> 0:12:54,6
it actually controls you

328
0:12:54,6 --> 0:12:55,94
is more influenced by your instincts

329
0:12:55,94 --> 0:12:57,38
but when you hit 30

330
0:12:57,38 --> 0:12:58,93
some people enter family life

331
0:12:58,93 --> 0:13:0,41
some don't enter family life

332
0:13:0,41 --> 0:13:2,49
and still maintain that 20-year-old state

333
0:13:2,49 --> 0:13:3,65
and that's actually quite alright too

334
0:13:3,65 --> 0:13:4,69
If you remain unmarried

335
0:13:4,69 --> 0:13:5,57
and don't settle down

336
0:13:5,57 --> 0:13:7,54
you maintain a youthful state

337
0:13:7,54 --> 0:13:8,42
which is actually quite good

338
0:13:8,42 --> 0:13:10,78
but after 35, up to 40

339
0:13:10,78 --> 0:13:12,36
your physical stamina declines

340
0:13:12,36 --> 0:13:14,6
and your interest and hormone levels decrease

341
0:13:14,6 --> 0:13:18,9
you might find that pursuing material things

342
0:13:18,9 --> 0:13:20,42
is less stimulating for you

343
0:13:20,42 --> 0:13:22,12
Your instinctual stimulation is not as strong

344
0:13:22,12 --> 0:13:24,72
Your desire to procreate is not as intense

345
0:13:24,72 --> 0:13:28,36
At this point, you'll notice that the social aspect of humans diminishes

346
0:13:28,36 --> 0:13:31,74
The actual value you can contribute to society

347
0:13:31,74 --> 0:13:34,82
As an ordinary person in a subordinate state

348
0:13:34,82 --> 0:13:36,0
This condition of yours

349
0:13:36,0 --> 0:13:39,55
Becomes less significant in terms of social value and function

350
0:13:39,55 --> 0:13:42,9
Because you're no longer generating value

351
0:13:42,9 --> 0:13:45,47
Your contribution to other members of society, how should I put it

352
0:13:45,47 --> 0:13:48,3
What you can offer will diminish.

353
0:13:48,3 --> 0:13:52,9
This is actually a rather terrifying reality.

354
0:13:52,9 --> 0:13:55,47
Once you are in a society,

355
0:13:55,47 --> 0:13:59,19
if you are not very useful to others,

356
0:13:59,19 --> 0:14:2,12
the pace of your social relationships,

357
0:14:2,12 --> 0:14:5,569
the rate at which you accumulate wealth,

358
0:14:5,569 --> 0:14:7,949
the simpler your social connections become,

359
0:14:7,949 --> 0:14:12,44
the higher the likelihood that you will be overlooked or cut off.

360
0:14:12,44 --> 0:14:15,1
Generally speaking, we consider China to be a relationship-based society.

361
0:14:15,1 --> 0:14:18,14
But the relational society in China is actually a good thing.

362
0:14:18,14 --> 0:14:21,22
If you really go to Western societies or even to Japanese society,

363
0:14:21,22 --> 0:14:26,739
where Japan is also considered part of the particularly cold capitalist societies,

364
0:14:26,739 --> 0:14:31,48
a purely non-relation-based society, not built on blood ties or personal connections,

365
0:14:31,48 --> 0:14:33,72
what is known as a contractual society,

366
0:14:33,72 --> 0:14:35,76
you'll find everything is quite cold.

367
0:14:35,76 --> 0:14:36,98
When it comes to this society,

368
0:14:36,98 --> 0:14:38,48
if you don't have much of an impact,

369
0:14:38,48 --> 0:14:40,19
if you don't participate in community activities,

370
0:14:40,19 --> 0:14:44,53
Sometimes, you encounter people who are very polite to your face

371
0:14:44,53 --> 0:14:48,9
but in reality, they keep their distance from you

372
0:14:48,9 --> 0:14:50,12
This is the essence of Western society

373
0:14:50,12 --> 0:14:51,4
In China

374
0:14:51,4 --> 0:14:52,28
the distance between people

375
0:14:52,28 --> 0:14:53,36
due to the population size

376
0:14:53,36 --> 0:14:55,63
and cultural habits, is often closer

377
0:14:55,63 --> 0:14:58,11
However, being close has its advantages

378
0:14:58,11 --> 0:14:59,86
and its disadvantages

379
0:14:59,86 --> 0:15:2,2
This emotional detachment has its benefits

380
0:15:2,2 --> 0:15:3,16
but it also has its drawbacks

381
0:15:3,16 --> 0:15:5,63
so it's all about personal experience

382
0:15:5,63 --> 0:15:8,91
However, when people enter this age group

383
0:15:8,91 --> 0:15:10,77
they tend to think a lot

384
0:15:10,77 --> 0:15:12,25
about issues in the humanities

385
0:15:12,25 --> 0:15:15,18
such as social development and reproduction

386
0:15:15,18 --> 0:15:17,82
and the merits and demerits of history

387
0:15:17,82 --> 0:15:19,1
from a political perspective

388
0:15:19,1 --> 0:15:21,72
How can we maximize the utility of society?

389
0:15:21,72 --> 0:15:24,449
How can a nation and its people thrive and prosper?

390
0:15:24,449 --> 0:15:26,0
These are all his goals.

391
0:15:26,0 --> 0:15:28,4
But from your personal perspective,

392
0:15:28,4 --> 0:15:30,92
whether you contribute to society or not,

393
0:15:30,92 --> 0:15:32,8
whether you make a contribution to history,

394
0:15:32,8 --> 0:15:35,36
or whether you struggle to make ends meet,

395
0:15:35,36 --> 0:15:36,56
none of these things matter.

396
0:15:36,56 --> 0:15:39,27
Because you have a mission that is yours alone in this life.

397
0:15:39,27 --> 0:15:40,99
There's also your lifelong mission

398
0:15:40,99 --> 0:15:42,49
I don't understand this

399
0:15:42,49 --> 0:15:44,69
I'm not sure if I can explain it in one sentence

400
0:15:44,69 --> 0:15:47,1
or if it can be clarified through a few videos

401
0:15:47,1 --> 0:15:54,62
The pursuit of pleasure and luxury is something everyone tends to seek

402
0:15:54,62 --> 0:15:55,82
out of the instinct for survival

403
0:15:55,82 --> 0:15:56,68
it's the pursuit

404
0:15:56,68 --> 0:15:59,26
but once these things are attained, they are attained

405
0:15:59,26 --> 0:16:1,28
and if they can't be attained, then don't pursue them

406
0:16:1,28 --> 0:16:2,24
It's no problem.

407
0:16:2,24 --> 0:16:5,53
It doesn't really affect our daily intake of 2200 calories.

408
0:16:5,53 --> 0:16:6,71
Sunlight, air, and water,

409
0:16:6,71 --> 0:16:8,23
things like sleep,

410
0:16:8,23 --> 0:16:10,15
In modern society,

411
0:16:10,15 --> 0:16:12,6
they are things that require consumption.

412
0:16:12,6 --> 0:16:14,7
They provide you with something.

413
0:16:14,7 --> 0:16:16,71
I need to have money.

414
0:16:16,71 --> 0:16:17,51
I have money.

415
0:16:17,51 --> 0:16:18,71
I can have good things

416
0:16:18,71 --> 0:16:20,95
I can have a higher quality of life

417
0:16:20,95 --> 0:16:23,79
But fundamentally

418
0:16:24,17 --> 0:16:26,45
you are a part of society

419
0:16:26,45 --> 0:16:30,37
you need to maintain the functions that keep society running

420
0:16:30,37 --> 0:16:33,17
you need to provide energy to society

421
0:16:33,17 --> 0:16:34,12
Do you understand?

422
0:16:34,12 --> 0:16:37,22
So this is a state you are programmed to be in

423
0:16:37,22 --> 0:16:40,13
So it means that if you understand the humanities

424
0:16:40,13 --> 0:16:41,85
You can understand yourself

425
0:16:41,85 --> 0:16:43,93
Society has expectations of you

426
0:16:43,93 --> 0:16:45,61
You are a young man

427
0:16:45,61 --> 0:16:46,93
You are a young woman

428
0:16:46,93 --> 0:16:49,339
Your role in society is significant

429
0:16:49,339 --> 0:16:51,239
You are rewarded with 3600 yuan

430
0:16:51,239 --> 0:16:54,299
But are you truly happy?

431
0:16:54,299 --> 0:16:55,719
Only you know the answer

432
0:16:55,719 --> 0:16:59,39
So Brother Rong is here to talk about how to achieve personal happiness

433
0:16:59,39 --> 0:17:3,21
That is, you can only achieve this after you've resolved your survival issues.

434
0:17:3,21 --> 0:17:5,25
After addressing some philosophical questions,

435
0:17:5,25 --> 0:17:6,55
some psychological needs,

436
0:17:6,55 --> 0:17:7,77
and spiritual needs,

437
0:17:7,77 --> 0:17:9,34
you will truly be happy.

438
0:17:9,34 --> 0:17:12,38
In other words, there are certain tasks you must accomplish.

439
0:17:12,38 --> 0:17:15,54
For example, who you are,

440
0:17:15,73 --> 0:17:17,17
who you are,

441
0:17:17,17 --> 0:17:18,87
in fact, you don't really know who you are.

442
0:17:18,87 --> 0:17:20,77
You feel like you know who you are

443
0:17:20,77 --> 0:17:23,6
But in fact, you don't really know who you are

444
0:17:23,3 --> 0:17:26,34
It might sound quite mystical

445
0:17:26,34 --> 0:17:28,18
But if you watch this show at night

446
0:17:28,18 --> 0:17:29,82
I wouldn't recommend doing it now

447
0:17:29,82 --> 0:17:32,87
Because you might be scared to do it during the day

448
0:17:32,87 --> 0:17:35,21
This is called the mirror person exercise

449
0:17:35,21 --> 0:17:38,2
It involves staring at your reflection in the mirror

450
0:17:38,2 --> 0:17:39,34
Looking at yourself

451
0:17:39,34 --> 0:17:42,89
At the very beginning, just don't think about anything.

452
0:17:42,89 --> 0:17:44,11
Look at this person.

453
0:17:44,11 --> 0:17:51,5
Until there's a moment when you suddenly feel this person is very unfamiliar.

454
0:17:51,5 --> 0:17:53,51
This is a feeling your brain gives you in an instant.

455
0:17:53,51 --> 0:17:54,92
That this person seems very unfamiliar.

456
0:17:54,92 --> 0:17:58,96
Because we tend to have a filter for how we perceive people we know.

457
0:17:58,96 --> 0:17:59,92
We idealize them.

458
0:17:59,92 --> 0:18:1,14
We fill in the gaps.

459
0:18:1,14 --> 0:18:2,24
You need to recognize yourself.

460
0:18:2,24 --> 0:18:5,97
Not all animals can recognize themselves, a sign of self-awareness.

461
0:18:5,97 --> 0:18:7,27
This is an instinct of humans.

462
0:18:7,27 --> 0:18:10,65
But there's a moment when you feel detached from a situation.

463
0:18:10,65 --> 0:18:13,679
Oh, this person looks either really ugly or really handsome.

464
0:18:13,679 --> 0:18:15,319
But you don't know them well.

465
0:18:15,319 --> 0:18:17,519
It's as if they are a completely different person.

466
0:18:17,519 --> 0:18:20,86
This is a very interesting state.

467
0:18:20,86 --> 0:18:24,1
At this point, you enter into an observer mode.

468
0:18:24,1 --> 0:18:25,62
It's like when you play CS.

469
0:18:25,62 --> 0:18:26,46
You're out.

470
0:18:26,46 --> 0:18:29,75
Suddenly, you find yourself attached to your teammate.

471
0:18:29,75 --> 0:18:31,71
Or you can jump back and forth in the void.

472
0:18:31,71 --> 0:18:33,3
That's the state you're in.

473
0:18:33,3 --> 0:18:34,22
It's something you can achieve.

474
0:18:34,22 --> 0:18:35,74
When you're completely relaxed.

475
0:18:35,74 --> 0:18:38,26
You'll find yourself in observer mode.

476
0:18:38,26 --> 0:18:39,82
At this point, you can ponder some questions.

477
0:18:39,82 --> 0:18:44,73
It's different from when you usually carry your emotions and self-awareness.

478
0:18:44,73 --> 0:18:49,83
So, I'm talking about what truly allows you to perceive the essence of life

479
0:18:49,83 --> 0:18:52,7
and the mysteries of life.

480
0:18:52,7 --> 0:18:57,27
But I think some of these ideas might be a bit advanced for my followers today.

481
0:18:57,27 --> 0:19:0,55
Even though I have 678,000 followers now,

482
0:19:0,55 --> 0:19:3,51
I doubt more than 50 of them would really understand these concepts.

483
0:19:3,51 --> 0:19:4,35
No more than 50 people.

484
0:19:4,35 --> 0:19:5,8
It's a matter of probability.

485
0:19:5,8 --> 0:19:6,92
But that's okay.

486
0:19:6,92 --> 0:19:7,64
I still want to share.

487
0:19:7,64 --> 0:19:8,86
Because of these things

488
0:19:8,86 --> 0:19:10,28
My video materials

489
0:19:10,28 --> 0:19:11,94
My voice and appearance

490
0:19:11,94 --> 0:19:14,6
They will exist on the internet for a long time

491
0:19:14,6 --> 0:19:15,4
They will come into play at special times

492
0:19:15,4 --> 0:19:16,46
For special people

493
0:19:16,46 --> 0:19:19,28
They will have a certain, how to put it,

494
0:19:19,28 --> 0:19:21,21
A very subtle effect

495
0:19:21,21 --> 0:19:22,89
Of course, this is not crucial

496
0:19:22,89 --> 0:19:25,37
So, I want to discuss the ultimate meaning of sociology with you.

497
0:19:25,37 --> 0:19:28,9
As an individual in society,

498
0:19:28,9 --> 0:19:32,47
you are useful to society.

499
0:19:32,47 --> 0:19:35,11
When you are no longer useful to society,

500
0:19:35,11 --> 0:19:37,659
when society disconnects from you,

501
0:19:37,659 --> 0:19:40,879
you may seem like an useless person,

502
0:19:40,879 --> 0:19:42,9
completely useless,

503
0:19:42,9 --> 0:19:45,73
but in reality, when it comes to the universe and the creator,

504
0:19:45,73 --> 0:19:47,44
you are still useful.

505
0:19:47,44 --> 0:19:51,4
You are an integral part of this world or even the universe.

506
0:19:51,4 --> 0:19:52,72
You always have value.

507
0:19:52,72 --> 0:19:54,56
It's just that you might not be useful to a particular society,

508
0:19:54,56 --> 0:19:55,72
or a specific group,

509
0:19:55,72 --> 0:19:57,32
or a certain company.

510
0:19:57,32 --> 0:19:58,48
Just like a company,

511
0:19:58,48 --> 0:20:0,2
where you are staying,

512
0:20:0,2 --> 0:20:1,889
you feel very uncomfortable,

513
0:20:1,889 --> 0:20:2,789
and you often think about quitting.

514
0:20:2,789 --> 0:20:5,72
But at that point, you might feel like you're not valuable.

515
0:20:5,88 --> 0:20:7,18
Don't have that feeling.

516
0:20:7,18 --> 0:20:9,68
It's just that you and the company don't vibe well together.

517
0:20:9,68 --> 0:20:11,92
The longer you stay at this company,

518
0:20:11,92 --> 0:20:15,41
the longer you stay in this society,

519
0:20:15,41 --> 0:20:17,87
you'll find that you dislike the social norms here.

520
0:20:17,87 --> 0:20:19,67
You dislike the company culture.

521
0:20:19,67 --> 0:20:21,75
It doesn’t mean there isn’t a better place for you.

522
0:20:21,75 --> 0:20:23,31
So, Brother Rong sometimes tells you

523
0:20:23,31 --> 0:20:24,56
Some information from abroad

524
0:20:24,56 --> 0:20:27,8
It's possible that other societies might be more suitable for you

525
0:20:27,8 --> 0:20:30,159
The reason why you might not fit in is

526
0:20:30,159 --> 0:20:32,239
Let me put it in a rather mystical way

527
0:20:32,239 --> 0:20:35,74
You have less experience here

528
0:20:35,74 --> 0:20:38,12
So you're not accustomed to the environment here

529
0:20:38,12 --> 0:20:40,16
That's why you've been frail and often ill since birth

530
0:20:40,16 --> 0:20:42,53
Some people would say it like this

531
0:20:42,53 --> 0:20:45,17
From the perspective of traditional Chinese mysticism

532
0:20:45,17 --> 0:20:46,469
You're destined to be a child

533
0:20:46,469 --> 0:20:49,469
But sometimes it's not about using such things to explain it

534
0:20:49,469 --> 0:20:50,629
Being destined to be a child is just that

535
0:20:50,629 --> 0:20:54,35
Because the understanding of ancient people was limited

536
0:20:54,35 --> 0:20:57,48
Unlike Brother Rong, who is well-versed in both ancient and modern knowledge

537
0:20:57,48 --> 0:20:58,78
And has a comprehensive education in both Eastern and Western cultures

538
0:20:58,78 --> 0:21:2,5
His understanding of metaphysics truly surpasses everyone else's

539
0:21:2,5 --> 0:21:4,3
Don't think I make money from this stuff

540
0:21:4,3 --> 0:21:5,82
But in reality

541
0:21:5,82 --> 0:21:8,1
It's his arrangement.

542
0:21:8,1 --> 0:21:9,67
It's very ingenious.

543
0:21:9,67 --> 0:21:13,65
This means that some of your main obstacles are right here.

544
0:21:13,65 --> 0:21:15,45
Once you break through this barrier,

545
0:21:15,45 --> 0:21:17,29
your life will see significant progress.

546
0:21:17,29 --> 0:21:20,23
When you can transcend the ego,

547
0:21:20,23 --> 0:21:21,56
go beyond the self,

548
0:21:21,56 --> 0:21:23,92
and view these issues from this perspective,

549
0:21:23,92 --> 0:21:25,38
some problems will resolve themselves.

550
0:21:25,38 --> 0:21:26,58
it will be resolved effortlessly

551
0:21:26,58 --> 0:21:27,68
often times

552
0:21:27,68 --> 0:21:29,639
it's because you're at this stage of viewing

553
0:21:29,639 --> 0:21:31,139
you're in the emotion

554
0:21:31,139 --> 0:21:32,599
you're in the character

555
0:21:32,599 --> 0:21:34,679
you're in the persona

556
0:21:34,959 --> 0:21:38,3
you're in this MBTI

557
0:21:38,3 --> 0:21:43,639
the influence of these yellow, green, purple, and blue elements on you is too strong

558
0:21:43,639 --> 0:21:46,739
you're too accustomed to playing this role

559
0:21:46,739 --> 0:21:52,5
You're not used to thinking about problems outside of your current state of being.

560
0:21:52,5 --> 0:21:55,51
So, your potential is confined within your physical self.

561
0:21:55,51 --> 0:21:57,51
These issues become unsolvable as a result.

562
0:21:57,51 --> 0:22:0,37
In other words, if you truly want to make money,

563
0:22:0,37 --> 0:22:7,23
you need to align your mental and intellectual levels with those of the top figures.

564
0:22:7,23 --> 0:22:11,59
That's why many of these top figures gradually develop an interest in mysticism.

565
0:22:11,59 --> 0:22:13,67
Whether it's mystic societies,

566
0:22:13,67 --> 0:22:18,259
or unexplained historical events,

567
0:22:18,259 --> 0:22:20,159
they become fascinated by these things.

568
0:22:20,159 --> 0:22:22,139
One is that he has the time to think about it.

569
0:22:22,139 --> 0:22:27,469
Second, he will realize that some of his qualities are not purely coincidental.

570
0:22:27,469 --> 0:22:29,129
The reason people become wealthy,

571
0:22:29,129 --> 0:22:29,849
become famous,

572
0:22:29,849 --> 0:22:31,29
and gain power,

573
0:22:31,29 --> 0:22:34,33
is because they are useful to more people in society.

574
0:22:34,33 --> 0:22:37,73
But this kind of usefulness isn't in the conventional sense.

575
0:22:37,73 --> 0:22:39,29
You understand?

576
0:22:39,73 --> 0:22:42,1
Try to figure out why Brother Rong became popular.

577
0:22:42,1 --> 0:22:44,87
This matter is an inevitable event.

578
0:22:44,87 --> 0:22:50,659
Because his existence has a metaphysical effect on others.

579
0:22:50,659 --> 0:22:51,919
So similarly,

580
0:22:51,919 --> 0:22:54,319
If a state of your life

581
0:22:54,319 --> 0:22:59,7
can serve a large number of people,

582
0:22:59,7 --> 0:23:1,83
your reputation will naturally grow faster.

583
0:23:1,83 --> 0:23:4,889
In other words, if what you offer is useful to others,

584
0:23:4,889 --> 0:23:6,689
nature will naturally lend you a hand.

585
0:23:6,689 --> 0:23:10,76
So how to make yourself more popular

586
0:23:10,76 --> 0:23:11,72
Those with considerable power

587
0:23:11,72 --> 0:23:13,54
and ample financial resources

588
0:23:13,54 --> 0:23:16,65
need to focus on enhancing your spiritual cultivation

589
0:23:16,65 --> 0:23:19,59
I’ve made myself quite clear

590
0:23:19,59 --> 0:23:20,85
can you just not understand

591
0:23:20,85 --> 0:23:22,29
that’s up to you

592
0:23:22,29 --> 0:23:27,31
it’s about how you progress in society

593
0:23:27,31 --> 0:23:32,8
the key is that you are useful to other members of society

594
0:23:33,12 --> 0:23:34,44
how you build good relationships with others

595
0:23:34,44 --> 0:23:35,92
You sleep with everyone

596
0:23:35,92 --> 0:23:37,28
You give money to everyone

597
0:23:37,28 --> 0:23:39,38
You use your power to help everyone

598
0:23:39,38 --> 0:23:41,199
So you have good relationships with everyone

599
0:23:41,199 --> 0:23:43,6
Once you retire

600
0:23:43,6 --> 0:23:44,38
When you're old and less attractive

601
0:23:44,38 --> 0:23:45,54
When you're broke

602
0:23:45,54 --> 0:23:47,16
People naturally drift away from you

603
0:23:47,16 --> 0:23:49,2
But that's how fate works

604
0:23:49,2 --> 0:23:52,28
Once you are of value to others mentally

605
0:23:52,28 --> 0:23:54,36
And useful for their life journey

606
0:23:54,36 --> 0:23:56,4
For some of their

607
0:23:56,4 --> 0:23:58,66
Things that help remove their mental barriers

608
0:23:58,66 --> 0:24:0,94
You will naturally become wealthy

609
0:24:0,94 --> 0:24:1,9
Famous

610
0:24:1,9 --> 0:24:2,86
And influential

611
0:24:2,86 --> 0:24:9,79
This communication is not something that can be explained simply through physical means

612
0:24:9,79 --> 0:24:14,449
In other words, all these things are actually arranged by Steins

613
0:24:14,449 --> 0:24:17,529
The question of which comes first, the cause or the effect

614
0:24:17,529 --> 0:24:20,129
The question of which came first, the chicken or the egg

615
0:24:21,5 --> 0:24:22,56
That's how it is

616
0:24:22,56 --> 0:24:25,88
Which came first, the chicken or the egg

617
0:24:25,88 --> 0:24:28,19
Which comes first, the cause or the effect

618
0:24:28,19 --> 0:24:30,15
Did you go ahead and do it first

619
0:24:30,15 --> 0:24:32,71
Or did it come about because you wanted to do it

620
0:24:32,71 --> 0:24:37,91
Was it that you made the dumplings first to have this vinegar for the meal

621
0:24:37,91 --> 0:24:40,33
Or did you buy the vinegar first for the dumplings

622
0:24:40,33 --> 0:24:41,83
There are so many of these things.

623
0:24:41,83 --> 0:24:44,25
So the things you do,

624
0:24:44,25 --> 0:24:47,219
they lead to different outcomes.

625
0:24:47,219 --> 0:24:49,929
So don't ask about the cause and effect.

626
0:24:49,929 --> 0:24:52,709
You need to combine these elements together.

627
0:24:52,709 --> 0:24:55,76
First, become someone who is useful to society.

628
0:24:55,76 --> 0:24:59,87
Then, resources in society will naturally come your way.

629
0:24:59,87 --> 0:25:3,67
That is to say, if you want to become more capable,

630
0:25:3,67 --> 0:25:7,92
you must enrich your knowledge and expertise.

631
0:25:7,92 --> 0:25:9,96
You need to build up your strength.

632
0:25:9,96 --> 0:25:11,92
To put it simply, it's a straightforward statement.

633
0:25:11,92 --> 0:25:14,34
It's about being someone who contributes to society.

634
0:25:14,34 --> 0:25:16,52
And naturally, the things you need will come to you.

635
0:25:16,52 --> 0:25:18,84
So, in today's context,

636
0:25:18,84 --> 0:25:23,3
what truly benefits you is making more friends,

637
0:25:23,3 --> 0:25:24,17
reading more books,

638
0:25:24,17 --> 0:25:25,55
and exercising more often.

639
0:25:25,55 --> 0:25:27,35
It might sound like a cliché, but it's true.

640
0:25:27,35 --> 0:25:28,51
Actually, to be precise

641
0:25:28,51 --> 0:25:32,8
I've figured out this kind of arrangement in the course of fate

642
0:25:32,8 --> 0:25:35,56
When you are of no use to society

643
0:25:35,56 --> 0:25:37,25
This society will leave you behind

644
0:25:37,25 --> 0:25:39,65
You are useful to other humans

645
0:25:39,65 --> 0:25:42,25
Especially for its significant role in metaphysics

646
0:25:42,25 --> 0:25:44,9
Especially when it comes to the significant role of fate

647
0:25:49,6 --> 0:25:51,929
And these are things you can't see on your own

648
0:25:52,169 --> 0:25:56,15
So, it's about whether you can influence the lives of millions of people

649
0:25:56,15 --> 0:25:58,79
To do something significant

650
0:25:58,79 --> 0:26:0,15
To set long-term goals

651
0:26:0,15 --> 0:26:1,73
This is crucial

652
0:26:1,73 --> 0:26:5,8
All of these are available in the library

653
0:26:5,8 --> 0:26:7,94
Because the library houses books from all over the world

654
0:26:7,94 --> 0:26:9,2
As long as the book is published

655
0:26:9,2 --> 0:26:10,62
The National Library will definitely have it

656
0:26:10,62 --> 0:26:13,679
Including my B station content, it's also in the National Library

657
0:26:13,679 --> 0:26:14,819
So, to speak

658
0:26:14,819 --> 0:26:16,979
as long as you go out and discover

659
0:26:16,979 --> 0:26:18,959
you will find this thing

660
0:26:18,959 --> 0:26:20,459
it's actually a very interesting thing

661
0:26:20,459 --> 0:26:26,59
so, you must never confine yourself to your current knowledge

662
0:26:26,59 --> 0:26:28,95
you can't let people think that life is just like this

663
0:26:28,95 --> 0:26:29,97
I can't afford a Maybach

664
0:26:29,97 --> 0:26:33,73
I can only help others collect Porsche parts

665
0:26:33,73 --> 0:26:34,93
I'm just a lickspittle

666
0:26:34,93 --> 0:26:36,28
I'm just a turtle man

667
0:26:36,28 --> 0:26:39,36
I'm just an unattractive girl

668
0:26:39,36 --> 0:26:40,66
you shouldn't think like that

669
0:26:40,66 --> 0:26:42,21
never think like that

670
0:26:42,21 --> 0:26:44,45
because, in terms of the soul

671
0:26:44,45 --> 0:26:45,97
or at the level of consciousness

672
0:26:45,97 --> 0:26:47,929
everyone is in the same state

673
0:26:47,929 --> 0:26:50,329
it's just that the outer shell is different

674
0:26:50,329 --> 0:26:52,289
the content inside is actually the same

675
0:26:52,289 --> 0:26:53,329
we all have it

676
0:26:53,329 --> 0:26:54,409
how to put it

677
0:26:54,409 --> 0:26:55,89
how to put it

678
0:26:55,89 --> 0:26:55,889
in Buddhist terms

679
0:26:55,889 --> 0:26:57,429
everyone has Buddha-nature, right?

680
0:26:57,429 --> 0:27:0,889
Buddha is the enlightened state that everyone will eventually reach

681
0:27:0,889 --> 0:27:4,14
which means only through continuous learning

682
0:27:4,14 --> 0:27:7,429
continuous learning can strengthen a nation

683
0:27:7,429 --> 0:27:9,449
it's that simple

684
0:27:9,449 --> 0:27:10,629
only through continuous learning

685
0:27:10,629 --> 0:27:11,989
constantly discerning truth from falsehood

686
0:27:11,989 --> 0:27:14,109
constantly refining and purifying

687
0:27:14,109 --> 0:27:16,79
you need to refine and purify these things

688
0:27:16,79 --> 0:27:18,5
so no matter what

689
0:27:18,5 --> 0:27:19,77
there's a golden house in books

690
0:27:19,77 --> 0:27:22,83
everyone should explore more about business

691
0:27:22,83 --> 0:27:27,32
economics, psychology, humanities, and social sciences

692
0:27:27,32 --> 0:27:30,8
it might seem useless on the surface

693
0:27:30,8 --> 0:27:31,68
but it's actually very useful

694
0:27:31,68 --> 0:27:34,96
and I always advise everyone to read the original works

695
0:27:34,96 --> 0:27:36,64
the purpose of these things

696
0:27:36,64 --> 0:27:39,84
is not to use these means to achieve something like in ancient times

697
0:27:39,84 --> 0:27:42,639
but when you learn these things

698
0:27:42,639 --> 0:27:44,439
after you become this state

699
0:27:44,439 --> 0:27:46,459
your relationships will change

700
0:27:46,459 --> 0:27:49,72
your way of thinking will be different

701
0:27:49,72 --> 0:27:52,44
you will meet different people

702
0:27:52,44 --> 0:27:54,2
after meeting different people

703
0:27:54,2 --> 0:27:56,24
your fate will start to change with these different people

704
0:27:56,24 --> 0:28:1,34
in other words, the more you know

705
0:28:1,78 --> 0:28:4,16
the more you do

706
0:28:4,16 --> 0:28:5,78
the more you will be involved in the complex cause-and-effect relationships of society

707
0:28:5,78 --> 0:28:9,97
your law of causality will change

708
0:28:9,97 --> 0:28:12,55
you will no longer be an ordinary person outside of society

709
0:28:12,55 --> 0:28:16,51
but a person within the flow of society

710
0:28:16,51 --> 0:28:18,81
you will have connections with thousands of people

711
0:28:18,81 --> 0:28:21,95
their births, aging, illnesses, and deaths

712
0:28:21,95 --> 0:28:23,39
their rises and falls, honors and disgraces, will all be connected to you

713
0:28:23,39 --> 0:28:25,83
so at this point, you will be lifted up by thousands of people

714
0:28:25,83 --> 0:28:29,15
your life will no longer be entirely your own

715
0:28:29,15 --> 0:28:32,29
you won't worry about survival anymore

716
0:28:32,29 --> 0:28:36,55
someone will always come to you

717
0:28:36,55 --> 0:28:38,37
so, these things

718
0:28:38,37 --> 0:28:39,67
will gradually produce a very positive effect

719
0:28:39,67 --> 0:28:42,6
of course, you will also find that

720
0:28:42,6 --> 0:28:44,18
as a small self

721
0:28:44,18 --> 0:28:45,26
as an ordinary person

722
0:28:45,26 --> 0:28:46,56
your ability to control your life will decrease

723
0:28:46,56 --> 0:28:49,6
but this is precisely because you are connected with thousands of people

724
0:28:49,6 --> 0:28:53,14
it will naturally transfer some control

725
0:28:53,14 --> 0:28:56,84
so this is the core experience of life

726
0:28:56,84 --> 0:29:0,32
how should one live this life

727
0:29:0,32 --> 0:29:2,2
so, everything Brother Rong is telling you today is to live a happy life

728
0:29:2,2 --> 0:29:7,679
to live with goals

729
0:29:7,679 --> 0:29:10,59
to enrich yourself

730
0:29:10,59 --> 0:29:11,78
on the surface, you may feel like you're not doing anything

731
0:29:11,78 --> 0:29:15,28
but the moment that truly changes your fate

732
0:29:15,28 --> 0:29:18,78
when you look back

733
0:29:18,78 --> 0:29:20,62
will seem like an ordinary day at the time

734
0:29:20,62 --> 0:29:23,6
It was just an ordinary day back then.
