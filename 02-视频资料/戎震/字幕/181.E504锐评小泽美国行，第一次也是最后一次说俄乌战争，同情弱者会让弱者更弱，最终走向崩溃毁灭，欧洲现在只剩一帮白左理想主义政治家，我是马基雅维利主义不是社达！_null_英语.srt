1
0:0:0,72 --> 0:0:2,32
This episode is going to be quite exciting.

2
0:0:2,32 --> 0:0:3,38
So please be patient and watch till the end.

3
0:0:3,38 --> 0:0:4,96
It might draw some harsh criticism.

4
0:0:4,96 --> 0:0:7,44
But that’s another reason to stick with it.

5
0:0:7,44 --> 0:0:10,44
What I hate the most are those grand narrative bloggers.

6
0:0:10,44 --> 0:0:13,76
Always bringing up the relations between China, the U.S., and Russia.

7
0:0:13,76 --> 0:0:16,24
All sorts of international influence and whatnot.

8
0:0:16,24 --> 0:0:17,56
What’s the big deal with international politics?

9
0:0:17,56 --> 0:0:19,6
Using that as a gimmick.

10
0:0:19,6 --> 0:0:20,48
Then talking to ordinary people

11
0:0:20,48 --> 0:0:22,44
about a bunch of things irrelevant to their lives

12
0:0:22,44 --> 0:0:24,46
First, let me explain

13
0:0:24,46 --> 0:0:26,74
why I dislike being a grand narrative blogger

14
0:0:26,74 --> 0:0:31,9
because grand narratives can make you lose touch with the core of your life

15
0:0:31,9 --> 0:0:34,689
but today I'm going to be a grand narrative blogger again

16
0:0:34,689 --> 0:0:36,629
I'll talk about Zelenskyy

17
0:0:36,629 --> 0:0:41,66
and his 50-minute ordeal during this negotiation

18
0:0:41,66 --> 0:0:42,18
suffering humiliation

19
0:0:42,18 --> 0:0:43,76
Finally being forced out of the White House

20
0:0:43,76 --> 0:0:44,72
What a tough journey

21
0:0:44,72 --> 0:0:49,14
I rarely discuss the Russia-Ukraine conflict in my videos.

22
0:0:49,14 --> 0:0:51,18
Or the Russian special military operation

23
0:0:51,18 --> 0:0:52,78
Or the Russia-Ukraine war

24
0:0:52,78 --> 0:0:54,18
Regardless

25
0:0:54,18 --> 0:0:59,35
My feelings about this war are very complex

26
0:0:59,35 --> 0:1:2,77
And it has been a very long time

27
0:1:2,77 --> 0:1:4,35
Because I follow him

28
0:1:4,35 --> 0:1:7,3
Since the start of this internal conflict in Ukraine

29
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:9,32
I've already started following him.

30
0:1:9,32 --> 0:1:13,76
And my stance has been in support of Russia

31
0:1:13,76 --> 0:1:16,36
to sympathizing with Ukraine

32
0:1:16,36 --> 0:1:17,94
to being completely neutral

33
0:1:17,94 --> 0:1:20,2
It has gone through three changes

34
0:1:20,2 --> 0:1:23,13
Actually, there's nothing suspicious about it.

35
0:1:23,13 --> 0:1:25,15
Because from the beginning

36
0:1:25,15 --> 0:1:28,7
I've maintained a Machiavellian philosophy

37
0:1:28,7 --> 0:1:32,88
That is, if Xiaoze had really taken the time to study it

38
0:1:32,88 --> 0:1:33,7
Speaking of the prince,

39
0:1:33,7 --> 0:1:36,549
Just like my followers studying the Prince

40
0:1:36,549 --> 0:1:37,689
Putting the prince into practice,

41
0:1:37,689 --> 0:1:40,449
there might not be so many problems now

42
0:1:40,449 --> 0:1:44,63
Some people say Rongzhen, you are just a social climber

43
0:1:44,63 --> 0:1:48,3
you are just promoting the survival of the fittest

44
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:50,5
the law of the jungle

45
0:1:50,5 --> 0:1:54,78
you are just advocating these Machiavellian tactics

46
0:1:54,98 --> 0:1:57,98
Social Darwinism and Machiavellianism

47
0:1:57,98 --> 0:2:0,14
are two entirely different things.

48
0:2:0,14 --> 0:2:2,26
They represent completely different approaches to life.

49
0:2:2,26 --> 0:2:7,9
Social Darwinism refers to the application of Darwinian principles to social and economic issues.

50
0:2:7,9 --> 0:2:9,95
Human society also operates under the law of the jungle.

51
0:2:9,95 --> 0:2:12,45
It's natural for powerful nations to bully weaker ones.

52
0:2:12,45 --> 0:2:13,73
There are all sorts of dynamics at play.

53
0:2:13,73 --> 0:2:16,71
And strong countries eliminate weaker ones as a result.

54
0:2:16,71 --> 0:2:19,1
This can lead to the extermination of weaker nations.

55
0:2:19,1 --> 0:2:20,16
It's only right.

56
0:2:20,16 --> 0:2:21,92
This is called Social Darwinism.

57
0:2:21,92 --> 0:2:24,66
Your superior race will replace the inferior one.

58
0:2:24,66 --> 0:2:25,74
You should listen to it.

59
0:2:25,74 --> 0:2:28,3
This is somewhat similar to Fascism.

60
0:2:28,3 --> 0:2:33,42
But the characteristic of Machiavellianism isn't its pragmatism.

61
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:37,65
The feature of Machiavelli isn't about the survival of the fittest.

62
0:2:37,65 --> 0:2:40,21
Because the survival of the fittest is inherent in politics.

63
0:2:40,21 --> 0:2:42,51
It's a fundamental principle between nations.

64
0:2:42,51 --> 0:2:44,209
It's a law of physics

65
0:2:44,209 --> 0:2:45,689
the weak are bullied

66
0:2:45,689 --> 0:2:46,949
the weak are bullied by the strong

67
0:2:46,949 --> 0:2:49,19
the big eating the small is quite normal

68
0:2:49,47 --> 0:2:51,15
but what is a Machiavellian

69
0:2:51,15 --> 0:2:56,9
Machiavellians primarily deceive others through manipulation

70
0:2:56,9 --> 0:2:59,69
Deceiving oneself to ultimately achieve a pragmatic outcome.

71
0:2:59,69 --> 0:3:0,55
remember this

72
0:3:0,55 --> 0:3:4,329
I admire these historical conspirators

73
0:3:4,329 --> 0:3:5,649
Their reputations aren't great

74
0:3:5,649 --> 0:3:7,69
Machiavelli

75
0:3:7,69 --> 0:3:8,749
Sanada Masayuki

76
0:3:8,749 --> 0:3:9,989
Tokugawa Ieyasu

77
0:3:9,989 --> 0:3:10,849
Sima Yi

78
0:3:10,849 --> 0:3:11,629
Tywin

79
0:3:11,629 --> 0:3:12,69
Jia Xu

80
0:3:12,69 --> 0:3:13,37
These people

81
0:3:13,37 --> 0:3:16,85
Remember, these are the ones who can leverage the small to achieve the great

82
0:3:16,85 --> 0:3:21,47
To achieve the greatest results with the least cost,

83
0:3:21,47 --> 0:3:23,59
If you call me a Machiavellian,

84
0:3:23,59 --> 0:3:24,65
I’ll clap for you,

85
0:3:24,65 --> 0:3:26,23
If you say I'm a social Darwinist

86
0:3:26,23 --> 0:3:26,83
Bro,

87
0:3:26,83 --> 0:3:27,79
You need to read more books.

88
0:3:27,79 --> 0:3:30,18
Is that all you can think of, social Darwinism?

89
0:3:30,18 --> 0:3:31,4
You’re a social Darwinist,

90
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:32,6
You’re a social Darwinist.

91
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:34,22
Is that the only way of thinking?

92
0:3:34,22 --> 0:3:34,66
Right?

93
0:3:34,66 --> 0:3:36,42
You should learn a new word, okay?

94
0:3:36,42 --> 0:3:37,38
The mask of ideology

95
0:3:37,38 --> 0:3:38,31
What is it like?

96
0:3:38,31 --> 0:3:40,89
This is what I've been trying to explain to you

97
0:3:40,89 --> 0:3:43,11
If Xiao Ze

98
0:3:43,11 --> 0:3:44,27
Xiao Zelensky

99
0:3:44,27 --> 0:3:47,13
He is a social Darwinist.

100
0:3:47,13 --> 0:3:49,77
He might not put up any resistance at all

101
0:3:49,77 --> 0:3:51,43
He wouldn't fight back

102
0:3:51,43 --> 0:3:53,75
But I still feel a bit sorry for him

103
0:3:53,75 --> 0:3:54,65
I even admire him a little

104
0:3:54,65 --> 0:3:58,14
After all, he was given the task in an emergency situation.

105
0:3:58,14 --> 0:4:0,94
He held his ground for so long during the war

106
0:4:0,94 --> 0:4:2,26
To start with

107
0:4:2,26 --> 0:4:4,38
I think during Poroshenko's era

108
0:4:4,38 --> 0:4:7,22
There was this kind of civil war oppression in Eastern Ukraine

109
0:4:7,22 --> 0:4:9,6
This is inherently unjust.

110
0:4:9,6 --> 0:4:12,2
Russia, from this perspective,

111
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:14,82
the relationship between the protected and the protector,

112
0:4:14,82 --> 0:4:16,44
does have a justification for military intervention.

113
0:4:16,44 --> 0:4:19,86
But expanding the war to the entire territory of Ukraine,

114
0:4:19,86 --> 0:4:23,34
has led to massive casualties and property damage,

115
0:4:23,34 --> 0:4:27,7
which may not have been what Russia truly intended.

116
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:29,7
But the reality is as it is.

117
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:32,14
You shouldn't assist a weaker party.

118
0:4:32,14 --> 0:4:34,7
Because helping the weak is not the right thing to do.

119
0:4:34,7 --> 0:4:37,87
Helping the weak has never been a right thing to do.

120
0:4:37,87 --> 0:4:39,91
Why is helping the weak not the right thing to do?

121
0:4:39,91 --> 0:4:41,29
Because when you help the weak,

122
0:4:41,29 --> 0:4:42,47
they themselves

123
0:4:42,47 --> 0:4:45,53
won't become strong quickly just because of your help.

124
0:4:45,53 --> 0:4:49,659
Instead, you only make the weak's tragic fate even more tragic.

125
0:4:49,659 --> 0:4:51,59
If we think about it,

126
0:4:51,59 --> 0:4:53,779
if no country had helped Ukraine at the beginning

127
0:4:53,779 --> 0:4:55,999
No one stood by his side

128
0:4:55,999 --> 0:4:57,619
Ukraine would quickly fail, right?

129
0:4:57,619 --> 0:4:59,1
Then sign a humiliating peace treaty

130
0:4:59,1 --> 0:5:0,9
There's a possibility of being completely annexed

131
0:5:0,9 --> 0:5:3,65
There's a chance the east could be annexed

132
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:6,5
But is it possible so many people would die?

133
0:5:6,5 --> 0:5:8,13
Is it possible to lose so much property?

134
0:5:8,13 --> 0:5:10,41
It's not certain that a humiliating peace treaty would be signed

135
0:5:10,41 --> 0:5:11,57
It's possible there wouldn't be so much trouble

136
0:5:11,57 --> 0:5:13,76
But all of this is possible

137
0:5:13,76 --> 0:5:16,94
Once a person doesn't resist a force

138
0:5:16,94 --> 0:5:18,6
Such overwhelming power

139
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:22,5
He ends up possessing these things under others' encouragement

140
0:5:22,5 --> 0:5:23,97
It's like you don't have any weapons yourself

141
0:5:23,97 --> 0:5:25,55
You can't fight off a thug, right?

142
0:5:25,55 --> 0:5:28,39
But now you've been given a bunch of weapons

143
0:5:28,39 --> 0:5:29,55
You can take on the thug

144
0:5:29,55 --> 0:5:30,71
But the issue is

145
0:5:30,71 --> 0:5:34,12
The person who gives you a weapon hopes you will defeat the bully

146
0:5:34,12 --> 0:5:36,99
or does he hope you will perish together with the bully?

147
0:5:36,99 --> 0:5:38,33
That's the question.

148
0:5:38,33 --> 0:5:39,99
Are you the dish on the table?

149
0:5:39,99 --> 0:5:43,48
Or do they act out of a simple sense of heroism,

150
0:5:43,48 --> 0:5:45,38
a desire to stand up to the strong and help the weak?

151
0:5:45,38 --> 0:5:47,2
I believe in Europe,

152
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:48,4
Today's statesmen

153
0:5:48,4 --> 0:5:52,39
many of them are driven by a desire to stand up to the strong and help the weak.

154
0:5:52,39 --> 0:5:53,199
This is great.

155
0:5:53,199 --> 0:5:54,399
They are idealists.

156
0:5:54,399 --> 0:5:58,27
But the last thing idealists should do is get involved in politics.

157
0:5:58,27 --> 0:6:0,89
Because politics is a complex business.

158
0:6:0,89 --> 0:6:2,92
Politics demands the most cunning.

159
0:6:2,92 --> 0:6:4,38
The most devious.

160
0:6:4,38 --> 0:6:5,6
The darkest tactics.

161
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:6,9
And the blackest hearts.

162
0:6:6,9 --> 0:6:9,22
There are no moral boundaries whatsoever.

163
0:6:9,22 --> 0:6:12,24
A person without any moral restraints going into politics

164
0:6:12,24 --> 0:6:14,72
This is the attitude a statesman should have.

165
0:6:14,72 --> 0:6:18,37
The reason I dislike everyone getting into grand narratives is

166
0:6:18,37 --> 0:6:20,87
is because in my limited life experience,

167
0:6:20,87 --> 0:6:23,21
I've come to realize many things.

168
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:26,13
Our society has a lot of very capable people,

169
0:6:26,13 --> 0:6:27,55
very talented individuals.

170
0:6:27,55 --> 0:6:28,51
These people,

171
0:6:28,51 --> 0:6:31,77
believe me, in the context of Chinese history,

172
0:6:31,77 --> 0:6:33,57
any exceptionally powerful

173
0:6:33,57 --> 0:6:34,57
highly intelligent

174
0:6:34,57 --> 0:6:35,53
extremely wise

175
0:6:35,53 --> 0:6:36,1
these individuals

176
0:6:36,1 --> 0:6:38,77
are certainly on the forefront of the nation

177
0:6:38,77 --> 0:6:41,49
these people have more conscience than I do

178
0:6:41,49 --> 0:6:43,3
more insight than I do

179
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:44,33
more perseverance than I do

180
0:6:44,33 --> 0:6:45,79
more strategic resolve than I do

181
0:6:45,79 --> 0:6:47,38
You don't have to go.

182
0:6:47,38 --> 0:6:48,96
Don't worry about what I said.

183
0:6:48,96 --> 0:6:51,64
But I will compare you to them.

184
0:6:51,64 --> 0:6:52,7
These people,

185
0:6:52,7 --> 0:6:55,8
the ones who truly decide the future of the country, are not confused at all.

186
0:6:55,8 --> 0:6:57,909
And they are not as unscrupulous as I am.

187
0:6:57,909 --> 0:7:0,29
So there's no need for you to worry.

188
0:7:0,29 --> 0:7:1,69
There's no need to worry.

189
0:7:1,69 --> 0:7:4,389
If the world were full of people as unscrupulous as me,

190
0:7:4,389 --> 0:7:7,53
If Machiavellians were to control the big picture,

191
0:7:7,53 --> 0:7:8,39
let me tell you,

192
0:7:8,39 --> 0:7:10,15
the world would become incredibly interesting.

193
0:7:10,15 --> 0:7:11,63
Primarily because,

194
0:7:11,63 --> 0:7:15,34
The mindset of social Darwinists is predatory.

195
0:7:15,34 --> 0:7:16,4
aggressive,

196
0:7:16,4 --> 0:7:19,88
while Machiavellians are mainly about deception,

197
0:7:19,88 --> 0:7:21,7
sneaking attacks and trickery,

198
0:7:21,7 --> 0:7:23,58
achieving maximum benefits with minimal costs.

199
0:7:23,58 --> 0:7:26,61
This is the core of being a Marxist.

200
0:7:26,61 --> 0:7:29,57
So, if I were Ozawa, what would I do?

201
0:7:29,57 --> 0:7:32,65
I would tell Vance and Trump this.

202
0:7:32,65 --> 0:7:35,79
I would really talk it up, make it sound fantastic.

203
0:7:35,79 --> 0:7:38,9
And I would agree to all their demands.

204
0:7:38,9 --> 0:7:41,78
But at the same time, I would reach out to Russia myself.

205
0:7:41,78 --> 0:7:43,94
I would also talk it up, make it sound fantastic.

206
0:7:43,94 --> 0:7:45,76
Then I would agree to all their demands.

207
0:7:45,76 --> 0:7:48,62
The most important thing would be to play one against the other.

208
0:7:48,62 --> 0:7:50,12
One woman married to two men

209
0:7:50,12 --> 0:7:51,51
Got it?

210
0:7:52,729 --> 0:7:54,999
I want the original work

211
0:7:54,999 --> 0:7:56,639
I want military aid

212
0:7:56,639 --> 0:7:58,499
I need the reconstruction funds, right?

213
0:7:58,499 --> 0:8:3,17
But you see, I’m negotiating with Russia, and both sides are greedy

214
0:8:3,17 --> 0:8:5,53
So let them compete for a mine

215
0:8:5,53 --> 0:8:7,69
Sell the same deal to both sides, one woman married to two men

216
0:8:7,69 --> 0:8:8,34
Right?

217
0:8:8,34 --> 0:8:11,6
The most important thing is what actual benefits I can get.

218
0:8:11,6 --> 0:8:13,0
I know you can't keep going now.

219
0:8:13,0 --> 0:8:15,38
You guys also hope I bleed more, right?

220
0:8:15,38 --> 0:8:16,84
Some people want you to bleed more.

221
0:8:16,84 --> 0:8:18,6
But in this situation,

222
0:8:18,6 --> 0:8:21,68
Actually, those European politicians are the most damn incompetent bunch of people.

223
0:8:21,68 --> 0:8:24,96
Because whether you're a Machiavellian,

224
0:8:24,96 --> 0:8:26,18
Pragmatism

225
0:8:26,18 --> 0:8:27,42
like Trump.

226
0:8:27,42 --> 0:8:28,2
Wan Si

227
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:30,539
Actually, they have a typical businessman’s mindset.

228
0:8:30,539 --> 0:8:34,409
This mindset is also characteristic of Machiavellianism.

229
0:8:34,409 --> 0:8:37,329
It's not just a form of egoism

230
0:8:37,329 --> 0:8:42,1
It's more of a philosophy of pragmatism and ethics.

231
0:8:42,33 --> 0:8:44,95
Practicality trumps everything else.

232
0:8:44,95 --> 0:8:46,1
There’s no morality at all.

233
0:8:46,1 --> 0:8:47,89
They may talk about ethics,

234
0:8:47,89 --> 0:8:49,37
but in reality, there’s no morality.

235
0:8:49,37 --> 0:8:51,48
This is a characteristic of Magawist ideology.

236
0:8:51,48 --> 0:8:53,86
These Europeans are idealists.

237
0:8:53,86 --> 0:8:55,36
I’m the one who will support whoever is invaded.

238
0:8:55,36 --> 0:8:56,46
I will offer them support.

239
0:8:56,46 --> 0:8:59,16
But there’s also a bit of selfishness involved.

240
0:8:59,16 --> 0:9:0,67
Let them be the ones to die.

241
0:9:0,67 --> 0:9:2,35
Let the fighting happen on their territory.

242
0:9:2,35 --> 0:9:4,91
It’s better than me having to make any real sacrifices.

243
0:9:4,91 --> 0:9:5,75
Right, isn’t it?

244
0:9:5,75 --> 0:9:6,99
Then I'll send the troops

245
0:9:6,99 --> 0:9:8,89
I'll send military personnel as volunteers

246
0:9:8,89 --> 0:9:10,41
I'll send the weapons

247
0:9:10,41 --> 0:9:13,17
I'll send all kinds of experts and personnel

248
0:9:13,17 --> 0:9:15,21
This way, I minimize my losses while inflicting casualties on him

249
0:9:15,21 --> 0:9:16,55
I'll support him morally

250
0:9:16,55 --> 0:9:17,59
That's a petty calculation

251
0:9:17,59 --> 0:9:18,39
Speaking of Russia

252
0:9:18,39 --> 0:9:19,43
To put it bluntly, it's about not backing down

253
0:9:19,43 --> 0:9:20,74
Let's just do it.

254
0:9:20,74 --> 0:9:22,6
Russia only has two allies.

255
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:22,82
One is the Air Force.

256
0:9:22,82 --> 0:9:23,74
The other is the Navy, right?

257
0:9:23,74 --> 0:9:24,46
The other is the Navy.

258
0:9:24,46 --> 0:9:25,38
One is the Army.

259
0:9:25,38 --> 0:9:26,78
No matter what.

260
0:9:26,78 --> 0:9:28,72
Russia is a typical example of this.

261
0:9:28,72 --> 0:9:30,14
It doesn't have much power now.

262
0:9:30,14 --> 0:9:31,42
Not knowing how to keep a low profile

263
0:9:31,42 --> 0:9:33,9
The treasury in Kulun is left with nothing but mouse droppings

264
0:9:33,9 --> 0:9:35,3
And they still wage war recklessly

265
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:37,36
So when we talk about Russia, it’s Russia

266
0:9:37,36 --> 0:9:38,79
China is China

267
0:9:38,79 --> 0:9:43,23
China is a country with a 5000-year history of civilization.

268
0:9:43,23 --> 0:9:46,18
And it’s only been 15 years

269
0:9:46,18 --> 0:9:49,42
The longest period of peace has only been 15 years for this country

270
0:9:49,42 --> 0:9:52,2
Our country, the longest period has been roughly that

271
0:9:52,2 --> 0:9:53,8
How to put it,

272
0:9:53,8 --> 0:9:58,43
For the most part, we've been at war for thousands of years,

273
0:9:58,43 --> 0:10:2,4
Peaceful times have been few and far between.

274
0:10:2,4 --> 0:10:6,4
But today, we leverage our strategic advantages

275
0:10:6,4 --> 0:10:9,25
to replace tactical victories.

276
0:10:9,25 --> 0:10:11,84
It's truly a smart and effective move.

277
0:10:11,84 --> 0:10:13,96
It’s about winning without fighting.

278
0:10:13,96 --> 0:10:16,12
This is the pinnacle of Machiavellianism.

279
0:10:16,12 --> 0:10:19,79
Winning without fighting is the ultimate goal.

280
0:10:19,79 --> 0:10:20,799
Ideally, not a single soldier would be lost

281
0:10:20,799 --> 0:10:21,879
yet the issue would be resolved

282
0:10:21,879 --> 0:10:23,139
and our strength would increase

283
0:10:23,139 --> 0:10:24,639
So, in the current situation

284
0:10:24,639 --> 0:10:26,81
these European countries

285
0:10:26,81 --> 0:10:29,33
with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine

286
0:10:29,33 --> 0:10:31,21
the U.S. is now building up its military

287
0:10:31,21 --> 0:10:31,93
and has stepped in

288
0:10:31,93 --> 0:10:34,13
This, in turn, affects all these matters

289
0:10:34,13 --> 0:10:35,35
This is the most beneficial for us

290
0:10:35,35 --> 0:10:36,91
So when you say I'm a social Darwinist

291
0:10:36,91 --> 0:10:39,55
I really don't find it meaningful

292
0:10:39,55 --> 0:10:41,69
Because I'm a thorough Machiavellian

293
0:10:41,69 --> 0:10:43,21
Remember, as a Machiavellian

294
0:10:43,21 --> 0:10:46,349
You can speak freely

295
0:10:46,349 --> 0:10:49,389
The purpose of speaking is to make the other person happy

296
0:10:49,389 --> 0:10:51,69
It's to gain practical benefits

297
0:10:51,69 --> 0:10:54,5
Since Trump can offer you these things

298
0:10:54,29 --> 0:10:55,77
If you can offer something genuine

299
0:10:55,77 --> 0:10:58,29
you should do a favor for him

300
0:10:58,57 --> 0:11:3,21
because you don't have to do what you promised immediately, right?

301
0:11:3,21 --> 0:11:5,21
You promised him a mine, didn't you?

302
0:11:5,21 --> 0:11:7,13
The mine was taken by Russia, wasn't it?

303
0:11:7,13 --> 0:11:8,25
I couldn't defend it

304
0:11:8,25 --> 0:11:9,27
so I gave it to you

305
0:11:9,27 --> 0:11:10,24
Isn't that right?

306
0:11:10,24 --> 0:11:12,1
Can a woman be married to two men at the same time?

307
0:11:12,1 --> 0:11:14,16
It's real money that's brought back.

308
0:11:14,16 --> 0:11:16,32
To put it bluntly, you need to figure out Trump's mindset.

309
0:11:16,32 --> 0:11:18,9
He believes that Biden's promises no longer count.

310
0:11:18,9 --> 0:11:20,34
There's a new person in charge now.

311
0:11:20,34 --> 0:11:21,46
I feel like I'm spending too much now.

312
0:11:21,46 --> 0:11:22,94
I don't want to manage things over there anymore.

313
0:11:22,94 --> 0:11:24,2
Give Russia a favor.

314
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:25,82
I'll just keep harvesting your resources.

315
0:11:25,82 --> 0:11:27,94
You know very well that's his plan.

316
0:11:27,94 --> 0:11:29,94
But now you're the pawn

317
0:11:29,94 --> 0:11:31,54
You're not the player on the board

318
0:11:31,54 --> 0:11:32,52
You're just a pawn

319
0:11:32,52 --> 0:11:35,87
A pawn needs to find ways to be traded as many times as possible

320
0:11:35,87 --> 0:11:38,77
Make everyone feel like you're their pawn

321
0:11:38,77 --> 0:11:40,29
That you're speaking for their interests

322
0:11:40,29 --> 0:11:41,95
So in many cases

323
0:11:41,95 --> 0:11:44,22
The cards in his hand are really few

324
0:11:44,22 --> 0:11:46,66
Trump, to put it bluntly, is making a big sacrifice

325
0:11:46,66 --> 0:11:48,62
He can see these things very clearly.

326
0:11:48,62 --> 0:11:50,34
You feel like you have no cards left to play.

327
0:11:50,34 --> 0:11:52,16
This was the food on the table from the start.

328
0:11:52,16 --> 0:11:53,64
What leverage do you have for negotiation?

329
0:11:53,64 --> 0:11:55,28
I’ve been very clear with you.

330
0:11:55,28 --> 0:11:56,44
Since you’re not giving me any face,

331
0:11:56,44 --> 0:11:57,579
I won’t give you any face either.

332
0:11:57,579 --> 0:11:59,659
Actually, you can play alone.

333
0:11:59,659 --> 0:12:1,459
You can pretend to do a better job.

334
0:12:1,459 --> 0:12:2,859
You're clearly Zelensky

335
0:12:2,859 --> 0:12:3,579
You're an actor

336
0:12:3,579 --> 0:12:7,819
But these political actors are much more skilled than you

337
0:12:8,339 --> 0:12:10,339
What is the most valuable

338
0:12:10,339 --> 0:12:12,18
It's the hand that's hard to extend

339
0:12:12,18 --> 0:12:14,26
A hand that's easy to extend is worthless

340
0:12:14,26 --> 0:12:17,12
You suddenly decide to fly to Moscow to meet Putin

341
0:12:17,12 --> 0:12:18,98
Or somehow mediate between them

342
0:12:18,98 --> 0:12:20,9
That's when you get to the table

343
0:12:20,9 --> 0:12:21,74
Did you know?

344
0:12:21,74 --> 0:12:23,62
If you go and talk to the U.S. now,

345
0:12:23,62 --> 0:12:24,54
and then go and talk to Europe,

346
0:12:24,54 --> 0:12:27,329
and go and talk to those who are slaves to the slave masters,

347
0:12:27,329 --> 0:12:28,929
it's they who will provide you with weapons,

348
0:12:28,929 --> 0:12:30,449
it's they who will bear more of the costs,

349
0:12:30,449 --> 0:12:30,849
and then,

350
0:12:30,849 --> 0:12:32,64
the war will continue,

351
0:12:33,8 --> 0:12:36,8
what you truly exhaust is your population resources.

352
0:12:36,8 --> 0:12:38,28
Engaging in a resource and population drain with Russia

353
0:12:38,28 --> 0:12:42,2
None of you have a substantial manpower advantage

354
0:12:42,2 --> 0:12:43,94
If your demographic structure collapses

355
0:12:43,94 --> 0:12:45,26
Your country ceases to exist

356
0:12:45,26 --> 0:12:46,43
The territory remains

357
0:12:46,43 --> 0:12:47,83
But if the demographic structure collapses

358
0:12:47,83 --> 0:12:48,75
You cease to exist as well

359
0:12:48,75 --> 0:12:50,19
The nation's assets are gone

360
0:12:50,19 --> 0:12:51,75
These countries would no longer exist

361
0:12:51,75 --> 0:12:52,83
The country's territory is gone.

362
0:12:52,83 --> 0:12:53,91
Your country no longer exists.

363
0:12:53,91 --> 0:12:56,185
To put it bluntly, you're now just a piece on the plate.

364
0:12:56,549 --> 0:12:59,709
So, from the very beginning, when we talk about it,

365
0:12:59,709 --> 0:13:2,609
We're talking about the shift from Ukraine to anti-Russian sentiment.

366
0:13:2,609 --> 0:13:6,1
The shift towards ethnic conflict from the start.

367
0:13:6,1 --> 0:13:9,26
So, going back to the earliest days of Yushchenko's era,

368
0:13:9,26 --> 0:13:12,69
And even further back to the Orange Revolution, regardless of how it played out,

369
0:13:12,69 --> 0:13:15,59
So, if you look at Ukraine's history today,

370
0:13:15,59 --> 0:13:18,4
He has always been such a figure.

371
0:13:18,4 --> 0:13:20,28
Used back and forth by several major forces.

372
0:13:20,28 --> 0:13:22,72
Let's not talk about Ukraine's early history.

373
0:13:22,72 --> 0:13:24,14
Just talking about the Black Army.

374
0:13:24,14 --> 0:13:26,2
And the Red Army.

375
0:13:26,2 --> 0:13:27,28
Is there also the White Army?

376
0:13:27,28 --> 0:13:30,38
There was a place where four armies—the Blue, Black, Red, and White—clashed.

377
0:13:30,38 --> 0:13:32,22
Russia stormed into Crimea.

378
0:13:32,22 --> 0:13:34,25
Regardless of the stance taken by Russia.

379
0:13:34,25 --> 0:13:35,49
From the Soviet Union's perspective

380
0:13:35,49 --> 0:13:36,77
or from the standpoint of Ukrainian nationalists

381
0:13:36,77 --> 0:13:38,77
the issue of Ukraine's shifting alliances

382
0:13:38,77 --> 0:13:41,57
has also been quite frequent

383
0:13:41,57 --> 0:13:42,79
which makes its history incredibly complex

384
0:13:42,79 --> 0:13:46,23
Of course

385
0:13:46,23 --> 0:13:46,99
we respect the territorial integrity of all countries

386
0:13:46,99 --> 0:13:49,79
This is a fundamental policy of our country

387
0:13:51,7 --> 0:13:51,83
This is quite normal.

388
0:13:51,83 --> 0:13:54,3
But from their perspective,

389
0:13:54,3 --> 0:13:55,11
To be honest,

390
0:13:55,11 --> 0:13:57,19
they are willing to be used by Europe,

391
0:13:57,19 --> 0:13:59,66
as a pawn in their game.

392
0:13:59,66 --> 0:14:0,28
To be honest,

393
0:14:0,28 --> 0:14:3,28
I've always thought that Eastern Europeans are not very smart.

394
0:14:3,28 --> 0:14:5,9
Most Eastern Europeans are farmers,

395
0:14:5,9 --> 0:14:9,72
so there aren't as many big businessmen among them.

396
0:14:9,72 --> 0:14:11,68
Great philosophers

397
0:14:11,68 --> 0:14:14,83
eminent scholars, or how should I put it

398
0:14:14,83 --> 0:14:18,45
many of those scientists ended up in Western Europe

399
0:14:18,45 --> 0:14:20,95
or in the United States, Berlin, and so on

400
0:14:20,95 --> 0:14:21,85
not Zelensky

401
0:14:21,85 --> 0:14:22,87
Madame Curie and the like

402
0:14:22,87 --> 0:14:23,96
many people followed this path

403
0:14:23,96 --> 0:14:26,14
or became prominent after living in London

404
0:14:26,14 --> 0:14:27,2
to be precise

405
0:14:27,2 --> 0:14:29,7
Eastern Europe doesn't produce a lot of such talents.

406
0:14:29,7 --> 0:14:31,4
It lacks the environment for that.

407
0:14:31,4 --> 0:14:32,48
Maybe it's just my limited experience.

408
0:14:32,48 --> 0:14:35,12
Anyway, I haven't seen any great statesmen emerge from there.

409
0:14:35,12 --> 0:14:39,47
We won't talk about figures like Lenin or Stalin.

410
0:14:39,47 --> 0:14:40,99
Corn tycoon.

411
0:14:40,99 --> 0:14:45,28
There are certain things we can discuss about them.

412
0:14:45,28 --> 0:14:47,52
Politics requires a certain level of foundation.

413
0:14:47,52 --> 0:14:50,4
What kind of country is likely to produce great statesmen?

414
0:14:50,4 --> 0:14:51,85
Russia

415
0:14:51,85 --> 0:14:53,47
the UK and France

416
0:14:53,47 --> 0:14:54,15
Germany

417
0:14:54,15 --> 0:14:54,87
the United States

418
0:14:54,87 --> 0:14:57,7
China is prone to producing great statesmen.

419
0:14:57,7 --> 0:14:59,86
Japan rarely produces great statesmen

420
0:14:59,86 --> 0:15:1,26
because its territory is so limited

421
0:15:1,26 --> 0:15:2,2
its mindset

422
0:15:2,2 --> 0:15:4,75
its history and available references are also limited

423
0:15:4,75 --> 0:15:5,89
So, I want to share with everyone

424
0:15:5,89 --> 0:15:7,35
Statesmen who have read The Prince

425
0:15:7,35 --> 0:15:9,57
Unlike a statesman who hasn't read The Prince

426
0:15:9,57 --> 0:15:11,35
And the common people who have read The Prince

427
0:15:11,35 --> 0:15:13,5
become harder to govern

428
0:15:13,5 --> 0:15:15,86
because you understand the essence of politics

429
0:15:15,86 --> 0:15:18,28
the core of politics is often deception

430
0:15:18,28 --> 0:15:19,4
to put it nicely

431
0:15:19,4 --> 0:15:21,99
and then they deny what they've done

432
0:15:21,99 --> 0:15:22,67
No reconciliation

433
0:15:22,67 --> 0:15:23,95
You can sell it to him

434
0:15:23,95 --> 0:15:25,41
Then you can change your mind

435
0:15:25,41 --> 0:15:26,99
You can sell him some items

436
0:15:26,99 --> 0:15:27,95
Things he wants

437
0:15:27,95 --> 0:15:29,19
Then drag it out

438
0:15:29,19 --> 0:15:31,95
Then switch to someone else to handle it

439
0:15:31,95 --> 0:15:32,53
Right?

440
0:15:32,53 --> 0:15:34,19
The previous government's matters are left undone

441
0:15:34,19 --> 0:15:37,4
So he has a lot of options to counter with.

442
0:15:37,4 --> 0:15:39,56
Small players have their own methods.

443
0:15:39,56 --> 0:15:42,48
Big players have a variety of strategies.

444
0:15:42,48 --> 0:15:43,6
Right?

445
0:15:43,6 --> 0:15:45,53
You have so many mine layers to use.

446
0:15:45,53 --> 0:15:46,63
Right?

447
0:15:46,63 --> 0:15:47,89
Buy your assets.

448
0:15:47,89 --> 0:15:51,0
OK, I can contaminate it.

449
0:15:51,0 --> 0:15:53,12
I can pick up the radioactive materials.

450
0:15:53,12 --> 0:15:53,52
Is that right?

451
0:15:53,52 --> 0:15:54,96
There are so many things we can do.

452
0:15:54,96 --> 0:15:56,28
You can, but I can't.

453
0:15:56,28 --> 0:15:57,32
Neither can others.

454
0:15:57,32 --> 0:15:59,18
So, in many cases,

455
0:15:59,72 --> 0:16:3,45
Your country has plenty of such harmful tactics.

456
0:16:3,45 --> 0:16:4,61
Now, let me tell you,

457
0:16:4,61 --> 0:16:6,49
Does Poland have territorial claims against you?

458
0:16:6,49 --> 0:16:8,99
Don't other countries have territorial claims against you as well?

459
0:16:8,99 --> 0:16:10,27
You take a bit from the east

460
0:16:10,27 --> 0:16:10,83
and a bit from the west

461
0:16:10,83 --> 0:16:12,55
and in the end, you find yourself to be nothing

462
0:16:12,55 --> 0:16:13,99
That's why a weak country has no diplomacy

463
0:16:13,99 --> 0:16:16,55
So we say what Comrade Ozawa did worst

464
0:16:16,55 --> 0:16:18,74
was violating the fundamental principles of politics

465
0:16:18,74 --> 0:16:20,2
He didn't grasp them

466
0:16:20,2 --> 0:16:21,34
In this situation

467
0:16:21,34 --> 0:16:23,32
not giving face to the ruler of a superior state

468
0:16:23,32 --> 0:16:26,6
This will only lead to more problems.

469
0:16:26,6 --> 0:16:28,44
You have so many people.

470
0:16:28,44 --> 0:16:31,7
Think about what you can provide for them.

471
0:16:31,7 --> 0:16:33,66
But they all dare not provoke the U.S.

472
0:16:33,66 --> 0:16:36,6
Between the U.S. and Russia, you can only follow one.

473
0:16:36,6 --> 0:16:37,18
Since you've chosen Russia,

474
0:16:37,18 --> 0:16:38,569
you have to stand against the U.S.

475
0:16:38,569 --> 0:16:39,129
Right?

476
0:16:39,129 --> 0:16:40,169
You are opposing the U.S. with Russia.

477
0:16:40,169 --> 0:16:42,129
You should be a bit nicer to the U.S.

478
0:16:42,129 --> 0:16:43,729
Or do you have another big brother?

479
0:16:43,729 --> 0:16:44,189
Right?

480
0:16:44,189 --> 0:16:47,16
You have another big brother who has hinted at this multiple times,

481
0:16:47,16 --> 0:16:49,32
Actually, he can ensure your safety.

482
0:16:49,32 --> 0:16:51,48
Seeking help from this big brother is the most effective approach.

483
0:16:51,48 --> 0:16:52,96
Because he has a good rapport with Russia.

484
0:16:52,96 --> 0:16:55,6
But you abandoned this strategy.

485
0:16:55,84 --> 0:16:57,8
You then felt that

486
0:16:57,8 --> 0:16:57,88
So, how about that?

487
0:16:57,88 --> 0:16:58,8
Whoever supports me

488
0:16:58,8 --> 0:17:1,2
So you're going to support those people on the other side, right?

489
0:17:1,2 --> 0:17:2,92
This is where you're being unwise.

490
0:17:2,92 --> 0:17:5,27
You haven't fully grasped international politics.

491
0:17:5,27 --> 0:17:7,31
Your thinking is too Westernized.

492
0:17:7,31 --> 0:17:8,67
You're too Europeanized.

493
0:17:8,67 --> 0:17:10,47
You're too Eurocentric.

494
0:17:10,47 --> 0:17:13,5
You're too focused on the world, how to put it...

495
0:17:13,5 --> 0:17:15,1
On the side of fairness and justice

496
0:17:15,1 --> 0:17:18,92
The true power of the world is in the hands of the few

497
0:17:18,92 --> 0:17:20,62
Above all, it's about strength

498
0:17:20,62 --> 0:17:23,0
The methods of Shida are absolutely correct

499
0:17:23,0 --> 0:17:25,42
But in international politics, strength prevails

500
0:17:25,42 --> 0:17:27,3
What comes above strength?

501
0:17:27,3 --> 0:17:28,88
It's the intrigues and schemes

502
0:17:28,88 --> 0:17:30,94
It's all about the vertical and horizontal alliances.

503
0:17:30,94 --> 0:17:33,36
On the surface, it's just a show

504
0:17:33,36 --> 0:17:36,53
Under the bridge, they're secretly tripping people's legs.

505
0:17:36,53 --> 0:17:37,65
On the surface, they're shaking hands.

506
0:17:37,65 --> 0:17:39,17
Under the table, they're kicking others' chairs.

507
0:17:39,17 --> 0:17:40,49
That's the kind of thing they do.

508
0:17:41,49 --> 0:17:42,5
They say they won't do it.

509
0:17:42,5 --> 0:17:42,79
But they do it without saying.

510
0:17:42,79 --> 0:17:43,99
They speak sweet words.

511
0:17:43,99 --> 0:17:45,29
But they do the dirtiest deeds.

512
0:17:45,29 --> 0:17:46,68
This is politics.

513
0:17:46,68 --> 0:17:48,4
Speak the softest words

514
0:17:48,4 --> 0:17:49,36
Do the hardest things

515
0:17:49,36 --> 0:17:51,25
This is politics too

516
0:17:51,61 --> 0:17:52,97
Speak the hardest words

517
0:17:52,97 --> 0:17:54,25
And then do the softest things

518
0:17:54,25 --> 0:17:55,73
Bow and apologize behind people's backs

519
0:17:55,73 --> 0:17:56,73
This is also politics

520
0:17:56,73 --> 0:17:59,59
So politics is definitely for high-IQ individuals

521
0:17:59,59 --> 0:18:1,49
Certainly for those who can control their emotions

522
0:18:1,49 --> 0:18:3,1
It must be someone who can put aside their pride

523
0:18:3,1 --> 0:18:8,0
It must be something only a person without a sense of morality or shame would do

524
0:18:8,32 --> 0:18:10,16
In many cases

525
0:18:10,16 --> 0:18:11,6
a person believes

526
0:18:11,6 --> 0:18:14,4
you have to deal with many people

527
0:18:14,4 --> 0:18:17,2
I'm unwilling to let them get entangled in grand narratives

528
0:18:17,2 --> 0:18:19,32
because getting entangled in grand narratives for you

529
0:18:19,32 --> 0:18:21,52
has no practical value in reality

530
0:18:21,52 --> 0:18:23,4
it has no practical value in reality

531
0:18:23,4 --> 0:18:24,82
And your mind

532
0:18:24,82 --> 0:18:28,229
Most of your mind is that of a child

533
0:18:28,229 --> 0:18:29,549
It falls under the Peter Pan effect

534
0:18:29,549 --> 0:18:30,229
Childlike mind

535
0:18:30,229 --> 0:18:33,89
You haven't really grasped the adult world

536
0:18:33,89 --> 0:18:36,3
So tolerance is crucial

537
0:18:36,3 --> 0:18:37,58
What exactly is it

538
0:18:37,58 --> 0:18:39,66
I see him like my dad

539
0:18:39,66 --> 0:18:40,7
So that's how it is

540
0:18:40,7 --> 0:18:42,58
You don't understand what it means to let go.

541
0:18:42,58 --> 0:18:44,16
And you really dislike making big sacrifices.

542
0:18:44,16 --> 0:18:46,45
Then who can offer you protection?

543
0:18:46,45 --> 0:18:48,53
Who can provide you with crucial help?

544
0:18:48,53 --> 0:18:50,75
So, what about the idealist? What are they supposed to do?

545
0:18:50,75 --> 0:18:53,43
Can you solve most of the world's problems?

546
0:18:53,43 --> 0:18:54,63
Can you stand up to the punk?

547
0:18:54,63 --> 0:18:56,6
Can you stand up to your neighbor Old Wang?

548
0:18:56,6 --> 0:18:58,9
Can you stand up to the thugs with thick arms and legs?

549
0:18:58,9 --> 0:18:59,68
You can't outdo it

550
0:18:59,68 --> 0:19:1,3
So, when talking about it

551
0:19:1,3 --> 0:19:2,87
if you truly want to possess wisdom

552
0:19:2,87 --> 0:19:4,5
if you want to take down the giant

553
0:19:4,5 --> 0:19:6,5
you have to embrace Marxist ideology

554
0:19:6,5 --> 0:19:7,41
What is Marxist ideology?

555
0:19:7,41 --> 0:19:8,93
start by studying it thoroughly

556
0:19:8,93 --> 0:19:11,45
First, read through 'the prince' thoroughly.

557
0:19:11,45 --> 0:19:14,5
don't always rely on your Peter Pan effect

558
0:19:14,5 --> 0:19:18,67
That post-adolescent, postmodern sense of self-respect

559
0:19:18,67 --> 0:19:21,1
The naive, romantic idealism of a bohemian

560
0:19:21,1 --> 0:19:22,99
Coupled with the foolishness of an idealist

561
0:19:22,99 --> 0:19:25,5
Thinking you can also play politics

562
0:19:25,5 --> 0:19:27,17
Don't do this kind of thing

563
0:19:27,17 --> 0:19:28,37
Don't do this

564
0:19:28,37 --> 0:19:30,49
Politics isn't a game for you brain-dead people

565
0:19:30,49 --> 0:19:31,29
There are truly smart

566
0:19:31,29 --> 0:19:34,88
Truly ruthless, people who are blacker than their faces

567
0:19:34,88 --> 0:19:38,82
You have to believe that in our vast country

568
0:19:38,82 --> 0:19:40,82
there are all kinds of powerful talents

569
0:19:40,82 --> 0:19:43,3
and these people have been working behind the scenes

570
0:19:43,3 --> 0:19:44,6
How should I put it

571
0:19:44,6 --> 0:19:44,88
Well, let me think

572
0:19:44,88 --> 0:19:47,17
there's no need for you to worry about it

573
0:19:47,17 --> 0:19:49,13
there's no need to worry on behalf of everyone

574
0:19:49,13 --> 0:19:50,41
You think it's a good thing, don't you

575
0:19:50,41 --> 0:19:53,21
but I'm not part of this wise think tank

576
0:19:53,21 --> 0:19:54,28
What should we do about this?

577
0:19:54,28 --> 0:19:56,76
Without me, this country wouldn't be able to function, would it?

578
0:19:56,76 --> 0:19:57,36
Don't worry.

579
0:19:57,36 --> 0:19:59,2
There are people much more capable than you.

580
0:19:59,2 --> 0:20:2,39
They've already started making their moves long ago.

581
0:20:2,39 --> 0:20:3,59
So you don't need to worry.

582
0:20:3,59 --> 0:20:5,53
I'm just the one who came out to say these things.

583
0:20:5,53 --> 0:20:8,63
I'm just a small cameo in 'Color Me'.

584
0:20:8,63 --> 0:20:10,65
But I have to break this down.

585
0:20:10,65 --> 0:20:11,41
Let me break it down for you.

586
0:20:11,41 --> 0:20:13,82
First of all, there's nothing to worry about.

587
0:20:13,82 --> 0:20:16,96
We are a major player in this matter.

588
0:20:16,96 --> 0:20:18,76
And our pandas, for instance,

589
0:20:18,76 --> 0:20:19,82
to be honest, the rabbits,

590
0:20:19,82 --> 0:20:20,86
in this regard,

591
0:20:20,86 --> 0:20:23,25
are extremely capable.

592
0:20:23,25 --> 0:20:26,29
We are a country with strategic resolve.

593
0:20:26,29 --> 0:20:29,83
We also have the tactical power to destroy anything.

594
0:20:29,83 --> 0:20:31,73
We have the authority for decisive air combat.

595
0:20:31,73 --> 0:20:33,53
Now, I'm being serious.

596
0:20:33,53 --> 0:20:35,41
Whether it's strategic or tactical weapons,

597
0:20:35,41 --> 0:20:36,18
or conventional weapons,

598
0:20:36,18 --> 0:20:37,14
Conventional,

599
0:20:37,14 --> 0:20:38,18
Unconventional walls,

600
0:20:38,18 --> 0:20:39,14
We can win in all scenarios.

601
0:20:39,14 --> 0:20:40,98
And we've always relied on everyone's support.

602
0:20:40,98 --> 0:20:44,76
Our stance is clear: we're ready to take on the world, plain and simple.

603
0:20:44,76 --> 0:20:46,24
This is no exaggeration.

604
0:20:46,24 --> 0:20:47,8
So, in many cases,

605
0:20:47,8 --> 0:20:49,68
the competition and rivalry between major powers

606
0:20:49,68 --> 0:20:51,1
is entirely different from that with smaller countries.

607
0:20:51,1 --> 0:20:52,2
We don't need to take sides.

608
0:20:52,2 --> 0:20:53,34
Because if we do,

609
0:20:53,34 --> 0:20:54,24
the other side wins.

610
0:20:54,24 --> 0:20:55,14
It's that simple.

611
0:20:55,14 --> 0:20:58,7
We can turn the tide with just a breath.

612
0:20:58,7 --> 0:20:59,47
It often goes this way.

613
0:20:59,47 --> 0:21:1,19
So when you have these abilities,

614
0:21:1,19 --> 0:21:3,94
you don’t need to shout slogans with others.

615
0:21:3,94 --> 0:21:6,26
Those who shout slogans do so out of insecurity.

616
0:21:6,26 --> 0:21:7,76
They need others’ support,

617
0:21:7,76 --> 0:21:11,44
only then do they feel their cause can succeed. Those who shout slogans,

618
0:21:11,44 --> 0:21:12,92
cough a couple of times,

619
0:21:12,92 --> 0:21:13,92
thinking others won’t dare to speak up,

620
0:21:13,92 --> 0:21:15,26
that’s what a real leader is like.

621
0:21:15,26 --> 0:21:16,36
This is the real boss

622
0:21:16,36 --> 0:21:18,98
The boss has money and troops

623
0:21:18,98 --> 0:21:20,48
having strategic buffer capabilities

624
0:21:20,48 --> 0:21:21,22
This is the boss

625
0:21:21,22 --> 0:21:21,98
So let me tell everyone

626
0:21:21,98 --> 0:21:23,3
Don’t get caught up in grand narratives

627
0:21:23,3 --> 0:21:25,81
Unless you're really studying international relations

628
0:21:25,81 --> 0:21:27,41
You're truly researching international politics

629
0:21:27,41 --> 0:21:28,69
You're into intelligence analysis

630
0:21:28,69 --> 0:21:30,4
You deal with all sorts of things

631
0:21:30,4 --> 0:21:32,8
You run a consulting firm

632
0:21:32,8 --> 0:21:34,24
Or you run an investigative company in such cases

633
0:21:34,24 --> 0:21:35,72
Or you specialize in it

634
0:21:35,72 --> 0:21:36,53
Well, how to put it

635
0:21:36,53 --> 0:21:39,53
Bestselling authors in literature and history

636
0:21:39,53 --> 0:21:40,93
You can work on these kinds of things

637
0:21:40,93 --> 0:21:43,73
Or bloggers like us occasionally chat about these topics

638
0:21:43,73 --> 0:21:45,41
So let me tell you

639
0:21:45,57 --> 0:21:49,249
I really can't respect Comrade Xiaoze

640
0:21:49,249 --> 0:21:51,889
with some of the choices he makes

641
0:21:51,889 --> 0:21:53,549
I feel sorry for him

642
0:21:53,549 --> 0:21:57,85
but pitying the weak is fatal

643
0:21:57,85 --> 0:21:59,85
because in any situation

644
0:21:59,85 --> 0:22:1,17
if you pity a weak person

645
0:22:1,17 --> 0:22:5,44
you perpetuate their fate as the weak

646
0:22:5,44 --> 0:22:7,54
the weak are destined to be defeated by the strong

647
0:22:7,54 --> 0:22:9,5
to be absorbed

648
0:22:9,5 --> 0:22:11,53
The worst thing for the weak is not being defeated

649
0:22:11,53 --> 0:22:12,49
not being absorbed

650
0:22:12,49 --> 0:22:13,37
not being divided

651
0:22:13,37 --> 0:22:15,97
the worst thing for the weak is being exterminated

652
0:22:16,6 --> 0:22:18,4
You know he can't beat him

653
0:22:18,4 --> 0:22:19,74
yet you arm him

654
0:22:19,74 --> 0:22:21,12
you give him weapons

655
0:22:21,12 --> 0:22:21,86
you boost his confidence

656
0:22:21,86 --> 0:22:22,64
you give him something else

657
0:22:22,64 --> 0:22:24,3
He would fight until his last drop of blood

658
0:22:24,3 --> 0:22:25,98
and then still be defeated

659
0:22:26,19 --> 0:22:27,41
That's the worst outcome

660
0:22:27,41 --> 0:22:29,79
So, the best choice is not to resist from the start

661
0:22:29,79 --> 0:22:31,889
At the beginning, you should be like Belgium

662
0:22:31,889 --> 0:22:33,529
Germany invaded

663
0:22:33,529 --> 0:22:34,689
Stefan's plan is

664
0:22:34,689 --> 0:22:35,569
Should I resist?

665
0:22:35,569 --> 0:22:36,689
After resisting, I would perish with the times

666
0:22:36,689 --> 0:22:39,179
Because often there's no need to resist at all

667
0:22:39,179 --> 0:22:41,419
The strategies of small countries and large countries are different

668
0:22:41,419 --> 0:22:42,299
If a large country doesn't resist

669
0:22:42,299 --> 0:22:43,68
It will perish

670
0:22:43,68 --> 0:22:46,64
A small country that resists can thrive; it's that simple

671
0:22:46,64 --> 0:22:48,88
So this is the philosophy of Social Darwinism.

672
0:22:48,88 --> 0:22:50,659
When you have the ability to resist

673
0:22:50,659 --> 0:22:52,359
You need to decide whether to resist or not

674
0:22:52,359 --> 0:22:53,359
And in that regard

675
0:22:53,359 --> 0:22:55,59
Whether you're planning to fight or flee,

676
0:22:55,59 --> 0:22:57,239
It's crucial to opt for negotiations at the earliest opportunity.

677
0:22:57,239 --> 0:22:58,949
Don't start by fighting from the get-go.

678
0:22:58,949 --> 0:23:0,849
Don't gradually increase your troops.

679
0:23:0,849 --> 0:23:2,669
So you see, he initially went to attack Luhansk,

680
0:23:2,669 --> 0:23:4,469
and then moved on to Donetsk,

681
0:23:4,469 --> 0:23:6,25
sending troops bit by bit.

682
0:23:6,25 --> 0:23:7,99
Russia took control of Crimea,

683
0:23:7,99 --> 0:23:9,49
but even after taking Crimea, they didn't understand.

684
0:23:9,49 --> 0:23:11,53
Actually, these are all part of the upcoming strategy.

685
0:23:11,53 --> 0:23:12,87
To guide others to deploy troops.

686
0:23:12,87 --> 0:23:15,57
In the end, this led to losing a significant portion of their territory.

687
0:23:15,57 --> 0:23:16,39
To be honest,

688
0:23:16,39 --> 0:23:21,11
This is all because Ukraine has a large group of traitorous politicians.

689
0:23:21,11 --> 0:23:22,17
How can I put it?

690
0:23:22,17 --> 0:23:26,47
Sooner or later, it will end up being divided between Russia and the United States.

691
0:23:26,47 --> 0:23:27,84
It's that simple.

692
0:23:27,84 --> 0:23:30,8
He's been played by both sides.

693
0:23:30,8 --> 0:23:31,6
It was eaten

694
0:23:31,6 --> 0:23:32,32
and then digested

695
0:23:32,32 --> 0:23:35,17
but in reality, it's just a one-yuan dish

696
0:23:35,17 --> 0:23:37,61
the real dish is Europe

697
0:23:37,61 --> 0:23:39,5
whether it's Russia

698
0:23:39,5 --> 0:23:39,77
or the United States

699
0:23:39,77 --> 0:23:40,99
both want to take a bite of Europe

700
0:23:40,99 --> 0:23:42,53
looking at it now

701
0:23:42,53 --> 0:23:45,45
in fact, Russia and the U.S. are both aiming to take over Europe

702
0:23:45,45 --> 0:23:46,35
China has also joined in.

703
0:23:46,35 --> 0:23:47,74
This is the safest option.

704
0:23:47,74 --> 0:23:50,8
Besides the three major powers—China, the U.S., and Russia—

705
0:23:50,8 --> 0:23:52,76
the rest of you are just not up to par.

706
0:23:53,1 --> 0:23:54,41
First, you don’t have nuclear weapons.

707
0:23:54,41 --> 0:23:55,89
Second, you don’t have vast territories.

708
0:23:55,89 --> 0:23:57,8
Third, you don’t have a large population.

709
0:23:57,8 --> 0:23:59,84
And Russia falls short in terms of population as well.

710
0:23:59,84 --> 0:24:0,88
So, considering all these factors,

711
0:24:0,88 --> 0:24:3,6
The competition between major powers is really interesting.

712
0:24:3,6 --> 0:24:5,21
It's like playing Civilization VI.

713
0:24:5,21 --> 0:24:6,55
If you play Civilization VI,

714
0:24:6,55 --> 0:24:7,69
no matter what you do,

715
0:24:7,69 --> 0:24:9,1
if you have over 600 cities,

716
0:24:9,1 --> 0:24:10,23
or over 2000 cities,

717
0:24:10,23 --> 0:24:12,25
or a vast continent,

718
0:24:12,25 --> 0:24:14,45
do you think you would lose the war?

719
0:24:14,45 --> 0:24:15,5
Right?

720
0:24:15,5 --> 0:24:17,9
There's no question of winning or losing between major powers

721
0:24:17,9 --> 0:24:18,1
only mutual destruction

722
0:24:18,1 --> 0:24:19,48
So in this sense

723
0:24:19,48 --> 0:24:21,96
small countries simply can't measure up

724
0:24:21,96 --> 0:24:23,22
because, to be fair

725
0:24:23,22 --> 0:24:24,34
from this perspective

726
0:24:24,34 --> 0:24:25,96
You could say it's social Darwinism.

727
0:24:25,96 --> 0:24:27,21
but we have to say

728
0:24:27,21 --> 0:24:29,89
I only acknowledge myself as a Machiavellian

729
0:24:29,89 --> 0:24:31,19
Because Machiavellians

730
0:24:31,19 --> 0:24:34,6
rely primarily on deception and surprise attacks

731
0:24:34,6 --> 0:24:35,76
rely mainly on saying one thing and meaning another

732
0:24:35,76 --> 0:24:37,62
In this adult world

733
0:24:37,62 --> 0:24:40,1
I hope that as a poor child

734
0:24:40,1 --> 0:24:41,91
you first abandon idealism

735
0:24:41,91 --> 0:24:43,79
Idealism does you no good

736
0:24:43,79 --> 0:24:47,58
Your particularly good and kind qualities

737
0:24:47,58 --> 0:24:51,4
reserve the softest part of your heart for the truly vulnerable

738
0:24:51,4 --> 0:24:54,56
Leave the real support for those who are truly disadvantaged in society

739
0:24:54,56 --> 0:24:59,43
Don't waste your sympathy on those who appear weak internationally

740
0:24:59,43 --> 0:25:0,37
Because every ethnicity

741
0:25:0,37 --> 0:25:1,85
Every country has its own interests

742
0:25:1,85 --> 0:25:4,21
Don't waste your time

743
0:25:4,21 --> 0:25:6,99
On things like whether it's the Russian team or the Ukrainian team

744
0:25:6,99 --> 0:25:7,85
It's completely meaningless

745
0:25:7,85 --> 0:25:11,84
I've only talked about this issue in this episode; I haven't discussed it much before

746
0:25:11,84 --> 0:25:13,8
I once mentioned this on Weibo

747
0:25:13,8 --> 0:25:17,26
We also did an episode with the background of Xiao Ze.

748
0:25:17,26 --> 0:25:18,3
It was quite fun and entertaining.

749
0:25:18,3 --> 0:25:20,76
Then I even got a like from Mr. Lai.

750
0:25:20,76 --> 0:25:21,98
But at that time,

751
0:25:21,98 --> 0:25:22,82
back then,

752
0:25:22,82 --> 0:25:25,56
I feel that so many people have died in Ukraine,

753
0:25:25,56 --> 0:25:26,86
civilians in the war,

754
0:25:26,86 --> 0:25:28,6
and soldiers and such,

755
0:25:28,6 --> 0:25:31,59
their lives are truly precious.

756
0:25:31,59 --> 0:25:32,659
So, in war,

757
0:25:32,659 --> 0:25:37,49
both soldiers and civilians suffer the most,

758
0:25:37,49 --> 0:25:40,29
a farmer's son runs to another place,

759
0:25:40,29 --> 0:25:41,549
and kills another farmer's son,

760
0:25:41,549 --> 0:25:43,159
that is the essence of war.

761
0:25:43,159 --> 0:25:45,379
But I also want to say,

762
0:25:45,379 --> 0:25:47,8
there's one aspect that isn't pitiful,

763
0:25:47,8 --> 0:25:49,56
Once you choose such an incompetent statesman

764
0:25:49,56 --> 0:25:51,4
Once your statesman is incompetent

765
0:25:51,4 --> 0:25:53,5
Then the fate of your country has reached its end.

766
0:25:53,5 --> 0:25:55,62
This is something the common people should reflect on.

767
0:25:55,62 --> 0:25:59,37
Do you really want to drag a non-political figure into this?

768
0:25:59,37 --> 0:26:0,53
So in many cases,

769
0:26:0,53 --> 0:26:1,79
When we look at the United States,

770
0:26:1,79 --> 0:26:5,65
Vance chose Trump,

771
0:26:5,65 --> 0:26:7,37
Bask was brought in,

772
0:26:7,37 --> 0:26:8,37
Many people say,

773
0:26:8,37 --> 0:26:9,37
This is to push for reform.

774
0:26:9,37 --> 0:26:10,97
But in my eyes

775
0:26:10,97 --> 0:26:15,28
Human history has never been kind to non-traditional statesmen

776
0:26:15,28 --> 0:26:16,82
How much space to work with?

777
0:26:16,82 --> 0:26:17,76
You are a reformer

778
0:26:17,76 --> 0:26:18,56
You are a disruptor

779
0:26:18,56 --> 0:26:19,92
But when it comes to establishing order

780
0:26:19,92 --> 0:26:22,44
it still relies on those clans

781
0:26:22,44 --> 0:26:24,96
It still has to rely on those traditional statesmen

782
0:26:24,96 --> 0:26:25,86
because for them

783
0:26:25,86 --> 0:26:28,32
have a better understanding of how the benefits are distributed

784
0:26:28,32 --> 0:26:30,0
understand the game of diplomacy better

785
0:26:30,0 --> 0:26:30,96
understand politics better

786
0:26:30,96 --> 0:26:32,26
how this game is played

787
0:26:32,26 --> 0:26:33,4
so when it comes to these things

788
0:26:33,4 --> 0:26:35,84
it's a sophisticated form of human wisdom

789
0:26:35,84 --> 0:26:36,97
don't underestimate it

790
0:26:36,97 --> 0:26:38,51
don't undervalue the power of the humanities

791
0:26:38,51 --> 0:26:39,57
in many cases

792
0:26:39,57 --> 0:26:40,73
The more such moments arise

793
0:26:40,73 --> 0:26:42,9
the more you need to understand

794
0:26:42,9 --> 0:26:43,95
in this direction

795
0:26:43,95 --> 0:26:46,41
as a protector of the nation

796
0:26:46,41 --> 0:26:47,95
as a leader

797
0:26:47,95 --> 0:26:49,65
you must have a wide range of strategies

798
0:26:49,65 --> 0:26:51,23
you need to have a full hand of cards

799
0:26:51,23 --> 0:26:53,3
there should be no taboos in playing your cards

800
0:26:53,3 --> 0:26:54,15
no restrictions whatsoever

801
0:26:54,15 --> 0:26:56,73
Only at this moment can you be ruthless.

802
0:26:56,73 --> 0:26:58,49
You're willing to stand in the shadows.

803
0:26:58,49 --> 0:27:0,53
You're willing to bear the eternal blame.

804
0:27:0,53 --> 0:27:3,74
Only then can the people of this era

805
0:27:3,74 --> 0:27:4,92
enjoy peace and prosperity.

806
0:27:4,92 --> 0:27:6,16
The darker you are,

807
0:27:6,16 --> 0:27:7,86
the more ruthless your methods,

808
0:27:7,86 --> 0:27:9,86
the more cunning your strategies,

809
0:27:9,86 --> 0:27:11,34
the happier the common folk will be.

810
0:27:11,34 --> 0:27:12,52
The safer the common folk will be.

811
0:27:12,52 --> 0:27:15,32
Because these things are directed at your enemies.

812
0:27:15,32 --> 0:27:17,44
These things are aimed at hostile nations.

813
0:27:17,44 --> 0:27:18,73
At adversarial forces.

814
0:27:18,73 --> 0:27:20,15
So who is your enemy?

815
0:27:20,15 --> 0:27:21,15
That depends on the situation.

816
0:27:23,53 --> 0:27:25,87
We need to make as many friends as possible.

817
0:27:25,87 --> 0:27:28,81
We need to make as few enemies as possible.

818
0:27:28,81 --> 0:27:30,69
Only against the most stubborn enemies

819
0:27:30,69 --> 0:27:33,77
should the strongest measures be used to concentrate all efforts to eliminate them.

820
0:27:33,77 --> 0:27:36,45
But most of the time, it's about uniting and making friends.

821
0:27:36,45 --> 0:27:37,88
It's about building alliances.

822
0:27:37,88 --> 0:27:38,92
Diplomacy,

823
0:27:38,92 --> 0:27:40,46
it's all about making friends.

824
0:27:40,46 --> 0:27:41,36
It's that simple.

825
0:27:41,36 --> 0:27:43,54
How to win friends and influence people.

826
0:27:43,54 --> 0:27:44,7
That's a quote from Carnegie.

827
0:27:44,7 --> 0:27:46,6
How to win friends,

828
0:27:46,6 --> 0:27:47,22
how to gain more support,

829
0:27:47,22 --> 0:27:50,29
and influence others.

830
0:27:50,29 --> 0:27:52,49
You should read Carnegie's books.

831
0:27:54,51 --> 0:27:56,85
Don't be afraid to become a cunning and crafty person.

832
0:27:56,85 --> 0:27:59,67
Because your cunning and craftiness are just on the surface,

833
0:27:59,67 --> 0:28:0,83
they are just your methods.

834
0:28:0,83 --> 0:28:2,37
Your appearance won't change,

835
0:28:2,37 --> 0:28:4,38
your mindset won't change.

836
0:28:4,38 --> 0:28:6,26
You might appear fierce and intimidating,

837
0:28:6,26 --> 0:28:8,82
but in reality, you still donate to children with disabilities,

838
0:28:8,82 --> 0:28:12,63
you still show your love for firefighters who sacrifice their lives for this world.

839
0:28:12,63 --> 0:28:14,17
That makes you a truly good person.

840
0:28:14,17 --> 0:28:16,9
It's not about what we say,

841
0:28:16,9 --> 0:28:17,78
we judge by actions, not intentions.

842
0:28:17,78 --> 0:28:18,78
Often, it's not about the strategies you adopt on the surface,

843
0:28:18,78 --> 0:28:20,28
or if you say something a bit too much.

844
0:28:20,28 --> 0:28:21,3
In this world,

845
0:28:21,3 --> 0:28:23,74
your survival is the most important thing.

846
0:28:23,74 --> 0:28:26,22
If you can't even survive,

847
0:28:26,22 --> 0:28:27,46
then nothing else matters.

848
0:28:27,46 --> 0:28:29,74
So to survive, you must use any means necessary.

849
0:28:29,74 --> 0:28:31,3
To survive,

850
0:28:31,3 --> 0:28:32,62
to develop,

851
0:28:32,62 --> 0:28:34,86
sometimes you have to violate some principles

852
0:28:34,86 --> 0:28:35,66
that you've always believed to be right.

853
0:28:35,66 --> 0:28:36,38
Because in this world, things work by taking advantage when possible.

854
0:28:36,38 --> 0:28:38,21
As a child of an ordinary family,

855
0:28:38,21 --> 0:28:41,7
as someone from the lower strata of society,

856
0:28:41,7 --> 0:28:42,59
you often have to abide by the rules of society,

857
0:28:42,59 --> 0:28:43,39
you're expected to bear the cost of everything,

858
0:28:43,39 --> 0:28:45,82
you're expected to follow all the rules,

859
0:28:45,82 --> 0:28:46,96
but who shares the cake with you?

860
0:28:46,96 --> 0:28:48,12
In fact, you are the one who should least adhere to the rules.

861
0:28:48,12 --> 0:28:50,5
The world tells us that weak countries have no diplomacy,

862
0:28:50,5 --> 0:28:51,69
but don't forget who the weak countries are.

863
0:28:51,69 --> 0:28:53,55
In this society,

864
0:28:53,55 --> 0:28:55,41
who are the weak?

865
0:28:55,41 --> 0:28:57,82
Aren't you just like Zelensky yourself?

866
0:28:57,82 --> 0:29:0,88
What choices do you have?

867
0:29:0,88 --> 0:29:5,2
Before you become strong,

868
0:29:5,5 --> 0:29:7,16
what choices do you have?

869
0:29:7,16 --> 0:29:8,58
You can play them around,

870
0:29:10,14 --> 0:29:14,2
you can make them hate you,

871
0:29:16,44 --> 0:29:18,6
they can eliminate you,

872
0:29:18,6 --> 0:29:19,88
or replace you.

873
0:29:19,88 --> 0:29:22,2
So use people to your advantage,

874
0:29:22,2 --> 0:29:24,16
don't act on impulse.

875
0:29:24,16 --> 0:29:25,96
That's it.

876
0:29:25,96 --> 0:29:26,9
So to speak,

877
0:29:26,9 --> 0:29:28,61
children from poor and honest families,

878
0:29:28,61 --> 0:29:30,21
idealism will harm you,

879
0:29:30,21 --> 0:29:34,7
just like it did to Zelensky.

880
0:29:34,7 --> 0:29:35,13
You need to truly become cunning and crafty,

881
0:29:35,13 --> 0:29:36,21
