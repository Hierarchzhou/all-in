1
0:0:0,72 --> 0:0:2,0
If you were given a second chance

2
0:0:2,0 --> 0:0:4,529
would you live your life more openly?

3
0:0:4,529 --> 0:0:6,449
This is in Beijing,

4
0:0:6,449 --> 0:0:10,309
it should be one of the last videos I'm making here.

5
0:0:10,309 --> 0:0:12,59
I'll start packing tomorrow,

6
0:0:12,59 --> 0:0:14,699
and of course, there are some bank matters to take care of,

7
0:0:14,699 --> 0:0:16,779
plus the broadband bill to pay,

8
0:0:16,779 --> 0:0:17,859
a whole bunch of things to do.

9
0:0:17,859 --> 0:0:18,899
Anyway,

10
0:0:18,899 --> 0:0:22,1
Now I've reached a pivotal moment in my life

11
0:0:22,1 --> 0:0:23,56
Let me move on to the next point

12
0:0:23,56 --> 0:0:27,0
I'm not sure if the choice I'm making now is the right one

13
0:0:27,0 --> 0:0:30,22
But in the future, I'll understand many things in life

14
0:0:30,22 --> 0:0:32,4
If I had to do it all over again

15
0:0:32,4 --> 0:0:35,189
I might do a better job

16
0:0:35,189 --> 0:0:37,89
But do I really want to start over?

17
0:0:37,89 --> 0:0:38,269
When I think about it carefully

18
0:0:38,269 --> 0:0:42,459
For instance, before I had my son

19
0:0:42,459 --> 0:0:44,899
Over the years, if just one wrong choice was made

20
0:0:44,899 --> 0:0:46,58
or rather, a different choice

21
0:0:46,58 --> 0:0:47,88
he wouldn't have been born

22
0:0:47,88 --> 0:0:51,46
So I think we should just let the past be

23
0:0:51,46 --> 0:0:54,78
It doesn't matter, because he is such a wonderful presence

24
0:0:54,78 --> 0:0:58,9
That is to say, if you really went back in time on any path

25
0:0:58,9 --> 0:1:1,24
you could actually change yourself

26
0:1:1,24 --> 0:1:3,56
They say a person has six chances to change their fate each day

27
0:1:3,56 --> 0:1:5,24
and you might just miss one

28
0:1:5,24 --> 0:1:7,21
Or the timing of doing something can make all the difference

29
0:1:7,21 --> 0:1:9,1
Its outcome can be entirely different

30
0:1:9,1 --> 0:1:11,41
So we say there aren't too many regrets in life

31
0:1:11,41 --> 0:1:14,239
But what is my regret in life?

32
0:1:14,239 --> 0:1:16,799
There are a few things that really stick with me

33
0:1:16,799 --> 0:1:17,66
What are they?

34
0:1:17,66 --> 0:1:20,66
One is the choice of my major in college

35
0:1:20,66 --> 0:1:24,13
Another is the timing of when I started in the media industry

36
0:1:24,13 --> 0:1:25,59
The choice of my major in college

37
0:1:25,59 --> 0:1:27,47
Let me think about everything

38
0:1:27,47 --> 0:1:29,33
Everything that can be controlled

39
0:1:29,33 --> 0:1:31,11
Makes me feel that the choice of my major in college

40
0:1:31,11 --> 0:1:32,1
Was not a good one

41
0:1:32,1 --> 0:1:36,57
First, I didn’t really understand what broadcasting and hosting entailed

42
0:1:36,57 --> 0:1:38,59
I didn’t have a clear understanding of it

43
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:40,3
I tend to think in a habitual way

44
0:1:40,3 --> 0:1:41,75
Because when I was in high school

45
0:1:41,75 --> 0:1:43,47
I had always been a host in elementary school

46
0:1:43,47 --> 0:1:44,85
So I wanted to study broadcasting.

47
0:1:44,85 --> 0:1:47,509
But broadcasting is for announcers, after all.

48
0:1:47,509 --> 0:1:49,349
Whether it's English or Chinese.

49
0:1:49,349 --> 0:1:50,189
I got accepted into both.

50
0:1:50,189 --> 0:1:51,829
Getting into a media university is the hardest.

51
0:1:51,829 --> 0:1:55,4
But if I were to apply for an acting program,

52
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,12
Not the acting programs at the Central Academy of Drama or the Beijing Film Academy,

53
0:1:57,12 --> 0:1:59,4
Even the acting programs at less prestigious schools,

54
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:1,9
We're talking about acting programs in Chinese universities.

55
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:2,71
There are 12345 levels

56
0:2:2,71 --> 0:2:4,29
Even for the performance major at the fifth level

57
0:2:4,29 --> 0:2:6,2
It’s almost certain that you will pass

58
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:7,48
And once you pass

59
0:2:7,48 --> 0:2:10,18
Generally speaking, the cultural course will suffice

60
0:2:10,18 --> 0:2:12,0
But it’s different for the broadcasting major

61
0:2:12,0 --> 0:2:12,92
Over 560 points

62
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:14,84
That’s not something everyone can achieve

63
0:2:14,84 --> 0:2:16,52
This was my first regret in life

64
0:2:16,52 --> 0:2:18,28
It was because I chose the wrong major in college

65
0:2:18,28 --> 0:2:20,23
and then I went abroad to study

66
0:2:20,23 --> 0:2:22,93
to make up for that mistake from my youth

67
0:2:22,93 --> 0:2:24,9
taking a big detour

68
0:2:24,9 --> 0:2:27,3
but this detour gave me a lot of valuable experiences

69
0:2:27,3 --> 0:2:28,38
costing me a lot of money

70
0:2:28,38 --> 0:2:29,36
and a lot of time

71
0:2:29,36 --> 0:2:31,34
basically my entire twenties were spent on education

72
0:2:31,34 --> 0:2:34,1
so this is one of the major regrets I have

73
0:2:34,1 --> 0:2:36,27
The second thing I regret is also related to studying abroad.

74
0:2:36,27 --> 0:2:40,42
I didn't seize the opportunity with YouTube.

75
0:2:40,42 --> 0:2:42,3
Some people say, isn't YouTube for the international web?

76
0:2:43,62 --> 0:2:44,42
Actually, it's not like that.

77
0:2:44,42 --> 0:2:46,87
Back then, I spent most of my time overseas.

78
0:2:47,19 --> 0:2:48,79
So when I was in France,

79
0:2:48,79 --> 0:2:49,43
and in Canada,

80
0:2:49,43 --> 0:2:51,31
I could have been doing these things.

81
0:2:51,31 --> 0:2:53,95
And if I had started from 2008,

82
0:2:53,95 --> 0:2:55,69
I started doing it from 2009

83
0:2:55,69 --> 0:2:59,5
and continued all the way through to 2010 and 2011

84
0:2:59,5 --> 0:2:59,95
In 2014

85
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:2,29
even from 2014 to 2015, doing it this way

86
0:3:2,29 --> 0:3:6,61
I definitely have at least 100,000 followers on YouTube now

87
0:3:6,61 --> 0:3:7,73
maybe even 300,000

88
0:3:7,73 --> 0:3:10,55
this has formed a very stable source of income for me

89
0:3:10,55 --> 0:3:13,61
it might have influenced all the paths of my life since then

90
0:3:13,61 --> 0:3:16,79
that's why I'm now trying to get things going again

91
0:3:16,79 --> 0:3:17,73
Including our Bilibili

92
0:3:17,73 --> 0:3:18,65
When it comes to Bilibili

93
0:3:18,65 --> 0:3:19,17
For me

94
0:3:19,17 --> 0:3:23,29
This is now my core area of focus

95
0:3:23,29 --> 0:3:25,9
But these things are far from enough

96
0:3:25,9 --> 0:3:26,9
Looking to the future

97
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:28,9
As you all know, I plan to live in seclusion

98
0:3:28,9 --> 0:3:30,34
Continuously traveling to different countries

99
0:3:30,34 --> 0:3:32,2
Continuously traveling to different countries

100
0:3:32,2 --> 0:3:35,79
It's best to have a channel on YouTube.

101
0:3:35,79 --> 0:3:36,919
Followers need to grow gradually.

102
0:3:36,919 --> 0:3:38,639
No one becomes an overnight sensation.

103
0:3:38,639 --> 0:3:41,3
So, it's essential to build up your presence over time.

104
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:44,14
That's why it's crucial to plan ahead.

105
0:3:44,14 --> 0:3:45,7
Today, I've talked about this with everyone.

106
0:3:45,7 --> 0:3:48,66
Actually, my long-time followers are well aware of my situation.

107
0:3:48,66 --> 0:3:50,74
But many of my new followers don't know about it.

108
0:3:50,74 --> 0:3:52,709
Including the choices I made when I was younger.

109
0:3:52,709 --> 0:3:56,369
This means the place you're in right now

110
0:3:56,369 --> 0:3:58,349
No matter what you're doing

111
0:3:58,349 --> 0:4:0,389
I often have this feeling

112
0:4:0,389 --> 0:4:2,26
That no matter what you're doing

113
0:4:2,26 --> 0:4:6,1
There's always a better choice than the one you're making now

114
0:4:6,1 --> 0:4:8,769
It's just that you don't know it

115
0:4:8,769 --> 0:4:10,269
If you could look back

116
0:4:10,269 --> 0:4:11,609
At what you're doing now

117
0:4:11,609 --> 0:4:14,409
It might not be what you should be doing right now

118
0:4:14,409 --> 0:4:17,119
So often we say that people should make more friends

119
0:4:17,119 --> 0:4:17,819
listen to advice more

120
0:4:17,819 --> 0:4:19,879
because listening to advice and making friends, right?

121
0:4:19,879 --> 0:4:21,439
when you gain insights from others

122
0:4:21,439 --> 0:4:22,999
for example, when you watch my videos

123
0:4:22,999 --> 0:4:25,169
you might reflect on yourself

124
0:4:25,169 --> 0:4:27,329
you might choose some new and different people

125
0:4:27,329 --> 0:4:28,609
you need to meet new people

126
0:4:28,609 --> 0:4:29,689
and then you need to read books

127
0:4:29,689 --> 0:4:30,549
Why do we read books?

128
0:4:30,549 --> 0:4:32,53
Reading is not just about acquiring knowledge.

129
0:4:32,53 --> 0:4:34,5
It's about understanding what other paths are available in this world.

130
0:4:34,5 --> 0:4:36,13
That's why I highly recommend everyone to read works by economists.

131
0:4:36,13 --> 0:4:39,87
Especially modern ones from Japan.

132
0:4:39,87 --> 0:4:41,67
And writings by economists from the United States.

133
0:4:41,67 --> 0:4:43,11
Including those from earlier times.

134
0:4:43,11 --> 0:4:44,63
American economists

135
0:4:44,63 --> 0:4:46,49
Including those early statements

136
0:4:46,49 --> 0:4:48,23
Including books by philosophers and the like

137
0:4:48,23 --> 0:4:50,26
He can help steer your life in the right direction

138
0:4:50,26 --> 0:4:51,66
This is crucial

139
0:4:51,66 --> 0:4:54,44
So often, we shouldn't just keep reading these kinds of things

140
0:4:54,44 --> 0:4:56,5
Novels by authors and such

141
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:59,21
I think novels by authors can certainly refine one's sensibilities

142
0:4:59,21 --> 0:5:2,8
But their role in guiding life is not significant

143
0:5:2,24 --> 0:5:4,36
That's why I especially recommend reading some philosophy

144
0:5:4,36 --> 0:5:4,96
And economics

145
0:5:4,96 --> 0:5:6,16
Some reference works in political science

146
0:5:6,16 --> 0:5:7,24
including materials on sociology

147
0:5:7,24 --> 0:5:10,59
because these topics are more closely related to your life

148
0:5:10,59 --> 0:5:12,3
especially books on economics

149
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:14,35
which cover broad overviews of economic concepts

150
0:5:14,35 --> 0:5:16,47
they can be quite instructive for you personally

151
0:5:16,47 --> 0:5:17,73
particularly books on financial management

152
0:5:17,73 --> 0:5:19,83
they don't have to be overly formal

153
0:5:19,83 --> 0:5:21,19
but they can hit the nail on the head

154
0:5:21,19 --> 0:5:22,43
But he can also tell you

155
0:5:22,43 --> 0:5:23,75
about other people's lifestyles

156
0:5:23,75 --> 0:5:25,39
how many different kinds of people there are in this world

157
0:5:25,39 --> 0:5:26,58
You can share these insights

158
0:5:26,58 --> 0:5:29,94
So reading and getting to know people are relatively quick ways

159
0:5:29,94 --> 0:5:33,3
Most other things are just a waste of our lives

160
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:34,84
like eating

161
0:5:34,84 --> 0:5:35,68
like sleeping

162
0:5:35,68 --> 0:5:37,0
like interacting with others

163
0:5:37,0 --> 0:5:40,21
This pursuit of a great harmony in life

164
0:5:40,21 --> 0:5:42,45
All these things are merely the cycle of fulfilling desires

165
0:5:42,45 --> 0:5:43,39
Eating and sleeping

166
0:5:43,39 --> 0:5:45,62
Breathing and drinking water

167
0:5:45,62 --> 0:5:47,3
But what truly elevates you

168
0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:49,3
Or helps you on your life's journey

169
0:5:49,3 --> 0:5:50,6
Is reading

170
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:51,82
Reading and watching videos

171
0:5:51,82 --> 0:5:53,14
And making friends with people

172
0:5:53,14 --> 0:5:55,62
Making friends with people is actually a more convenient method.

173
0:5:55,62 --> 0:5:57,5
Of course, some people might not be good at socializing.

174
0:5:57,5 --> 0:6:0,89
But I think learning from people is faster than learning from books.

175
0:6:0,89 --> 0:6:4,27
And people can spark your interest much earlier and more effectively.

176
0:6:4,27 --> 0:6:7,34
Once you've spent some time deeply connecting with someone,

177
0:6:7,34 --> 0:6:10,98
you can extract a lot of their life experiences.

178
0:6:10,98 --> 0:6:14,8
And the convenience that comes with their choices.

179
0:6:14,8 --> 0:6:15,8
For example, if you and I become close friends,

180
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:19,4
I would share with you some of my life experiences.

181
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:20,12
So this is my video

182
0:6:20,12 --> 0:6:22,11
Sometimes the reason why people like it so much

183
0:6:22,11 --> 0:6:23,83
It's also because of the videos

184
0:6:23,83 --> 0:6:26,31
That's how everyone gets the chance to connect with me on a deeper level

185
0:6:26,31 --> 0:6:27,74
The opportunity for deep interaction

186
0:6:27,74 --> 0:6:29,2
So more often than not

187
0:6:29,2 --> 0:6:31,86
If you can spend some time on mentors and good friends

188
0:6:31,86 --> 0:6:32,95
It can be very beneficial

189
0:6:32,95 --> 0:6:34,9
Another thing is buying books

190
0:6:34,9 --> 0:6:35,63
But what kind of books should you buy?

191
0:6:35,63 --> 0:6:37,9
After all, there are countless books out there.

192
0:6:37,9 --> 0:6:39,169
So, you might need recommendations from others.

193
0:6:39,169 --> 0:6:41,129
Because the recommendations in other people's videos,

194
0:6:41,129 --> 0:6:42,369
due to others' influences,

195
0:6:42,369 --> 0:6:43,169
you end up reading certain books,

196
0:6:43,169 --> 0:6:45,73
which might be ones you'd never normally consider buying.

197
0:6:45,73 --> 0:6:48,93
That's why some people will share what's on their reading list,

198
0:6:48,93 --> 0:6:51,48
and then recommend mine in the comments section.

199
0:6:51,48 --> 0:6:52,72
The reading lists I've been looking at

200
0:6:52,72 --> 0:6:55,16
I think these reading lists are quite introductory

201
0:6:55,16 --> 0:6:56,43
They're fairly basic stuff

202
0:6:56,43 --> 0:6:59,9
But they can guide you into a broader

203
0:6:59,9 --> 0:6:59,95
Spectrum of exploration

204
0:6:59,95 --> 0:7:3,57
So I think most of the time, if you're someone who's motivated

205
0:7:3,57 --> 0:7:5,9
Don't just use your time scrolling through short videos

206
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:7,79
Of course, you should still watch short videos

207
0:7:7,79 --> 0:7:10,13
But also explore the more diverse content on our platform like Bilibili

208
0:7:10,13 --> 0:7:12,55
Don't keep staring at the big swing swaying back and forth.

209
0:7:12,55 --> 0:7:16,1
All kinds of BGM can really stimulate your hormones.

210
0:7:16,1 --> 0:7:18,7
They trigger the release of dopamine and endorphins.

211
0:7:18,7 --> 0:7:21,48
But in reality, this is an activation of primitive desires.

212
0:7:21,48 --> 0:7:24,26
It's about you gaining more territory,

213
0:7:24,26 --> 0:7:25,42
getting more food,

214
0:7:25,42 --> 0:7:26,82
and attracting more mating partners,

215
0:7:26,82 --> 0:7:27,84
to complete mating,

216
0:7:27,84 --> 0:7:30,99
and raising offspring—these are biological instincts.

217
0:7:30,99 --> 0:7:32,3
As a human being

218
0:7:32,3 --> 0:7:33,23
you have spiritual needs

219
0:7:33,23 --> 0:7:34,43
you have cultural needs

220
0:7:34,43 --> 0:7:36,75
these are the things that set you apart from others

221
0:7:36,75 --> 0:7:38,56
the dividing line between humans and animals

222
0:7:38,56 --> 0:7:42,5
so if you want to achieve more freedom in society

223
0:7:42,5 --> 0:7:44,4
a higher position

224
0:7:44,4 --> 0:7:46,539
you need to continuously enrich your knowledge

225
0:7:46,539 --> 0:7:49,259
because compared to someone with shallow knowledge

226
0:7:49,259 --> 0:7:51,379
and lower cognitive abilities

227
0:7:51,379 --> 0:7:53,879
you will recognize the depth of your own knowledge

228
0:7:53,879 --> 0:7:55,27
so many times

229
0:7:55,27 --> 0:7:59,23
I still recommend spending more time buying and reading books

230
0:7:59,23 --> 0:8:1,9
going to the library to read

231
0:8:1,9 --> 0:8:2,37
even e-books

232
0:8:2,37 --> 0:8:3,15
you might have downloaded so many

233
0:8:3,15 --> 0:8:5,17
but downloading them doesn't mean you've read them

234
0:8:5,17 --> 0:8:7,91
try to flip through them when you have free time

235
0:8:7,91 --> 0:8:8,85
reading is always beneficial

236
0:8:8,85 --> 0:8:11,82
and try to

237
0:8:11,82 --> 0:8:14,64
before you accumulate your first pot of gold

238
0:8:14,64 --> 0:8:15,76
spend less money

239
0:8:15,76 --> 0:8:18,1
reduce indulging in food and drink

240
0:8:18,1 --> 0:8:18,9
you're young

241
0:8:18,9 --> 0:8:22,409
don't compare yourself to a 40-year-old

242
0:8:22,409 --> 0:8:26,129
young people are often susceptible to excessive spending

243
0:8:26,129 --> 0:8:28,98
don't work just to consume

244
0:8:28,98 --> 0:8:30,38
normal spending

245
0:8:30,38 --> 0:8:31,86
to maintain a decent lifestyle is fine

246
0:8:31,86 --> 0:8:33,46
but don't work

247
0:8:33,46 --> 0:8:34,68
for your consumption

248
0:8:34,68 --> 0:8:35,78
or desires

249
0:8:35,78 --> 0:8:38,559
that's the worst thing, as it traps you in a vicious economic cycle
