1
0:0:0,36 --> 0:0:3,11
Perception determines attitude.

2
0:0:3,11 --> 0:0:6,37
Perception defines the breadth of our world.

3
0:0:6,37 --> 0:0:10,9
A few days ago, I posted a video that got so much backlash it was taken down.

4
0:0:10,9 --> 0:0:13,9
At the time, I felt something wasn't quite right.

5
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:14,41
Now, thinking back on it,

6
0:0:14,41 --> 0:0:16,79
why did I talk about that girl?

7
0:0:16,79 --> 0:0:20,59
As an old hand at this,

8
0:0:20,59 --> 0:0:23,17
I should have talked about myself.

9
0:0:23,17 --> 0:0:25,19
Because I'm all about speed.

10
0:0:25,19 --> 0:0:26,71
To bring glory to our country

11
0:0:26,71 --> 0:0:29,31
Continuously venturing out

12
0:0:29,31 --> 0:0:31,89
This is a truly excellent example

13
0:0:31,89 --> 0:0:36,84
But my new followers don't know about my glorious past.

14
0:0:36,84 --> 0:0:41,76
Thinking back 15 years, I was a student in France

15
0:0:41,76 --> 0:0:45,47
At that time, I posted a bug in my life

16
0:0:45,47 --> 0:0:47,67
What was this life bug called

17
0:0:47,67 --> 0:0:49,98
It was learning French

18
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:53,14
Learning French can fulfill three things for you

19
0:0:53,14 --> 0:0:55,58
One can help you prepare for the postgraduate entrance exam

20
0:0:55,58 --> 0:0:57,76
Another can assist you in preparing for the civil service exam

21
0:0:57,76 --> 0:1:1,19
And it can even help you find a girlfriend

22
0:1:1,19 --> 0:1:5,29
I've been mentioning this to everyone from the very beginning

23
0:1:5,29 --> 0:1:7,31
From 2007 to 2010

24
0:1:7,31 --> 0:1:8,979
I was in France

25
0:1:8,979 --> 0:1:11,439
During this period in France

26
0:1:11,439 --> 0:1:13,479
French universities have a three-year system

27
0:1:13,479 --> 0:1:15,68
So if you know French

28
0:1:15,68 --> 0:1:17,28
Applying to universities in France

29
0:1:17,28 --> 0:1:19,26
Universities in France are free

30
0:1:19,26 --> 0:1:22,99
While most people in China attend a four-year university

31
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:25,35
This means if you apply for a master’s program

32
0:1:25,35 --> 0:1:27,52
You can directly apply for the second year of the master’s program

33
0:1:27,52 --> 0:1:30,16
So, the real watered-down master’s degree is in France

34
0:1:30,16 --> 0:1:34,6
Many people say they haven’t even mastered English yet

35
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:35,32
Why learn French then

36
0:1:35,32 --> 0:1:37,78
Actually, everyone just needs a high school level of English

37
0:1:37,78 --> 0:1:38,979
I've taken the college entrance exam

38
0:1:38,979 --> 0:1:40,939
French isn't difficult to learn

39
0:1:40,939 --> 0:1:43,19
It's just that the verbs can be tricky

40
0:1:43,19 --> 0:1:45,6
But they are all Latin-based words

41
0:1:45,6 --> 0:1:49,2
Many nouns are the same as in English

42
0:1:49,2 --> 0:1:51,46
When I was in Paris

43
0:1:51,46 --> 0:1:52,92
I had a lot of free time

44
0:1:52,92 --> 0:1:54,36
I hooked up

45
0:1:54,36 --> 0:1:57,88
I hooked up with someone in Montpellier, France

46
0:1:57,88 --> 0:2:1,6
Montpellier is a small city between Marseille and Nice.

47
0:2:1,6 --> 0:2:3,74
It’s located along the route from Lyon heading south.

48
0:2:3,74 --> 0:2:6,8
You’ll find Montpellier as you continue south from Lyon.

49
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:8,0
If you’re traveling from Paris, you should start from Paris Gare de Lyon.

50
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:12,28
I forget whether it’s the North, South, or East station, but it’s likely the South station.

51
0:2:12,28 --> 0:2:14,28
Paris has several high-speed train stations.

52
0:2:14,28 --> 0:2:15,66
The journey on the French high-speed train takes about three and a half hours to reach Montpellier.

53
0:2:21,95 --> 0:2:23,19
I arrived in Montpellier.

54
0:2:23,19 --> 0:2:23,91
This place,

55
0:2:23,91 --> 0:2:28,959
is a magical experience that I'll never forget in my life.

56
0:2:29,79 --> 0:2:32,279
The place has a gender ratio

57
0:2:32,279 --> 0:2:35,59
that is extremely imbalanced.

58
0:2:35,59 --> 0:2:41,2
The university town is a bit like Langfang, near Beijing.

59
0:2:41,2 --> 0:2:42,18
Langfang University Town,

60
0:2:42,18 --> 0:2:45,34
but this university town is filled with female students.

61
0:2:45,34 --> 0:2:48,159
It’s all the Faculty of Arts.

62
0:2:48,159 --> 0:2:51,239
All sorts of majors that only girls apply for

63
0:2:51,239 --> 0:2:54,759
At that time, I had a good friend

64
0:2:54,759 --> 0:2:55,679
Right

65
0:2:55,679 --> 0:2:58,219
I went to Montpellier to visit him

66
0:2:58,219 --> 0:3:0,859
What else can young people do, really

67
0:3:0,859 --> 0:3:1,899
You know, that kind of thing

68
0:3:1,899 --> 0:3:2,99
Isn't that right

69
0:3:2,99 --> 0:3:4,49
But that's not the point

70
0:3:4,49 --> 0:3:7,87
The point is, I stayed in Montpellier for a few more days

71
0:3:7,87 --> 0:3:12,28
It gives me a kind of soul-penetrating horror.

72
0:3:12,28 --> 0:3:16,3
I've never been stared at like this in my life.

73
0:3:16,3 --> 0:3:19,55
People see Brother Rong at 41 as already being creepy.

74
0:3:19,55 --> 0:3:21,3
Greasy and smelly,

75
0:3:21,3 --> 0:3:22,77
with thinning hair,

76
0:3:25,29 --> 0:3:27,849
but when I was in my mid-twenties,

77
0:3:27,849 --> 0:3:30,55
when I was around 24 or 25,

78
0:3:30,99 --> 0:3:33,93
I was still quite good-looking.

79
0:3:33,93 --> 0:3:37,31
That was the peak of my life.

80
0:3:37,31 --> 0:3:40,49
But let's not go out of our way to look for it.

81
0:3:40,49 --> 0:3:42,68
I'm actually pretty average-looking.

82
0:3:42,68 --> 0:3:43,9
At 05:05, right?

83
0:3:43,9 --> 0:3:45,55
Not even close to a six.

84
0:3:45,55 --> 0:3:50,5
But in Montpellier, it's just incredibly magical.

85
0:3:50,5 --> 0:3:51,39
What makes it so magical?

86
0:3:51,39 --> 0:3:52,19
Let me tell you.

87
0:3:52,19 --> 0:3:56,25
I was with my girlfriend on this tram.

88
0:3:56,25 --> 0:3:58,71
Just like when Big S walks in.

89
0:3:58,71 --> 0:4:0,71
What's particularly scary is

90
0:4:0,71 --> 0:4:3,99
at this moment, girls from various ethnic groups in France

91
0:4:3,99 --> 0:4:5,79
from Black to Arab

92
0:4:5,79 --> 0:4:6,59
to North African

93
0:4:6,59 --> 0:4:8,4
to European

94
0:4:8,4 --> 0:4:11,39
all looked at me at once

95
0:4:11,39 --> 0:4:15,27
without any sense of embarrassment

96
0:4:15,27 --> 0:4:18,0
as if they were about to scrutinize you

97
0:4:18,0 --> 0:4:19,52
how do you say this

98
0:4:19,52 --> 0:4:21,52
Is this called Nanning?

99
0:4:21,52 --> 0:4:22,78
This is called Nüning.

100
0:4:22,78 --> 0:4:24,8
Ning is a boy.

101
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:26,23
It's like they're about to strip you down.

102
0:4:26,23 --> 0:4:28,59
And the next moment, they’re going to pin you to the ground.

103
0:4:28,59 --> 0:4:32,229
Then they look at me like wolves eyeing their prey.

104
0:4:32,229 --> 0:4:35,89
But when they see that girl, it’s pure hatred.

105
0:4:35,89 --> 0:4:37,53
Like they want to tear her apart.

106
0:4:37,53 --> 0:4:38,9
You know what I mean?

107
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:39,31
Because in this place

108
0:4:39,31 --> 0:4:41,77
the gender ratio shockingly reaches

109
0:4:41,77 --> 0:4:43,32
one to nineteen

110
0:4:43,32 --> 0:4:45,26
a one-to-nineteen ratio is particularly scary

111
0:4:45,26 --> 0:4:47,5
among us, French international students

112
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:50,74
many people are hesitant to apply or attend schools here

113
0:4:50,74 --> 0:4:53,37
because applying to schools here means you likely won't find a boyfriend

114
0:4:53,37 --> 0:4:55,3
the guys who come here

115
0:4:55,3 --> 0:4:57,45
basically end up being the type who run out of steam or end up alone

116
0:4:57,45 --> 0:4:58,1
Did you know?

117
0:4:58,1 --> 0:5:0,22
But this thing, British students

118
0:5:0,22 --> 0:5:1,28
German students

119
0:5:1,28 --> 0:5:1,98
and American

120
0:5:1,98 --> 0:5:3,65
Canadian students don’t know

121
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:5,93
Later when I studied in Canada

122
0:5:5,93 --> 0:5:7,89
Canadians are mostly indifferent

123
0:5:7,89 --> 0:5:9,73
Basically, you have to ask three times to get one response

124
0:5:9,73 --> 0:5:10,57
So in Canada

125
0:5:10,57 --> 0:5:14,21
It was really hard to address my own physiological needs

126
0:5:14,21 --> 0:5:17,6
But at that time, I did look into options in Japan

127
0:5:17,6 --> 0:5:18,6
And also in South Korea

128
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:21,6
But we can delve into that story later

129
0:5:21,6 --> 0:5:22,66
During this period, I actually interacted with the Japanese

130
0:5:22,66 --> 0:5:25,22
The main issue with the Koreans was the language barrier

131
0:5:25,22 --> 0:5:26,7
Once everyone started speaking English

132
0:5:26,7 --> 0:5:28,26
Or everyone started speaking Chinese

133
0:5:28,26 --> 0:5:31,1
The racial barriers were basically gone

134
0:5:31,1 --> 0:5:31,89
We're all East Asians

135
0:5:31,89 --> 0:5:33,11
it's actually quite easy to communicate

136
0:5:33,11 --> 0:5:33,77
if all else fails

137
0:5:33,77 --> 0:5:34,7
we can use body language

138
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:35,94
but let's be honest

139
0:5:35,94 --> 0:5:36,9
in France

140
0:5:36,9 --> 0:5:38,38
I always recommend everyone

141
0:5:38,38 --> 0:5:39,42
if you're looking for a white person

142
0:5:39,42 --> 0:5:40,38
go for a Hungarian

143
0:5:40,38 --> 0:5:42,4
The Finns and the Irish

144
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:44,289
are quite friendly towards China

145
0:5:44,34 --> 0:5:47,58
and they are among the white people who are not considered Anglo-Saxon

146
0:5:47,58 --> 0:5:49,96
they are considered this kind of fierce people

147
0:5:49,96 --> 0:5:51,16
or they are considered the Sami people

148
0:5:51,16 --> 0:5:54,3
or our ethnic analysis is not so clear

149
0:5:54,3 --> 0:5:56,72
they are considered the Celtic people

150
0:5:56,72 --> 0:5:58,81
they are not of Anglo-Saxon descent

151
0:5:58,81 --> 0:5:59,89
Anglo-Saxon

152
0:5:59,89 --> 0:6:3,17
The Germanic people might not have a particularly good impression of you.

153
0:6:3,17 --> 0:6:4,69
The Slavic people might be too accurate.

154
0:6:4,69 --> 0:6:7,4
Many people suggest looking for someone from Estonia.

155
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:8,32
Or look for someone from Latvia.

156
0:6:8,32 --> 0:6:10,68
Or that person from Belarus.

157
0:6:10,68 --> 0:6:12,19
The logic goes like this.

158
0:6:12,19 --> 0:6:14,3
When we talk about it in that context.

159
0:6:14,3 --> 0:6:15,55
Eastern Europeans tend to be larger in build.

160
0:6:15,55 --> 0:6:18,1
But French people are typically smaller in stature.

161
0:6:18,1 --> 0:6:19,54
A person from Northern China

162
0:6:19,54 --> 0:6:22,73
is actually quite a bit taller than the average French person

163
0:6:22,73 --> 0:6:25,49
and French girls are very open

164
0:6:25,49 --> 0:6:26,93
even among friends

165
0:6:26,93 --> 0:6:27,7
you know

166
0:6:27,7 --> 0:6:30,98
if someone asks you to have a cup of coffee

167
0:6:30,98 --> 0:6:32,7
it usually means they want to hook up

168
0:6:32,7 --> 0:6:34,34
many people don't know this

169
0:6:34,34 --> 0:6:35,64
but it's common in Montpellier

170
0:6:35,64 --> 0:6:36,96
Let me tell you about the days I stayed there.

171
0:6:36,96 --> 0:6:39,16
I felt like people were watching me everywhere.

172
0:6:39,16 --> 0:6:43,85
I felt like a piece of raw meat being eyed by others.

173
0:6:43,85 --> 0:6:46,13
It was an extremely terrifying experience.

174
0:6:46,13 --> 0:6:47,709
That's exactly how it was.

175
0:6:47,709 --> 0:6:49,629
So I noticed a lot of things.

176
0:6:49,629 --> 0:6:52,889
Young guys in China,

177
0:6:52,889 --> 0:6:55,5
who fail to get into grad school or pass the entrance exam,

178
0:6:55,5 --> 0:6:56,59
you can learn French, you know.

179
0:6:56,59 --> 0:6:58,69
You have to study at least four subjects for the postgraduate entrance exam.

180
0:6:58,69 --> 0:7:0,55
But for French, you only need to learn one subject.

181
0:7:0,55 --> 0:7:1,7
Right?

182
0:7:1,7 --> 0:7:4,19
And French universities use an application system.

183
0:7:4,19 --> 0:7:5,17
There's no exam.

184
0:7:5,17 --> 0:7:6,659
Just a welcome ceremony.

185
0:7:6,659 --> 0:7:9,819
And once you complete your master’s in France,

186
0:7:9,819 --> 0:7:13,6
you can work in Quebec for a while.

187
0:7:13,6 --> 0:7:13,92
Then you can move on.

188
0:7:13,92 --> 0:7:16,26
Because you know English and French

189
0:7:16,26 --> 0:7:17,9
you can navigate Quebec without any barriers

190
0:7:17,9 --> 0:7:20,88
and you can take the exam to become a civil servant across Canada

191
0:7:20,88 --> 0:7:22,91
with a generous pension

192
0:7:22,91 --> 0:7:25,1
and numerous tax exemptions

193
0:7:25,1 --> 0:7:26,83
working as a civil servant in Canada

194
0:7:26,83 --> 0:7:28,17
how prestigious it would be

195
0:7:28,17 --> 0:7:29,64
how great it is

196
0:7:29,64 --> 0:7:30,44
well, how to put it

197
0:7:34,88 --> 0:7:36,53
This is something many people don't know.

198
0:7:36,53 --> 0:7:38,53
Because they have a small circle within their group.

199
0:7:38,53 --> 0:7:42,3
We, adhering to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, will not intervene.

200
0:7:42,3 --> 0:7:44,34
But overall, learning French has many benefits.

201
0:7:44,34 --> 0:7:45,78
More people go to France for education.

202
0:7:45,78 --> 0:7:47,88
Or to Canada to work as civil servants.

203
0:7:47,88 --> 0:7:52,16
But don't forget the small city called Montpellier.

204
0:7:52,16 --> 0:7:53,2
It's in Nice.

205
0:7:53,2 --> 0:7:54,38
On the left side of Cannes.

206
0:7:54,38 --> 0:7:55,7
To the right of Marseille

207
0:7:55,7 --> 0:7:57,48
To the south of Lyon

208
0:7:57,48 --> 0:7:58,3
Remember this street

209
0:7:58,3 --> 0:7:59,38
It's called Montpellier

210
0:7:59,38 --> 0:8:0,78
Montpellier

211
0:8:0,78 --> 0:8:1,96
Also known as Montpellier

212
0:8:1,96 --> 0:8:4,2
There are many places like this

213
0:8:4,2 --> 0:8:5,6
Only French exchange students know about

214
0:8:5,6 --> 0:8:8,2
It's really a very scary place

215
0:8:8,2 --> 0:8:12,38
It's been 17 years since I left there.

216
0:8:12,38 --> 0:8:14,8
Or maybe 16 years.

217
0:8:14,8 --> 0:8:15,32
Fifteen years, to be precise.

218
0:8:15,32 --> 0:8:17,32
But I still remember it vividly.

219
0:8:17,32 --> 0:8:19,76
Rong doesn't exactly have the looks.

220
0:8:19,76 --> 0:8:21,21
But he's got a face that grows on you.

221
0:8:21,21 --> 0:8:24,41
When I was 13 or 14, I was the same way.

222
0:8:24,41 --> 0:8:25,74
Let's just say 24.

223
0:8:25,74 --> 0:8:27,62
But let's be honest here.

224
0:8:27,62 --> 0:8:30,8
There's really a severe shortage of men there.

225
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:33,14
The place really gives off a sense of being overly aggressive.

226
0:8:33,14 --> 0:8:34,58
People can just strip you down.

227
0:8:34,58 --> 0:8:38,85
I got groped three times while walking those few days.

228
0:8:38,85 --> 0:8:40,73
Can you even imagine that?

229
0:8:40,73 --> 0:8:42,3
It's others who are touching your butt.

230
0:8:42,3 --> 0:8:44,62
French people are really open, you know.

231
0:8:44,62 --> 0:8:46,82
It's just a pure expression of affection.

232
0:8:46,82 --> 0:8:49,34
At that point, you don't feel like it's sexual harassment or anything.

233
0:8:49,34 --> 0:8:50,14
It's really scary

234
0:8:50,14 --> 0:8:51,54
I didn't dare to go out at night

235
0:8:51,54 --> 0:8:53,26
My girlfriend acted like a thief

236
0:8:53,26 --> 0:8:54,62
She just hid me at home

237
0:8:54,62 --> 0:8:55,46
That's how it was

238
0:8:55,46 --> 0:8:58,829
Those days were extremely exhausting

239
0:8:58,829 --> 0:9:0,429
Haha, it was really tough

240
0:9:0,429 --> 0:9:3,61
But later, I often went on vacation

241
0:9:3,61 --> 0:9:5,19
After breaking up with that person

242
0:9:5,19 --> 0:9:8,21
I often chose to go to Montpellier

243
0:9:8,21 --> 0:9:11,15
Many people don't understand why I would go to this southern town

244
0:9:11,15 --> 0:9:13,39
This is the story of a hidden paradise

245
0:9:13,39 --> 0:9:17,26
Not many people know the beauty of it

246
0:9:17,26 --> 0:9:20,66
I also suggest you don't go to areas like Amsterdam

247
0:9:20,66 --> 0:9:22,69
To visit the red-light district

248
0:9:22,69 --> 0:9:24,37
The Dutch are tall and imposing

249
0:9:24,37 --> 0:9:26,33
You'd just be sightseeing in a hurry

250
0:9:26,33 --> 0:9:28,34
And you wouldn't have a great experience

251
0:9:28,34 --> 0:9:30,14
Why not go to Montpellier

252
0:9:30,14 --> 0:9:31,92
Montpellier is truly a paradise on earth

253
0:9:31,92 --> 0:9:34,43
I also recommend applying to Montpellier University

254
0:9:34,43 --> 0:9:35,43
And learning French

255
0:9:35,43 --> 0:9:36,83
Going for a master's degree in France

256
0:9:36,83 --> 0:9:38,71
Or becoming a civil servant in Canada

257
0:9:38,71 --> 0:9:39,99
And thus leading a happy life

258
0:9:39,99 --> 0:9:41,7
Life will never be the same

259
0:9:41,7 --> 0:9:41,76
It's been suppressed
