1
0:0:0,78 --> 0:0:2,58
Sigh, it's episode 494 already.

2
0:0:2,58 --> 0:0:4,2
It's already episode 494.

3
0:0:4,2 --> 0:0:5,55
It's really been a journey.

4
0:0:5,55 --> 0:0:7,25
Today was particularly busy.

5
0:0:7,25 --> 0:0:9,34
I was pretty tired today.

6
0:0:9,34 --> 0:0:13,96
But after fixing two computers in a row,

7
0:0:13,96 --> 0:0:15,51
I felt really happy.

8
0:0:15,51 --> 0:0:17,33
Everything went smoothly.

9
0:0:17,33 --> 0:0:18,95
I had a pretty good day today.

10
0:0:18,95 --> 0:0:20,39
So, my schedule is back to normal

11
0:0:20,39 --> 0:0:22,39
Actually, this is when I feel the most tired and sleepy

12
0:0:22,39 --> 0:0:24,77
When I decided to come out and record a video

13
0:0:24,77 --> 0:0:27,57
I want to talk about changing one's destiny

14
0:0:27,57 --> 0:0:30,55
Many people have been discussing how to change their destiny lately

15
0:0:30,55 --> 0:0:31,85
How should I put it

16
0:0:31,85 --> 0:0:32,69
Taking control of your own destiny

17
0:0:32,69 --> 0:0:36,2
But I think they've made the issue too complicated

18
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:39,95
Actually, destiny is a combination of your personality and habits

19
0:0:39,95 --> 0:0:41,85
So, if you want to change your destiny,

20
0:0:41,85 --> 0:0:46,4
in simple terms, it means going against your usual way of doing things, and that’s how you make a change.

21
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,32
That means when there’s something you don’t want to do,

22
0:0:48,32 --> 0:0:49,68
you should do it anyway.

23
0:0:49,68 --> 0:0:51,98
Sometimes, this can even change your name.

24
0:0:51,98 --> 0:0:53,34
But the most crucial point is,

25
0:0:53,34 --> 0:0:55,26
I believe in reading a thousand books and traveling a thousand miles.

26
0:0:55,26 --> 0:0:58,44
Often, it’s not just about changing your perception,

27
0:0:58,44 --> 0:0:59,94
but about the process of changing your perception.

28
0:0:59,94 --> 0:1:2,3
After he made changes in his behavior

29
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:4,38
it truly brings about a transformation in your life

30
0:1:4,38 --> 0:1:7,66
I think many things are hard to come by, like finding a true love

31
0:1:7,66 --> 0:1:9,18
but it’s quite simple for celebrities

32
0:1:9,18 --> 0:1:13,79
it comes from the other people you encounter in your life’s journey

33
0:1:13,79 --> 0:1:16,25
their reactions to you have changed

34
0:1:16,25 --> 0:1:19,4
meaning all sorts of opportunities that come your way

35
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:21,74
the reason they come into your life

36
0:1:21,74 --> 0:1:23,92
is often due to something like WeChat

37
0:1:23,92 --> 0:1:26,1
You saw a certain post in your social circle.

38
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:28,3
Or your posts resonated with someone else.

39
0:1:28,3 --> 0:1:30,4
Someone who rarely talks to you found resonance.

40
0:1:30,4 --> 0:1:33,46
Or the state brought about by your interaction with someone.

41
0:1:33,46 --> 0:1:36,48
In other words, it's about changing one's fate through people.

42
0:1:36,48 --> 0:1:39,1
Why do I need the little sister to add Weiwei?

43
0:1:39,1 --> 0:1:41,96
This is about mastering the random factors in destiny.

44
0:1:41,96 --> 0:1:44,4
I mean, many things, when you think about it,

45
0:1:44,4 --> 0:1:48,59
If you look at life from the perspective of my age and experience,

46
0:1:48,59 --> 0:1:51,71
Some things make sense when you look at them in reverse.

47
0:1:51,71 --> 0:1:55,4
For example, Teacher Rong is a real ladies' man.

48
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,35
When it comes to being a ladies' man,

49
0:1:57,35 --> 0:1:58,43
the character for 'lust' has a knife above it,

50
0:1:58,43 --> 0:2:0,13
you end up paying a high price for lust.

51
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:0,97
A price in terms of health,

52
0:2:0,97 --> 0:2:2,1
a price in terms of money,

53
0:2:2,1 --> 0:2:4,44
and a price in terms of life's journey.

54
0:2:4,44 --> 0:2:6,22
I've paid all these prices.

55
0:2:6,22 --> 0:2:8,5
But the most crucial point is

56
0:2:8,5 --> 0:2:10,9
if you have this inclination,

57
0:2:10,9 --> 0:2:13,57
you would be willing to interact extensively with the opposite sex in real life,

58
0:2:13,57 --> 0:2:15,57
regardless of whether

59
0:2:15,57 --> 0:2:17,19
you are a woman,

60
0:2:17,19 --> 0:2:18,51
the opposite sex is a man or a woman,

61
0:2:18,51 --> 0:2:19,55
or the opposite sex is a woman,

62
0:2:19,55 --> 0:2:22,17
they can provide you with a lot of support,

63
0:2:22,17 --> 0:2:23,67
not just financially.

64
0:2:23,67 --> 0:2:25,1
And emotional support as well

65
0:2:25,1 --> 0:2:26,34
There's a lot to talk about

66
0:2:26,34 --> 0:2:29,96
Especially, the trigger of opportunities is crucial

67
0:2:29,96 --> 0:2:32,8
I mean, most of my real-life opportunities

68
0:2:32,8 --> 0:2:35,36
I'd say 75% are due to

69
0:2:35,36 --> 0:2:37,1
opportunities brought by friends of the opposite sex

70
0:2:37,1 --> 0:2:38,32
So, in many cases

71
0:2:38,32 --> 0:2:39,64
Being attractive isn't the goal

72
0:2:39,64 --> 0:2:41,19
It's just the cause

73
0:2:41,19 --> 0:2:44,259
But the final outcome may not be as you expect.

74
0:2:44,259 --> 0:2:45,779
It doesn't mean you have to do something with everyone.

75
0:2:45,779 --> 0:2:46,48
That's not the case.

76
0:2:46,48 --> 0:2:50,1
It's just a reason that motivates you to connect with others.

77
0:2:50,1 --> 0:2:51,3
It's just a motive.

78
0:2:51,3 --> 0:2:53,86
But once you have this motive, you'll find that:

79
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:55,92
After getting to know these people,

80
0:2:55,92 --> 0:2:58,6
You do indeed want to meet others for this reason,

81
0:2:58,6 --> 0:3:1,69
But after meeting them, your relationships will evolve.

82
0:3:1,69 --> 0:3:4,33
Not everyone is inclined towards the romantic path.

83
0:3:4,33 --> 0:3:5,23
That direction.

84
0:3:5,23 --> 0:3:7,7
Most people, how should I put it,

85
0:3:7,7 --> 0:3:9,1
take the realistic route.

86
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:10,88
They move towards realism.

87
0:3:10,88 --> 0:3:14,95
In other words, why do people want to be in relationships with each other?

88
0:3:14,95 --> 0:3:16,87
It’s because there’s a mutual benefit to coordinate.

89
0:3:16,87 --> 0:3:18,29
To support each other,

90
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:20,59
and enhance their ability to survive.

91
0:3:20,59 --> 0:3:23,79
People have been this way since ancient times.

92
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:26,599
When you have skills that can help others,

93
0:3:26,599 --> 0:3:27,779
you can't just sit there.

94
0:3:27,779 --> 0:3:28,799
How should I put it?

95
0:3:28,799 --> 0:3:31,66
the one you love the most,

96
0:3:31,66 --> 0:3:33,96
you focus on your own affairs,

97
0:3:33,96 --> 0:3:36,7
because skills are only exchanged through time,

98
0:3:36,7 --> 0:3:38,54
helping each other heal wounds,

99
0:3:38,54 --> 0:3:39,959
supporting each other

100
0:3:39,959 --> 0:3:41,799
Provide what the other party needs

101
0:3:41,799 --> 0:3:43,859
You can truly be of use

102
0:3:43,859 --> 0:3:44,919
For example, I know how to use computers

103
0:3:44,919 --> 0:3:45,879
I speak English

104
0:3:45,879 --> 0:3:47,459
I know swordsmanship

105
0:3:47,459 --> 0:3:48,5
I have many skills

106
0:3:48,5 --> 0:3:50,3
But if you don’t offer your services as a bodyguard

107
0:3:50,3 --> 0:3:51,6
Don’t escort people home

108
0:3:51,6 --> 0:3:53,48
Don’t fix computers for others

109
0:3:53,48 --> 0:3:54,82
Not teaching others English

110
0:3:54,82 --> 0:3:57,43
Not engaging in English conversations with others

111
0:3:57,43 --> 0:3:59,59
Wouldn't these skills be wasted then?

112
0:3:59,59 --> 0:4:0,67
So, in many cases

113
0:4:0,67 --> 0:4:1,51
What's most important is

114
0:4:1,51 --> 0:4:4,0
Not the specific skills you have now

115
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:5,96
Nor is it the knowledge you possess

116
0:4:5,96 --> 0:4:8,94
But rather, the exchange that happens between people

117
0:4:8,94 --> 0:4:10,4
Why is it said that doing business

118
0:4:10,4 --> 0:4:12,56
Doing business involves a lot of exchanges with people.

119
0:4:12,56 --> 0:4:15,52
In these exchanges, you provide goods and services.

120
0:4:15,52 --> 0:4:17,82
So ultimately, your fate changes as a result.

121
0:4:17,82 --> 0:4:21,519
Therefore, the way to change your fate is to meet more people.

122
0:4:21,519 --> 0:4:22,759
Meet more people.

123
0:4:22,759 --> 0:4:24,439
It's not just about adding them on WeChat.

124
0:4:24,439 --> 0:4:26,619
You also need to learn how to interact with more people.

125
0:4:26,619 --> 0:4:29,39
Engage with those who resonate with you.

126
0:4:29,39 --> 0:4:32,11
That's why some people talk about mastering private domains.

127
0:4:32,11 --> 0:4:33,47
Post more on your Moments

128
0:4:33,47 --> 0:4:34,69
Master the art of WeChat groups

129
0:4:34,69 --> 0:4:35,47
Often

130
0:4:35,47 --> 0:4:38,72
Your social activity level is often the ease with which you earn money

131
0:4:38,72 --> 0:4:39,56
Often

132
0:4:39,56 --> 0:4:43,9
When you create a vibrant and active social atmosphere

133
0:4:43,9 --> 0:4:46,78
You gain access to a wealth of genuine information sources

134
0:4:46,78 --> 0:4:48,22
As a person

135
0:4:48,22 --> 0:4:49,8
On your journey through life

136
0:4:49,8 --> 0:4:52,91
It's virtually impossible to gather all the information.

137
0:4:52,91 --> 0:4:54,91
There are only two methods for intelligence gathering.

138
0:4:54,91 --> 0:4:57,89
One is through technical means.

139
0:4:57,89 --> 0:4:59,27
You need to understand these technical methods.

140
0:4:59,27 --> 0:5:2,19
The scope of technical collection is quite broad.

141
0:5:2,19 --> 0:5:3,73
But you need to refine it.

142
0:5:3,73 --> 0:5:5,47
The other method is through personnel.

143
0:5:5,47 --> 0:5:9,289
Targeting key individuals in important areas.

144
0:5:9,289 --> 0:5:12,409
These targets possess specific intelligence information.

145
0:5:12,409 --> 0:5:15,99
You just need to engage with him in various emotional interactions.

146
0:5:15,99 --> 0:5:19,79
That's why spies have to be exceptionally articulate and persuasive.

147
0:5:19,79 --> 0:5:20,95
They need to know how to charm people.

148
0:5:20,95 --> 0:5:22,549
This is crucial.

149
0:5:22,549 --> 0:5:23,749
Because it's about gathering information.

150
0:5:23,749 --> 0:5:26,72
The key to obtaining intelligence lies right here.

151
0:5:26,72 --> 0:5:28,48
If you can't even gather the information,

152
0:5:28,48 --> 0:5:29,84
How can you analyze it afterward?

153
0:5:29,84 --> 0:5:30,88
How can you make use of it?

154
0:5:30,88 --> 0:5:31,86
That's all talk.

155
0:5:31,86 --> 0:5:32,88
That's all future talk.

156
0:5:32,88 --> 0:5:34,86
That's something that can't exist.

157
0:5:34,86 --> 0:5:37,85
So, at the beginning, no matter what,

158
0:5:37,85 --> 0:5:39,53
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

159
0:5:39,53 --> 0:5:41,71
At first, it was just a little girl named Weiwei.

160
0:5:41,71 --> 0:5:44,78
Then, in a particularly shameless and excited manner,

161
0:5:44,78 --> 0:5:47,38
Why use such a few methods to start high?

162
0:5:47,38 --> 0:5:49,65
Because your energy field is strong.

163
0:5:49,65 --> 0:5:51,29
Many people are afraid to say 'oh no'

164
0:5:51,29 --> 0:5:52,73
What if they end up disliking me?

165
0:5:52,73 --> 0:5:55,23
If they dislike you, they won’t add you

166
0:5:55,23 --> 0:5:56,87
They simply won’t add you

167
0:5:56,87 --> 0:5:57,27
Right?

168
0:5:57,27 --> 0:6:1,15
So the first challenge you’ll face is getting added by a young girl named Weiwei

169
0:6:1,15 --> 0:6:3,13
People who don’t have a bad feeling about you

170
0:6:3,13 --> 0:6:4,45
People who don’t have a bad feeling about you

171
0:6:4,45 --> 0:6:5,85
Or even those who have a good impression of you

172
0:6:5,85 --> 0:6:7,87
He will go through this kind of inspection.

173
0:6:7,87 --> 0:6:9,97
Otherwise, who would bother to check what you're up to?

174
0:6:9,97 --> 0:6:11,76
They would just not add you.

175
0:6:11,76 --> 0:6:13,44
After you add him, though,

176
0:6:13,44 --> 0:6:15,969
there are these high-level energy aspects.

177
0:6:15,969 --> 0:6:17,689
You don’t just say, ‘Hi, nice to meet you.’

178
0:6:17,689 --> 0:6:18,529
Let’s keep it up.

179
0:6:18,529 --> 0:6:19,209
For easier communication,

180
0:6:19,209 --> 0:6:20,129
this is called low energy.

181
0:6:20,129 --> 0:6:21,55
What are high-energy things?

182
0:6:21,55 --> 0:6:22,71
Oh, you actually added me!

183
0:6:22,71 --> 0:6:23,55
This time it got through.

184
0:6:23,55 --> 0:6:24,35
I'm so happy about it.

185
0:6:24,35 --> 0:6:25,47
I'm so thrilled!

186
0:6:25,47 --> 0:6:26,39
Really, it is?

187
0:6:26,39 --> 0:6:26,83
How can I put it?

188
0:6:26,83 --> 0:6:28,79
This beauty is stunning.

189
0:6:28,79 --> 0:6:30,51
You're the one who brings this kind of energy out.

190
0:6:30,51 --> 0:6:32,54
While in most cases

191
0:6:32,54 --> 0:6:34,48
you can quickly assess the type of person you're dealing with

192
0:6:34,48 --> 0:6:37,2
if they are particularly responsive

193
0:6:37,2 --> 0:6:39,8
it suggests they have a higher IQ

194
0:6:39,8 --> 0:6:39,96
but they might be emotionally unstable

195
0:6:39,96 --> 0:6:41,72
if their responses are slower

196
0:6:41,72 --> 0:6:43,96
they tend to be more self-protective

197
0:6:43,96 --> 0:6:45,14
these people warm up slowly

198
0:6:45,14 --> 0:6:48,21
of course, there are also those who respond in a more polished manner

199
0:6:48,21 --> 0:6:49,5
quite random

200
0:6:49,5 --> 0:6:50,5
but for this kind of person

201
0:6:50,5 --> 0:6:52,31
the tendency for self-protection might not be particularly strong

202
0:6:52,31 --> 0:6:54,14
but he is also testing you

203
0:6:54,14 --> 0:6:57,56
so in all the processes of testing each other

204
0:6:57,56 --> 0:6:59,5
you also learn how to interact with people

205
0:6:59,5 --> 0:7:2,94
so the beloved one is not predestined

206
0:7:2,94 --> 0:7:5,86
it's not predestined that you suffer from your original family from a young age

207
0:7:5,86 --> 0:7:7,62
don't always criticize you

208
0:7:7,62 --> 0:7:9,38
You're always afraid of changes in your self-image

209
0:7:9,38 --> 0:7:11,21
it naturally turns into a relationship

210
0:7:11,21 --> 0:7:12,97
If you receive positive feedback

211
0:7:12,97 --> 0:7:14,25
constantly refine and adjust

212
0:7:14,25 --> 0:7:16,77
into a positive interaction with others

213
0:7:16,77 --> 0:7:18,1
you become an artist

214
0:7:18,1 --> 0:7:22,1
Actually, being an artist doesn't mean you're entirely skilled at socializing

215
0:7:22,1 --> 0:7:25,13
or that you get immediate and intense satisfaction from socializing

216
0:7:25,13 --> 0:7:28,68
a lot of this is surface-level, relatively safe information

217
0:7:28,68 --> 0:7:32,0
Instead, I don't care if others bring me negative emotions.

218
0:7:32,0 --> 0:7:33,16
I don't really mind the matter itself.

219
0:7:33,16 --> 0:7:35,1
Because I had a happy childhood.

220
0:7:35,1 --> 0:7:36,98
I lead a relatively complete and fulfilling life.

221
0:7:36,98 --> 0:7:37,62
How should I put it?

222
0:7:37,62 --> 0:7:40,56
A positive feedback dynamic from my family of origin.

223
0:7:40,56 --> 0:7:41,58
A supportive environment.

224
0:7:41,58 --> 0:7:43,3
So I'm willing to communicate with others.

225
0:7:43,3 --> 0:7:46,38
And I don't carry those negative feelings from interactions.

226
0:7:46,38 --> 0:7:48,669
Carry it into my next relationship

227
0:7:48,669 --> 0:7:50,509
So in fact, I'm quite honest

228
0:7:50,509 --> 0:7:53,16
My social life is always one-on-one with others

229
0:7:53,16 --> 0:7:55,86
I don't really belong to any particular social circle

230
0:7:55,86 --> 0:7:58,8
For example, we have a group of friends who go fishing together every day

231
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:0,69
I have a group of friends who go to the internet cafe every day

232
0:8:0,69 --> 0:8:1,69
How about the Tianjin area

233
0:8:1,69 --> 0:8:2,629
I maintain a single line with whoever

234
0:8:2,629 --> 0:8:3,74
I am actually always one-on-one

235
0:8:3,74 --> 0:8:6,66
Through repeated one-on-one interactions

236
0:8:6,66 --> 0:8:9,799
I gradually learned how to counter each personality type

237
0:8:9,799 --> 0:8:10,959
each character trait

238
0:8:10,959 --> 0:8:11,759
each zodiac sign

239
0:8:11,759 --> 0:8:12,519
each blood type

240
0:8:12,519 --> 0:8:14,32
how you generally react

241
0:8:14,32 --> 0:8:16,48
which can reflect your family background

242
0:8:16,48 --> 0:8:18,4
what your family members do for a living

243
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:19,24
what your personality is like

244
0:8:19,24 --> 0:8:20,96
What was your reaction?

245
0:8:20,96 --> 0:8:22,64
What do you expect from me?

246
0:8:22,64 --> 0:8:23,92
Do you have a good impression of me?

247
0:8:23,92 --> 0:8:24,92
Do you have any desire for me?

248
0:8:24,92 --> 0:8:26,32
I can know everything.

249
0:8:26,32 --> 0:8:27,9
So through these things,

250
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:29,8
In the long run, it's like playing cards,

251
0:8:29,8 --> 0:8:31,52
After this long-term game-like relationship,

252
0:8:31,52 --> 0:8:34,45
You will understand how to be superior to others.

253
0:8:34,45 --> 0:8:37,77
Or how you get what you want from others

254
0:8:37,77 --> 0:8:39,85
Of course, that's a rather utilitarian way to put it

255
0:8:39,85 --> 0:8:42,17
More importantly, we talk about how to serve others

256
0:8:42,17 --> 0:8:44,949
How to experience what a person is going through

257
0:8:44,949 --> 0:8:48,229
Or to sense what they need most

258
0:8:48,229 --> 0:8:52,81
This is what takes the relationship to a deeper psychological level

259
0:8:52,81 --> 0:8:56,63
Unlocking the option for a fully warm and welcoming connection

260
0:8:56,63 --> 0:8:58,8
A bond between souls

261
0:8:58,8 --> 0:9:0,4
Only then can you truly reach someone's heart

262
0:9:0,4 --> 0:9:2,24
If you approach someone with the intention of using them

263
0:9:2,24 --> 0:9:4,2
or just to spend a night together

264
0:9:4,2 --> 0:9:5,61
the other person will sense it

265
0:9:5,61 --> 0:9:8,93
so it's important to be honest

266
0:9:8,93 --> 0:9:10,69
with the intention of not deceiving the other person

267
0:9:10,69 --> 0:9:12,25
but in the end, you end up deceiving them

268
0:9:12,25 --> 0:9:14,26
so war is all about deception

269
0:9:14,26 --> 0:9:16,18
as the old saying goes, war is a matter of deceit

270
0:9:16,18 --> 0:9:18,96
it's precisely because you don't have such intentions that you can achieve your goal

271
0:9:18,96 --> 0:9:20,28
But once you have a goal in mind

272
0:9:20,28 --> 0:9:21,56
the other person will sense your intention

273
0:9:21,56 --> 0:9:23,4
so interactions between people are mutual

274
0:9:23,4 --> 0:9:24,55
don’t treat others as fools

275
0:9:24,55 --> 0:9:26,85
and when it comes to human interactions

276
0:9:26,85 --> 0:9:28,55
it’s not just a battle of intelligence

277
0:9:28,55 --> 0:9:29,91
it’s also a test of emotional intelligence

278
0:9:29,91 --> 0:9:32,1
for many, it’s about the intangible feelings

279
0:9:32,1 --> 0:9:33,599
so that’s where psychology comes into play

280
0:9:33,599 --> 0:9:34,999
Especially individual psychology

281
0:9:34,999 --> 0:9:36,659
you need to have an accurate understanding

282
0:9:36,659 --> 0:9:37,799
especially game theory

283
0:9:37,799 --> 0:9:38,85
you also need to understand

284
0:9:38,85 --> 0:9:41,49
so this is what truly benefits your business

285
0:9:41,49 --> 0:9:43,77
or positively impacts your life

286
0:9:43,77 --> 0:9:45,17
it’s about interpersonal relationships

287
0:9:45,17 --> 0:9:47,57
if you get interpersonal relationships right

288
0:9:47,57 --> 0:9:48,73
the philosophy of gift-giving

289
0:9:48,73 --> 0:9:51,28
This is just one aspect of it.

290
0:9:51,28 --> 0:9:53,24
If you truly manage relationships with men,

291
0:9:53,24 --> 0:9:55,26
both same-sex and opposite-sex relationships well,

292
0:9:55,26 --> 0:9:57,1
understand what others think and know,

293
0:9:57,1 --> 0:10:0,6
and address what they need internally,

294
0:10:0,6 --> 0:10:0,7
and balance them well,

295
0:10:0,7 --> 0:10:3,18
then you will have effectively managed your relationship with clients,

296
0:10:3,18 --> 0:10:4,53
with the market,

297
0:10:4,53 --> 0:10:6,1
and with your superiors and subordinates.

298
0:10:6,1 --> 0:10:7,29
you'll be invincible

299
0:10:7,29 --> 0:10:8,11
so let me explain

300
0:10:8,11 --> 0:10:8,98
let me tell you

301
0:10:8,98 --> 0:10:11,4
instead of studying things in nature

302
0:10:11,4 --> 0:10:13,18
studying humanities is more interesting

303
0:10:13,18 --> 0:10:16,48
because humanities help you understand your fellow humans

304
0:10:16,48 --> 0:10:18,6
your fellow humans are made up of individuals

305
0:10:18,6 --> 0:10:21,2
and what others have in their hands

306
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:23,74
are the resources you desire

307
0:10:23,74 --> 0:10:25,14
Because most of your resources

308
0:10:25,14 --> 0:10:27,94
aren't obtained through exchanges with nature

309
0:10:27,94 --> 0:10:30,52
but are taken from other members of your species

310
0:10:30,52 --> 0:10:31,8
If you want sexual resources

311
0:10:31,8 --> 0:10:33,48
at the very least, someone has to be willing to sleep with you

312
0:10:33,48 --> 0:10:34,32
If you want to make money

313
0:10:34,32 --> 0:10:36,66
you at least have to offer something others want

314
0:10:36,66 --> 0:10:38,61
so they can trade money with you

315
0:10:38,61 --> 0:10:40,49
So this is the most crucial point

316
0:10:40,49 --> 0:10:43,359
It motivates you to serve others.

317
0:10:43,359 --> 0:10:45,119
To serve others effectively,

318
0:10:45,119 --> 0:10:46,799
you need to understand their needs.

319
0:10:46,799 --> 0:10:48,53
and their personality traits.

320
0:10:48,53 --> 0:10:50,29
So, in different social settings,

321
0:10:50,29 --> 0:10:52,13
as you interact with people,

322
0:10:52,13 --> 0:10:53,41
you can learn these skills.

323
0:10:53,41 --> 0:10:55,88
This will truly transform you into a competent salesperson.

324
0:10:55,88 --> 0:10:58,92
and a suitable marketing professional.

325
0:10:58,92 --> 0:11:2,29
That’s what truly enables you to sell what you want to sell.

326
0:11:2,29 --> 0:11:4,65
These things are all about playing the game of relationships.

327
0:11:4,65 --> 0:11:6,33
The problems that can ultimately be resolved.

328
0:11:6,33 --> 0:11:9,57
So many people may not seem highly educated.

329
0:11:9,57 --> 0:11:12,61
But they succeed because they deeply understand the principles of business.

330
0:11:12,61 --> 0:11:14,5
They frequently interact with others.

331
0:11:14,5 --> 0:11:15,97
So it becomes their own business wisdom.

332
0:11:15,97 --> 0:11:17,65
They might not have a high level of education or cultural knowledge.

333
0:11:17,65 --> 0:11:18,81
But they can still make a lot of money.

334
0:11:18,81 --> 0:11:20,829
This is the core reason

335
0:11:20,829 --> 0:11:22,389
But we have high education

336
0:11:22,389 --> 0:11:23,269
Many friends would say

337
0:11:23,269 --> 0:11:24,369
Often overlook this point

338
0:11:24,369 --> 0:11:25,69
Often put in the effort

339
0:11:25,69 --> 0:11:26,409
I am a lover

340
0:11:26,409 --> 0:11:28,89
I am introverted

341
0:11:28,89 --> 0:11:30,89
I don't like talking to people

342
0:11:30,89 --> 0:11:32,19
I have my own world

343
0:11:32,19 --> 0:11:33,11
And that's it

344
0:11:33,11 --> 0:11:33,95
If you want to make money

345
0:11:33,95 --> 0:11:35,11
Then you have to become an entertainer

346
0:11:35,11 --> 0:11:35,91
It's that simple

347
0:11:35,91 --> 0:11:37,91
Because being an entertainer is the simplest way

348
0:11:37,91 --> 0:11:41,23
Sometimes I don't like to label people as introverted or extroverted

349
0:11:41,23 --> 0:11:43,63
If you care about your own feelings

350
0:11:43,63 --> 0:11:45,51
Then you won't want to communicate with others

351
0:11:45,51 --> 0:11:46,83
For a long time, I've said

352
0:11:46,83 --> 0:11:48,94
I could be a very isolated person

353
0:11:48,94 --> 0:11:50,16
Completely cut off from the outside world

354
0:11:50,16 --> 0:11:52,6
But when I need to make money

355
0:11:52,6 --> 0:11:54,74
When I need to interact with the outside world

356
0:11:54,74 --> 0:11:56,68
I have to become active

357
0:11:56,68 --> 0:11:58,66
Otherwise, you won't even have a social life, right?

358
0:11:58,66 --> 0:11:59,88
If you have nothing

359
0:11:59,88 --> 0:12:1,32
None of your needs will be met

360
0:12:1,32 --> 0:12:4,28
So we are all half willing and half reluctant

361
0:12:4,28 --> 0:12:7,47
I don't want to engage with others

362
0:12:7,47 --> 0:12:8,23
When it comes to communication

363
0:12:8,23 --> 0:12:10,35
I become an introverted and isolated state

364
0:12:10,35 --> 0:12:12,39
Of course, when I want to communicate with others

365
0:12:12,39 --> 0:12:14,38
I become an open and active state

366
0:12:14,38 --> 0:12:16,46
So it depends on the level of energy

367
0:12:16,46 --> 0:12:18,38
But don't let your family background

368
0:12:18,38 --> 0:12:19,98
Or other reasons

369
0:12:19,98 --> 0:12:21,74
Lead you to label yourself

370
0:12:21,74 --> 0:12:22,77
You mustn't do that

371
0:12:22,77 --> 0:12:23,85
If you want to make money

372
0:12:23,85 --> 0:12:24,41
If you want to do business

373
0:12:24,41 --> 0:12:25,97
If you want to achieve great things

374
0:12:25,97 --> 0:12:26,81
If you want to manage people

375
0:12:26,81 --> 0:12:27,81
If you want to be above others

376
0:12:27,81 --> 0:12:30,16
You must learn to understand your peers

377
0:12:30,16 --> 0:12:33,26
These are things you can learn from humanities disciplines
