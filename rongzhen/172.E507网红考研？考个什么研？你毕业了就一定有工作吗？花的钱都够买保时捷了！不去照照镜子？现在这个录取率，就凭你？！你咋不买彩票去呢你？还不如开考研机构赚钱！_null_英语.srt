0:0:0,82 --> 0:0:3,0
Hey, it's Bed Sheet Episode 507

2
0:0:3,0 --> 0:0:4,42
Oops, I forgot to turn off the light

3
0:0:4,42 --> 0:0:7,38
Alright, let's just see what it looks like with the light on this time

4
0:0:7,38 --> 0:0:9,46
Actually, it feels pretty much the same whether I turn the light on or off

5
0:0:9,46 --> 0:0:10,46
What are we talking about in this episode?

6
0:0:10,46 --> 0:0:12,1
This episode is about the internet celebrities taking the postgraduate entrance exam

7
0:0:12,1 --> 0:0:14,21
And also about the homestead issue

8
0:0:14,21 --> 0:0:16,2
Because a friend of mine has been urging me

9
0:0:16,2 --> 0:0:18,6
Talk about both the postgraduate exam and the homestead issue

10
0:0:18,6 --> 0:0:21,8
He really wants to see my discussion on this topic.

11
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:24,7
Because it's been quite popular lately.

12
0:0:24,27 --> 0:0:26,59
But I spent a lot of time researching it.

13
0:0:26,59 --> 0:0:27,53
I spent a lot of time researching it.

14
0:0:27,53 --> 0:0:29,93
And I even asked Deep Sick for some advice.

15
0:0:29,93 --> 0:0:31,84
To give me some suggestions and so on.

16
0:0:31,84 --> 0:0:34,58
I found their advice was too positive.

17
0:0:34,58 --> 0:0:36,2
Their advice was too positive.

18
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:39,56
It's not the more negative perspective I was looking for.

19
0:0:39,56 --> 0:0:41,99
Hehe, so as a commentary

20
0:0:41,99 --> 0:0:43,73
Given the nature of my show

21
0:0:43,73 --> 0:0:46,93
I won’t strictly follow the deep sick arrangement

22
0:0:46,93 --> 0:0:48,1
in that direction

23
0:0:48,1 --> 0:0:49,92
I’ll share my own feelings

24
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:51,66
First, let me mention one thing

25
0:0:51,66 --> 0:0:55,62
I watched a video by Professor Zheng Qiang before.

26
0:0:55,62 --> 0:0:59,71
I still really like Professor Zheng Qiang

27
0:0:59,72 --> 0:1:1,78
But regarding his recent comments

28
0:1:1,78 --> 0:1:3,16
I strongly disagree with that.

29
0:1:3,16 --> 0:1:4,72
He has a video where he says this

30
0:1:4,72 --> 0:1:8,9
that young Chinese people are particularly arrogant,

31
0:1:8,9 --> 0:1:9,77
calling Japan 'Little Japan',

32
0:1:9,77 --> 0:1:12,75
and South Korea 'Little Korea',

33
0:1:12,75 --> 0:1:15,57
and Indians 'A-San',

34
0:1:15,57 --> 0:1:16,979
and looking down on Black people.

35
0:1:16,979 --> 0:1:20,119
And every year,

36
0:1:20,119 --> 0:1:22,199
so many Japanese win Nobel Prizes.

37
0:1:22,199 --> 0:1:23,75
Look, how many does China have?

38
0:1:23,75 --> 0:1:26,11
Many places in China are not even as good as Japan.

39
0:1:26,11 --> 0:1:29,92
And the QS ranking, the university ranking isn't high either.

40
0:1:29,92 --> 0:1:31,32
I mean,

41
0:1:31,32 --> 0:1:32,0
Professor Zheng Qiang,

42
0:1:32,0 --> 0:1:33,28
I've always respected him,

43
0:1:33,28 --> 0:1:36,28
but I didn't expect him to make such a damn stupid statement.

44
0:1:36,28 --> 0:1:39,1
First, what's wrong with calling them 'Little Japs'?

45
0:1:39,22 --> 0:1:40,86
Then, what's wrong with calling them 'Little Bastards'?

46
0:1:41,86 --> 0:1:43,81
What's wrong with calling them A San?

47
0:1:43,81 --> 0:1:45,1
They're so dirty

48
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:46,53
Can't let people say that, can we?

49
0:1:46,53 --> 0:1:48,81
Their self-esteem is bigger than their behinds

50
0:1:48,81 --> 0:1:49,87
Can't let them say that, can we?

51
0:1:49,87 --> 0:1:51,75
What's wrong with talking about the good life?

52
0:1:51,75 --> 0:1:52,55
Right?

53
0:1:52,55 --> 0:1:55,34
Is it normal for me to talk about the big life?

54
0:1:55,34 --> 0:1:57,82
It's not about discrimination; it's something that comes with this kind of teasing

55
0:1:59,6 --> 0:1:59,64
Is that right?

56
0:1:59,64 --> 0:2:1,38
So, am I being discriminatory towards Black people in China?

57
0:2:1,38 --> 0:2:2,39
Is that right?

58
0:2:2,39 --> 0:2:5,939
Do you professors hope to bring these people in?

59
0:2:5,939 --> 0:2:7,599
To come to China for university?

60
0:2:7,599 --> 0:2:10,3
Then our students have six to a room,

61
0:2:10,3 --> 0:2:12,18
While foreign students have two to a room,

62
0:2:12,18 --> 0:2:13,68
And they have electricity 24/7,

63
0:2:13,68 --> 0:2:15,48
Do you think what you said is correct?

64
0:2:15,48 --> 0:2:16,94
Let's be honest

65
0:2:16,94 --> 0:2:19,49
What if the Nobel Prize doesn't go to a Chinese person?

66
0:2:19,49 --> 0:2:24,41
First, we should mention that perhaps the most anti-China country in Europe

67
0:2:24,41 --> 0:2:25,85
is Sweden

68
0:2:25,85 --> 0:2:28,85
Remember that travel show they produced?

69
0:2:28,85 --> 0:2:29,85
It was specifically insulting to Chinese people

70
0:2:29,85 --> 0:2:31,68
and they never apologized for it

71
0:2:31,68 --> 0:2:32,6
Look at Sweden

72
0:2:32,6 --> 0:2:34,16
Look at how P-She does it, right?

73
0:2:34,16 --> 0:2:36,49
The recently released map has some issues.

74
0:2:36,49 --> 0:2:40,77
Sweden has long been a country with a particular prejudice against Chinese people.

75
0:2:40,77 --> 0:2:42,39
He has become somewhat pathological.

76
0:2:42,39 --> 0:2:45,64
Why would he be willing to award your scientists?

77
0:2:45,64 --> 0:2:46,7
Occasionally, when there's no other choice,

78
0:2:46,7 --> 0:2:48,0
he gives out an award.

79
0:2:48,0 --> 0:2:49,24
He awards those writers,

80
0:2:49,24 --> 0:2:50,76
those thinkers, and the like.

81
0:2:50,76 --> 0:2:51,72
So-called and so forth.

82
0:2:51,72 --> 0:2:53,12
He's looking at you too

83
0:2:53,12 --> 0:2:54,6
If you're anti-China

84
0:2:54,6 --> 0:2:55,86
So they're giving you this award as well, right

85
0:2:55,86 --> 0:2:58,84
We're not saying that everyone he talks about has issues

86
0:2:58,84 --> 0:3:0,4
But is this an issue

87
0:3:0,4 --> 0:3:2,649
The enemy of my enemy is my friend

88
0:3:2,649 --> 0:3:4,249
And the QS rankings

89
0:3:4,249 --> 0:3:6,569
Are put together by a British consulting firm

90
0:3:6,569 --> 0:3:9,68
A British consulting firm would naturally favor the new British universities

91
0:3:9,68 --> 0:3:10,24
Is that right?

92
0:3:11,86 --> 0:3:12,51
Is that correct?

93
0:3:12,51 --> 0:3:14,39
Japan, as their little ally

94
0:3:14,39 --> 0:3:14,95
their small ally

95
0:3:14,95 --> 0:3:16,55
is it the most, you know, Westernized country in Asia

96
0:3:16,55 --> 0:3:17,99
the most Western country

97
0:3:17,99 --> 0:3:19,15
That’s just how he puts it

98
0:3:19,15 --> 0:3:19,99
talking about leaving Asia and joining Europe

99
0:3:19,99 --> 0:3:21,0
Isn't that so?

100
0:3:21,0 --> 0:3:22,6
Aren't you going to do Yu Ji's theory?

101
0:3:22,6 --> 0:3:25,6
So, your thing, Japan has always been America's lapdog, right?

102
0:3:25,6 --> 0:3:27,8
It's a protectorate, isn't it?

103
0:3:27,8 --> 0:3:28,87
Fifty-five, fifty-one states, right?

104
0:3:28,87 --> 0:3:30,61
So, how do you put it?

105
0:3:30,61 --> 0:3:32,47
Sweden would definitely give America some face, wouldn't it?

106
0:3:32,47 --> 0:3:32,79
Right?

107
0:3:32,79 --> 0:3:34,59
Of course, there are no Japanese who would give Japan face.

108
0:3:34,59 --> 0:3:36,37
Scientists, one every year, one each year.

109
0:3:36,37 --> 0:3:38,96
What kind of level are you, Zheng Qiang?

110
0:3:40,0 --> 0:3:41,94
Your statement is so impressive.

111
0:3:41,94 --> 0:3:43,72
Why are you defending them now?

112
0:3:43,72 --> 0:3:44,84
I just don't understand.

113
0:3:44,84 --> 0:3:46,0
You don't win the Nobel Prize.

114
0:3:46,0 --> 0:3:47,0
You don't win the Nobel Prize, then what?

115
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:48,84
The QS ranking doesn't go up, so what?

116
0:3:48,84 --> 0:3:51,37
Why do you keep talking about winning or not winning the Nobel Prize?

117
0:3:51,37 --> 0:3:55,3
As a criterion to judge whether our scientists are outstanding or not?

118
0:3:55,3 --> 0:3:56,5
Scientists are impressive.

119
0:3:56,5 --> 0:3:58,279
They just need to produce research results.

120
0:3:58,279 --> 0:4:0,379
Why does he have to publish in international journals?

121
0:4:0,379 --> 0:4:2,299
Isn't that just your obsession?

122
0:4:2,299 --> 0:4:2,99
Right?

123
0:4:2,99 --> 0:4:4,77
You think winning a Nobel Prize

124
0:4:4,77 --> 0:4:6,17
Publishing in international journals

125
0:4:6,17 --> 0:4:8,6
And then attracting foreign students

126
0:4:8,6 --> 0:4:10,68
Makes something truly impressive.

127
0:4:10,68 --> 0:4:12,3
This thing demonstrates a high level of scientific research.

128
0:4:12,3 --> 0:4:14,72
Is your criteria for evaluation flawed?

129
0:4:14,72 --> 0:4:17,56
It's the mindset of your generation, the one obsessed with the literature of trauma, that's the issue.

130
0:4:17,56 --> 0:4:18,4
Right?

131
0:4:18,4 --> 0:4:20,19
We young people don't want to carry that burden.

132
0:4:20,19 --> 0:4:20,779
Let's be honest.

133
0:4:20,779 --> 0:4:22,659
Of course, I belong to a younger generation than they do.

134
0:4:22,659 --> 0:4:23,959
More than just one generation.

135
0:4:23,959 --> 0:4:26,99
Now, let's get back to discussing the postgraduate entrance exam.

136
0:4:26,99 --> 0:4:27,419
Zhang Jingchu is preparing for the postgraduate entrance exam.

137
0:4:27,419 --> 0:4:30,119
Then there's that Velociraptor who's also preparing for the exam.

138
0:4:30,119 --> 0:4:32,2
And many others, I can't quite remember.

139
0:4:32,2 --> 0:4:33,4
What was their name again?

140
0:4:33,4 --> 0:4:33,96
That internet celebrity.

141
0:4:33,96 --> 0:4:37,88
She memorized 500 IELTS words in just two hours.

142
0:4:37,88 --> 0:4:43,68
Firstly, I want to say that the internet celebrity preparing for the exam has their own reasons.

143
0:4:43,68 --> 0:4:46,74
I've always been against recommending people to pursue a master’s degree.

144
0:4:46,74 --> 0:4:50,2
So I'm not keen on talking about anything that promotes postgraduate studies.

145
0:4:50,2 --> 0:4:51,3
When it comes to the postgraduate entrance exam,

146
0:4:51,3 --> 0:4:53,76
the success rate is very low each year,

147
0:4:53,76 --> 0:4:56,15
and it's been declining year by year.

148
0:4:56,15 --> 0:4:59,27
Many people take the exam primarily because they want to stay at their alma mater,

149
0:4:59,27 --> 0:5:3,48
or because the exam serves as a way to defer employment.

150
0:5:3,48 --> 0:5:5,44
or because they want to take the exam themselves,

151
0:5:5,44 --> 0:5:6,92
with the hope of becoming a civil servant in the future.

152
0:5:6,92 --> 0:5:7,8
I understand all of these reasons,

153
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:12,26
but you need to be aware that the acceptance rate has been decreasing year after year.

154
0:5:12,26 --> 0:5:13,76
You shouldn’t get caught up in the competition.

155
0:5:13,76 --> 0:5:14,96
The more you do, the more intense it gets.

156
0:5:14,96 --> 0:5:15,44
That’s just how it is.

157
0:5:15,44 --> 0:5:16,76
I don't recommend pursuing a master's degree first.

158
0:5:16,76 --> 0:5:18,11
A second master’s degree.

159
0:5:18,11 --> 0:5:21,31
You’re spending time on things like an MBA.

160
0:5:21,31 --> 0:5:23,39
Firstly, you’re spending money on an MBA.

161
0:5:23,39 --> 0:5:25,36
You could do so much with that money.

162
0:5:25,36 --> 0:5:28,44
Secondly, an MBA won’t help you start a business.

163
0:5:28,44 --> 0:5:30,64
It's just for working in large corporations.

164
0:5:30,64 --> 0:5:34,98
And it's not really that practical.

165
0:5:34,98 --> 0:5:36,26
A lot of things aren't practical.

166
0:5:36,26 --> 0:5:36,74
Jingchu Zhang

167
0:5:36,74 --> 0:5:37,48
He took this test

168
0:5:37,48 --> 0:5:39,44
He already has money and fame.

169
0:5:39,44 --> 0:5:40,76
Like many of these internet celebrities

170
0:5:40,76 --> 0:5:42,5
They took the exam when they already had money and fame.

171
0:5:42,5 --> 0:5:44,87
He's doing well streaming his postgraduate exam preparation process.

172
0:5:44,87 --> 0:5:45,87
But let me tell you

173
0:5:45,87 --> 0:5:46,39
the exams are over

174
0:5:46,39 --> 0:5:48,49
you have to study for three years for a Master's degree

175
0:5:48,49 --> 0:5:49,93
and two years for a professional Master's

176
0:5:49,93 --> 0:5:50,59
this thing

177
0:5:50,59 --> 0:5:53,46
the time commitment isn't something everyone can manage

178
0:5:53,46 --> 0:5:55,1
like someone my age

179
0:5:55,1 --> 0:5:56,32
I'm just right for taking the postgraduate entrance exam

180
0:5:56,32 --> 0:5:57,62
so what happened after I took the exam

181
0:5:57,62 --> 0:5:59,38
After passing the exam, I can teach at a larger institution.

182
0:5:59,38 --> 0:6:1,57
But how long can I teach, really?

183
0:6:1,57 --> 0:6:3,5
I'm taking the exam this year.

184
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:4,37
I graduated at 44.

185
0:6:4,37 --> 0:6:5,95
Then I started teaching at a university.

186
0:6:5,95 --> 0:6:7,45
And I plan to teach for another 10 years.

187
0:6:7,45 --> 0:6:9,28
Then I'll retire.

188
0:6:9,52 --> 0:6:10,64
What's the point of that?

189
0:6:10,64 --> 0:6:11,66
I can start now.

190
0:6:11,66 --> 0:6:14,28
I'm now really passionate about teaching performance.

191
0:6:14,28 --> 0:6:15,88
I could go work at an art school right now.

192
0:6:15,88 --> 0:6:17,35
I could also teach at a community college.

193
0:6:17,35 --> 0:6:20,71
I might just not be able to stay on as a lecturer at an undergraduate institution.

194
0:6:20,71 --> 0:6:23,44
The students in this year's class,

195
0:6:23,44 --> 0:6:25,4
they are working as teaching assistants.

196
0:6:25,4 --> 0:6:25,6
as a TA,

197
0:6:25,6 --> 0:6:26,36
and then end up,

198
0:6:26,36 --> 0:6:28,44
and eventually compete for a professorship.

199
0:6:28,44 --> 0:6:30,72
I really think it's just so boring

200
0:6:30,72 --> 0:6:33,96
If you spend that time fighting for a graduate school spot

201
0:6:33,96 --> 0:6:36,3
You could have made a fortune doing something else by now

202
0:6:36,3 --> 0:6:39,88
I've always encouraged young people to start their own careers early

203
0:6:39,88 --> 0:6:41,38
Whether it's starting a business or doing trade

204
0:6:41,38 --> 0:6:42,54
It doesn't necessarily have to be starting a business

205
0:6:42,54 --> 0:6:44,14
It doesn't have to be working for a startup

206
0:6:44,14 --> 0:6:45,69
But you can be a sole proprietor

207
0:6:45,69 --> 0:6:46,65
You can do trade

208
0:6:46,65 --> 0:6:49,13
So I strongly advise against taking the postgraduate entrance exam.

209
0:6:49,13 --> 0:6:51,1
The cost-benefit ratio is just too low.

210
0:6:51,1 --> 0:6:53,56
Let's talk about the homestead issue next.

211
0:6:53,56 --> 0:6:56,92
Some people say that if you don’t return to the homestead within five years,

212
0:6:56,92 --> 0:6:59,589
it will be reclaimed.

213
0:6:59,589 --> 0:7:0,269
And others mention that

214
0:7:0,269 --> 0:7:1,709
homesteads can’t be bought or sold.

215
0:7:1,709 --> 0:7:3,25
That’s just ridiculous.

216
0:7:3,25 --> 0:7:6,29
I totally understand the desire to live a pastoral life.

217
0:7:6,29 --> 0:7:8,45
But if homesteads were allowed to be bought and sold,

218
0:7:8,45 --> 0:7:11,44
you wouldn't get what you expect, you know,

219
0:7:11,44 --> 0:7:13,1
they definitely wouldn't leave it for you,

220
0:7:13,1 --> 0:7:17,8
it would certainly be taken over by large corporations or trusts,

221
0:7:19,44 --> 0:7:22,44
which would lead to all sorts of major issues,

222
0:7:22,44 --> 0:7:24,18
so it's absolutely crucial not to let this happen,

223
0:7:24,18 --> 0:7:26,0
it must be owned by the state,

224
0:7:26,0 --> 0:7:27,98
there must be no room for individuals to trade them freely,

225
0:7:27,98 --> 0:7:30,94
but as a benefit for wealthy rural residents,

226
0:7:30,94 --> 0:7:33,4
So, should we really be talking about it?

227
0:7:33,4 --> 0:7:34,92
Many people work between cities,

228
0:7:34,92 --> 0:7:36,76
or they have already settled into their jobs in the city.

229
0:7:36,76 --> 0:7:38,73
So, they have given up on this.

230
0:7:38,73 --> 0:7:40,41
Therefore, these things gradually circulate.

231
0:7:40,41 --> 0:7:40,97
Gradually, what happens is,

232
0:7:40,97 --> 0:7:42,33
This is a very normal occurrence.

233
0:7:42,33 --> 0:7:43,65
There’s no need to overanalyze it.

234
0:7:43,65 --> 0:7:46,72
But I think for those of us who do self-media,

235
0:7:46,72 --> 0:7:49,56
If there's a plot of land in the rural hometown,

236
0:7:49,56 --> 0:7:52,14
I would be willing to build a house there myself.

237
0:7:52,14 --> 0:7:53,16
Build a house myself,

238
0:7:53,16 --> 0:7:55,56
and make it feel like a standalone villa.

239
0:7:55,56 --> 0:7:56,32
To be honest,

240
0:7:56,32 --> 0:7:57,2
as long as you have electricity,

241
0:7:57,2 --> 0:7:57,72
internet access,

242
0:7:57,72 --> 0:7:58,2
and water supply,

243
0:7:58,2 --> 0:7:59,76
and all sorts of other amenities.

244
0:7:59,76 --> 0:8:1,3
You could even build a garage yourself

245
0:8:1,3 --> 0:8:5,28
The cost of building a villa is actually around 1 million

246
0:8:5,28 --> 0:8:6,56
or 2 million

247
0:8:6,56 --> 0:8:7,52
If you're in the city

248
0:8:7,52 --> 0:8:8,12
you'd have to buy a

249
0:8:8,12 --> 0:8:9,4
even in Changsha

250
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:10,95
a villa in Chengdu would cost two to three million

251
0:8:10,95 --> 0:8:12,23
and it might still be a townhouse

252
0:8:12,23 --> 0:8:13,51
or even a semi-detached one

253
0:8:13,51 --> 0:8:13,87
Is that right?

254
0:8:13,87 --> 0:8:15,43
Then it's not worth the money, is it?

255
0:8:15,43 --> 0:8:17,68
Villas in Beijing can easily cost over 9 million RMB.

256
0:8:17,68 --> 0:8:19,92
Even in this trending area with over 19 million

257
0:8:19,92 --> 0:8:21,4
Do you think it’s worth the money?

258
0:8:21,4 --> 0:8:22,94
Houses in Houston, USA,

259
0:8:22,94 --> 0:8:26,7
a large standalone villa only costs about 2.7 million RMB.

260
0:8:26,7 --> 0:8:26,75
Is that right?

261
0:8:26,75 --> 0:8:28,59
So there’s no need for you to buy this house.

262
0:8:28,59 --> 0:8:30,87
And when it comes to homesteads, they are the most suitable option.

263
0:8:30,87 --> 0:8:32,39
If you want to live in a large mansion,

264
0:8:32,39 --> 0:8:35,409
I suggest that if any of you have a homestead

265
0:8:35,409 --> 0:8:36,769
don’t give it up under any circumstances.

266
0:8:36,769 --> 0:8:38,52
It’s a significant benefit.

267
0:8:38,52 --> 0:8:39,8
Looking to the future,

268
0:8:39,8 --> 0:8:41,6
in terms of real estate,

269
0:8:41,6 --> 0:8:44,93
the enthusiasm in second, third, fourth, and fifth-tier cities will gradually wane,

270
0:8:44,93 --> 0:8:48,5
but first-tier cities will still maintain a growth trend.

271
0:8:48,5 --> 0:8:50,84
Because this is about the trend of the future

272
0:8:50,84 --> 0:8:53,52
So if you can build a big house at home

273
0:8:53,52 --> 0:8:54,44
It's still a good thing

274
0:8:54,44 --> 0:8:57,52
But not everyone is suited for returning to their hometown to start a business

275
0:8:57,52 --> 0:8:59,8
If you're in the live e-commerce business

276
0:8:59,8 --> 0:9:1,34
Or promoting a certain type of agricultural product

277
0:9:1,34 --> 0:9:3,46
Or processing a certain type of agricultural by-product

278
0:9:3,46 --> 0:9:4,24
You can return to your hometown

279
0:9:4,24 --> 0:9:5,94
You can go back to your hometown to do these things

280
0:9:5,94 --> 0:9:7,26
Encouraging villagers to develop together

281
0:9:7,26 --> 0:9:8,42
This is a good thing

282
0:9:8,42 --> 0:9:10,9
But if you're like me, an individual media creator

283
0:9:10,9 --> 0:9:12,46
There are actually many benefits to returning to your hometown

284
0:9:12,46 --> 0:9:14,98
Many of the media creators you see

285
0:9:14,98 --> 0:9:17,14
We won't get into the Northeast dialect here

286
0:9:17,14 --> 0:9:19,66
They all focus on rural themes

287
0:9:19,66 --> 0:9:21,6
It's actually like this

288
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:22,1
It helps to attract more traffic

289
0:9:22,1 --> 0:9:23,16
This is a good thing.

290
0:9:23,16 --> 0:9:26,0
But this decision must be based on individual circumstances.

291
0:9:26,0 --> 0:9:27,41
Like whether or not to return to the countryside.

292
0:9:27,41 --> 0:9:29,33
Including whether to take the postgraduate entrance exam.

293
0:9:29,33 --> 0:9:31,91
I think taking the postgraduate exam involves too many sacrifices.

294
0:9:31,91 --> 0:9:35,22
Taking the postgraduate exam is incredibly time-consuming.

295
0:9:35,22 --> 0:9:36,9
You spend so much time preparing for it.

296
0:9:36,9 --> 0:9:38,26
And there's no guarantee you'll pass.

297
0:9:38,26 --> 0:9:39,84
Then you have to spend more time studying if you do get in.

298
0:9:39,84 --> 0:9:42,46
So, what did you end up getting?

299
0:9:42,46 --> 0:9:44,98
And Zhang Jingchu took the AFI graduate program exam.

300
0:9:46,76 --> 0:9:47,18
Right?

301
0:9:47,18 --> 0:9:49,32
So I highly recommend everyone visit my alma mater

302
0:9:49,32 --> 0:9:53,75
Kwantlen Polytechnic University, to pursue a two-year master’s degree and then come back.

303
0:9:54,95 --> 0:9:56,14
This is the most critical point.

304
0:9:56,14 --> 0:9:58,58
It's about spending the least amount of money to achieve the most.

305
0:9:58,58 --> 0:10:1,26
I truly believe that a master’s degree is a dream for many people.

306
0:10:1,26 --> 0:10:5,16
It's a dream.

307
0:10:5,16 --> 0:10:6,22
Perfectionism

308
0:10:6,22 --> 0:10:6,82
Everyone has it

309
0:10:6,82 --> 0:10:8,22
I want it too

310
0:10:8,22 --> 0:10:9,46
But let's be honest

311
0:10:9,46 --> 0:10:12,6
A master’s degree isn’t as crucial as people think

312
0:10:12,6 --> 0:10:15,12
And we’re in an era where qualifications aren’t everything

313
0:10:15,12 --> 0:10:19,45
I believe getting a higher education and reading college-level books is really important

314
0:10:19,45 --> 0:10:21,67
Especially for someone like me who’s a knowledge influencer

315
0:10:21,67 --> 0:10:23,29
If you want to be a knowledge influencer

316
0:10:23,29 --> 0:10:24,53
I'm not saying you're young

317
0:10:24,53 --> 0:10:25,81
You're a fresh graduate

318
0:10:25,81 --> 0:10:27,17
You just took the postgraduate entrance exam

319
0:10:27,17 --> 0:10:29,77
I really don't recommend that someone my age, a web celebrity

320
0:10:29,77 --> 0:10:31,21
goes back to retake the exam now

321
0:10:31,21 --> 0:10:33,479
this is called reverse studying

322
0:10:33,479 --> 0:10:35,319
you've already entered the workforce

323
0:10:35,319 --> 0:10:36,899
so don't go back to thinking about it

324
0:10:36,899 --> 0:10:38,239
spending another two years as a student

325
0:10:38,239 --> 0:10:41,83
Otherwise, you might end up not getting either one.

326
0:10:41,83 --> 0:10:43,7
You can go for further studies.

327
0:10:43,7 --> 0:10:45,39
You can read and learn in your spare time.

328
0:10:45,39 --> 0:10:47,15
But you must prioritize your career.

329
0:10:47,15 --> 0:10:50,37
Because the time for school has passed.

330
0:10:50,37 --> 0:10:52,8
You must focus on your career.

331
0:10:52,8 --> 0:10:52,96
Focus on your career.

332
0:10:52,96 --> 0:10:54,48
There are many things you can do in your career.

333
0:10:54,48 --> 0:10:55,96
If you don't know how to proceed, you can

334
0:10:55,96 --> 0:10:59,12
That means you don't have the potential for a successful career.

335
0:10:59,12 --> 0:11:0,96
Academics and career.

336
0:11:0,96 --> 0:11:1,86
And then comes the career.

337
0:11:1,86 --> 0:11:3,44
This is a normal sequence.

338
0:11:3,44 --> 0:11:5,96
So, even though my friend recommended me

339
0:11:5,96 --> 0:11:7,52
Talking about postgraduate studies,

340
0:11:7,52 --> 0:11:8,52
Encouraging everyone to pursue a master's degree,

341
0:11:8,52 --> 0:11:10,7
I still don't encourage people to do so.

342
0:11:10,7 --> 0:11:13,94
Because I think the return on investment is simply too low.

343
0:11:13,94 --> 0:11:16,62
I suggest keeping the rural homestead rights.

344
0:11:16,62 --> 0:11:17,46
Regarding policy matters,

345
0:11:17,46 --> 0:11:18,46
Let's not overcomment

346
0:11:18,46 --> 0:11:19,5
But from a personal perspective,

347
0:11:19,5 --> 0:11:20,6
If I had the chance,

348
0:11:20,6 --> 0:11:23,1
I have a dream of a large country house.

349
0:11:23,1 --> 0:11:26,35
Of course, I also recommend finding a good designer,

350
0:11:26,35 --> 0:11:29,71
There are many houses on Bilibili that are beautifully designed.

351
0:11:29,71 --> 0:11:31,31
You can actually commission such talented individuals to build your house.

352
0:11:31,31 --> 0:11:33,329
If you have to spend money, so be it.

353
0:11:33,329 --> 0:11:34,929
And buying a villa in the city,

354
0:11:34,929 --> 0:11:36,649
To be honest, buying is one thing,

355
0:11:36,649 --> 0:11:38,89
But the renovation costs can be several million.

356
0:11:38,89 --> 0:11:39,55
Not everyone is suited to own a villa.

357
0:11:39,55 --> 0:11:42,39
If you really want a villa,

358
0:11:42,39 --> 0:11:43,99
I suggest renting one instead.

359
0:11:43,99 --> 0:11:44,99
Renting a villa is relatively cheaper.

360
0:11:44,99 --> 0:11:46,92
Even in Beijing or Shanghai,

361
0:11:46,92 --> 0:11:48,28
There are options for 10,000 to 20,000 yuan per month.

362
0:11:48,28 --> 0:11:49,68
You can rent a villa.

363
0:11:49,68 --> 0:11:50,94
If you don't have a large family,

364
0:11:50,94 --> 0:11:52,8
There's no real need for a villa.

365
0:11:52,8 --> 0:11:53,88
Especially for someone like me who lives alone,

366
0:11:53,88 --> 0:11:55,87
I find it uncomfortable even in a three-room house.

367
0:11:55,87 --> 0:11:58,45
So, let's go back to what we discussed at the beginning with Zheng Qiang,

368
0:11:58,45 --> 0:12:1,699
And finally, the topic of rural homestead rights.

369
0:12:1,699 --> 0:12:4,439
Everyone has their own opinion.

370
0:12:4,439 --> 0:12:6,379
AI can certainly provide some insights and inspiration,

371
0:12:6,379 --> 0:12:8,97
But honestly,

372
0:12:8,97 --> 0:12:10,61
If I just followed AI's direction entirely,

373
0:12:10,61 --> 0:12:11,55
What would be the point of watching my show?

374
0:12:11,55 --> 0:12:13,79
This is today's morning chat, episode 507.

375
0:12:13,79 --> 0:12:16,14
Then what's the point of watching my show?
