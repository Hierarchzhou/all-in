1
0:0:0,98 --> 0:0:2,46
A new way to chat while waking up

2
0:0:2,46 --> 0:0:6,96
I've been telling many of my new friends in the self-media field

3
0:0:6,96 --> 0:0:9,46
don't be afraid to make mistakes

4
0:0:9,46 --> 0:0:13,65
like today, I had planned a trip to Shanghai

5
0:0:13,65 --> 0:0:16,64
but a series of issues came up at home

6
0:0:16,64 --> 0:0:18,92
This has made it impossible for my trip to come together.

7
0:0:18,92 --> 0:0:22,33
you'll find that in life, often

8
0:0:22,33 --> 0:0:24,43
mistakes come one after another

9
0:0:24,43 --> 0:0:27,73
and your correctness is far less than before

10
0:0:27,73 --> 0:0:31,86
What exactly does our education system teach us?

11
0:0:31,86 --> 0:0:33,46
It instills a tendency to make mistakes.

12
0:0:33,46 --> 0:0:35,24
Oh, how did you manage to score 94?

13
0:0:35,24 --> 0:0:36,489
Why didn’t you score 98?

14
0:0:36,489 --> 0:0:37,409
You scored 28 on the test.

15
0:0:37,409 --> 0:0:38,729
Why didn’t you score a perfect 100?

16
0:0:38,729 --> 0:0:39,149
Oh!

17
0:0:39,149 --> 0:0:41,109
This question was way too easy, wasn’t it?

18
0:0:41,109 --> 0:0:43,45
That’s how Chinese parents are.

19
0:0:43,45 --> 0:0:46,55
He will repeatedly doubt your abilities.

20
0:0:46,55 --> 0:0:48,69
But he won't complain about the environment.

21
0:0:48,69 --> 0:0:51,95
We Chinese are a highly adaptable people.

22
0:0:51,95 --> 0:0:54,53
We can transform any adversity.

23
0:0:54,53 --> 0:0:55,85
This is truly remarkable.

24
0:0:55,85 --> 0:0:57,37
However, similarly,

25
0:0:57,37 --> 0:0:58,73
our simplicity and frugality,

26
0:0:58,73 --> 0:1:0,31
our hard work and perseverance,

27
0:1:0,31 --> 0:1:5,13
have left deep marks on our spiritual world and our psychological scars.

28
0:1:5,13 --> 0:1:8,72
We tend to be very afraid of making mistakes.

29
0:1:8,72 --> 0:1:11,18
Especially people during their school years.

30
0:1:11,18 --> 0:1:14,61
They have a deep aversion to errors.

31
0:1:14,61 --> 0:1:17,29
However, we often realize that.

32
0:1:17,29 --> 0:1:19,67
When you're engaging in mass communication,

33
0:1:19,67 --> 0:1:21,57
the rule is actually the opposite.

34
0:1:21,57 --> 0:1:26,93
Because your audience is usually made up of very ordinary people,

35
0:1:26,93 --> 0:1:28,61
they are the common masses.

36
0:1:28,61 --> 0:1:31,27
And you are a part of the common masses too.

37
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:34,7
Who doesn't make mistakes?

38
0:1:34,7 --> 0:1:35,67
Sages don't make mistakes.

39
0:1:35,67 --> 0:1:36,83
Are you a sage?

40
0:1:36,83 --> 0:1:37,85
You're not.

41
0:1:37,85 --> 0:1:41,45
But I've interacted with most of these people who want to do self-media.

42
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:44,6
What they often give me as feedback is:

43
0:1:44,6 --> 0:1:44,94
I tell them,

44
0:1:44,94 --> 0:1:46,56
You need to learn how to act.

45
0:1:46,56 --> 0:1:49,9
The most important thing is actually to lower your own stance.

46
0:1:49,9 --> 0:1:52,98
And it's about freeing your nature

47
0:1:52,98 --> 0:1:54,7
Letting yourself become more human

48
0:1:54,7 --> 0:1:56,54
Like a child, like an infant

49
0:1:56,54 --> 0:1:59,51
That state is something natural and spontaneous

50
0:1:59,51 --> 0:2:1,27
Because of the education you've received

51
0:2:1,27 --> 0:2:3,19
The education system you've gone through

52
0:2:3,19 --> 0:2:4,88
Decades of this kind of torment

53
0:2:4,88 --> 0:2:7,62
You gradually develop a strong tendency to be overly cautious

54
0:2:7,62 --> 0:2:10,48
Many people in their jobs are particularly afraid of taking the blame

55
0:2:10,48 --> 0:2:13,4
I’m really afraid of being blamed for mistakes.

56
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:15,32
And there are those who just love to blame others.

57
0:2:15,32 --> 0:2:18,6
This leads to the mindset of the good student.

58
0:2:18,6 --> 0:2:20,92
So, the first thing you should encounter is the mindset of the good student.

59
0:2:20,92 --> 0:2:23,96
You see many people watching his videos

60
0:2:23,96 --> 0:2:25,4
I didn’t want to watch it from the start.

61
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:26,12
Hello everyone.

62
0:2:26,12 --> 0:2:29,7
Today, I'm here to share some experience about something.

63
0:2:29,7 --> 0:2:30,73
Or it’s about myself, right?

64
0:2:30,73 --> 0:2:32,95
Have a bit of experience with certain things

65
0:2:32,95 --> 0:2:34,53
Possess a bit of professional skills

66
0:2:34,53 --> 0:2:35,91
Then he wanted to share these things

67
0:2:35,91 --> 0:2:37,31
But nobody wants to see the professional stuff

68
0:2:37,31 --> 0:2:38,5
Right?

69
0:2:38,5 --> 0:2:39,13
I have the professional knowledge

70
0:2:39,13 --> 0:2:39,53
What should I do?

71
0:2:39,53 --> 0:2:40,73
I don’t directly ask deep sick

72
0:2:40,73 --> 0:2:42,19
Why don’t I just go there myself?

73
0:2:42,19 --> 0:2:45,859
Find some tutorial videos to check out what you've shared.

74
0:2:45,859 --> 0:2:47,59
First, it's not interesting.

75
0:2:47,59 --> 0:2:50,79
Many people want to showcase their exquisite lifestyle.

76
0:2:50,79 --> 0:2:52,419
Girls pick a BGM, you know.

77
0:2:52,419 --> 0:2:53,76
Then, they check in.

78
0:2:53,76 --> 0:2:56,56
Then they take a camera abroad and snap some photos.

79
0:2:56,56 --> 0:2:58,3
Then they have a bit of coffee.

80
0:2:58,3 --> 0:3:0,56
Then they listen to some Lisa Ono or something.

81
0:3:0,56 --> 0:3:2,44
Then they wear a beautiful dress.

82
0:3:2,44 --> 0:3:4,24
Let's turn it around one more time

83
0:3:4,24 --> 0:3:6,44
Then, does it get any traffic with a single tap?

84
0:3:6,44 --> 0:3:9,66
It might attract a bit of traffic from some male fans who are desperate for attention

85
0:3:9,66 --> 0:3:10,74
However, in reality

86
0:3:10,74 --> 0:3:12,66
it can't achieve large-scale dissemination

87
0:3:12,66 --> 0:3:14,439
Otherwise, hello everyone

88
0:3:14,439 --> 0:3:15,499
I'm so-and-so

89
0:3:15,499 --> 0:3:18,18
Then, I hope you'll have a prosperous future, so please give us a follow.

90
0:3:18,18 --> 0:3:19,8
Then don't forget to give me a Triple Combo.

91
0:3:19,8 --> 0:3:21,52
This is what my life is like

92
0:3:21,52 --> 0:3:25,4
You find that all of your life is meaningless, right?

93
0:3:25,4 --> 0:3:27,2
Because you don't make mistakes.

94
0:3:27,2 --> 0:3:29,16
Because you're such a good kid.

95
0:3:29,16 --> 0:3:31,38
Because your life is too perfect.

96
0:3:31,38 --> 0:3:33,59
Your life is just too perfect.

97
0:3:33,59 --> 0:3:35,77
Your career is also too perfect.

98
0:3:35,77 --> 0:3:37,87
All of these aspects of your life are just too perfect.

99
0:3:37,87 --> 0:3:39,18
And you have experience.

100
0:3:39,18 --> 0:3:40,82
You have the experience of life

101
0:3:40,82 --> 0:3:42,32
You have the experience in your career

102
0:3:42,32 --> 0:3:43,98
Your life is so perfect

103
0:3:43,98 --> 0:3:45,6
Is that really the case?

104
0:3:45,6 --> 0:3:45,46
My buddy

105
0:3:45,46 --> 0:3:45,86
Let me tell you

106
0:3:45,86 --> 0:3:47,14
Are you for real?

107
0:3:47,14 --> 0:3:49,3
If your life wasn't falling apart

108
0:3:49,3 --> 0:3:50,82
Your mental state would be close to breaking down

109
0:3:50,82 --> 0:3:52,6
Can you do social media?

110
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:52,92
I'm asking you.

111
0:3:52,92 --> 0:3:54,12
People who do social media,

112
0:3:54,12 --> 0:3:57,7
how many of us are really in top form mentally?

113
0:3:57,7 --> 0:3:59,3
We don't have a normal sleep schedule,

114
0:3:59,3 --> 0:4:1,209
we stay calm all the time,

115
0:4:1,209 --> 0:4:2,329
we never get anxious,

116
0:4:2,329 --> 0:4:2,989
or depressed,

117
0:4:2,989 --> 0:4:4,9
how is that even possible?

118
0:4:4,9 --> 0:4:5,609
That means you didn’t do it properly.

119
0:4:5,609 --> 0:4:6,55
Right?

120
0:4:6,55 --> 0:4:9,83
Let’s talk about what you should present to the audience first.

121
0:4:9,83 --> 0:4:13,5
For example, you might want to show extremely high energy.

122
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:14,66
Or very unstable emotions.

123
0:4:14,66 --> 0:4:15,94
That’s one way to do it.

124
0:4:15,94 --> 0:4:16,9
Take John Woo, for instance.

125
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:18,5
He does it this way.

126
0:4:18,5 --> 0:4:22,7
So every shot of his is incredibly impactful.

127
0:4:22,7 --> 0:4:23,7
Look, look at Marin's way of thinking

128
0:4:23,7 --> 0:4:25,51
All the concepts of Marxist thinking

129
0:4:25,51 --> 0:4:26,73
These outrageous claims

130
0:4:26,73 --> 0:4:30,39
But they challenge your self-respect

131
0:4:30,39 --> 0:4:33,579
They challenge your physical boundaries

132
0:4:33,579 --> 0:4:34,459
Your sense of shame

133
0:4:34,459 --> 0:4:35,419
So when we talk about it

134
0:4:35,419 --> 0:4:38,37
You need to carefully examine all these things

135
0:4:38,37 --> 0:4:41,91
Why the social media gurus have become what they are now

136
0:4:41,91 --> 0:4:43,97
Why did the number of followers exceed one million?

137
0:4:43,97 --> 0:4:46,85
The key is his ability to stir emotions

138
0:4:46,85 --> 0:4:49,15
The crucial point is his content

139
0:4:49,15 --> 0:4:52,74
It’s not about being absolutely perfect

140
0:4:52,74 --> 0:4:54,22
No one is perfect

141
0:4:54,22 --> 0:4:57,38
You see, I should have been sharing my life with you all along.

142
0:4:57,38 --> 0:5:0,8
My life, for the most part, is not perfect.

143
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:2,38
Most of it is filled with the mundane and messy

144
0:5:2,38 --> 0:5:3,66
Filled with awkward moments

145
0:5:3,66 --> 0:5:4,9
It's filled with awkwardness

146
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:6,62
It's riddled with failures

147
0:5:6,62 --> 0:5:9,96
It's brimming with discomfort and embarrassment

148
0:5:9,96 --> 0:5:14,0
This is what a real person's life looks like

149
0:5:14,0 --> 0:5:16,11
There are characters within the audience

150
0:5:16,11 --> 0:5:18,13
What do you show to the audience?

151
0:5:18,13 --> 0:5:19,69
You show the five stresses and four beauties

152
0:5:19,69 --> 0:5:21,51
You display the scenic beauty of our country's lakes and mountains

153
0:5:21,51 --> 0:5:22,47
That's called scenery

154
0:5:22,47 --> 0:5:23,27
The documentary

155
0:5:23,27 --> 0:5:23,86
Buddy

156
0:5:23,86 --> 0:5:25,48
What you show is humanity

157
0:5:25,48 --> 0:5:26,5
What is humanity?

158
0:5:26,5 --> 0:5:28,11
Humanity means making mistakes

159
0:5:28,11 --> 0:5:30,35
Humanity means pushing the boundaries

160
0:5:30,35 --> 0:5:31,15
Saying things that go too far

161
0:5:31,15 --> 0:5:34,93
Humanity means doing things that everyone has done wrong

162
0:5:34,93 --> 0:5:36,99
You've never made a mistake

163
0:5:36,99 --> 0:5:38,31
Are you even human?

164
0:5:38,31 --> 0:5:39,41
You're not human.

165
0:5:39,41 --> 0:5:41,67
So many shows are bland and uninteresting.

166
0:5:41,67 --> 0:5:42,65
There's nothing worth watching.

167
0:5:42,65 --> 0:5:44,89
There's no emotional variation.

168
0:5:44,89 --> 0:5:46,61
What you make is too perfect.

169
0:5:46,61 --> 0:5:48,25
His persona is too perfect.

170
0:5:48,25 --> 0:5:50,37
If you cook, it’s like you’re exceptionally good at it.

171
0:5:50,37 --> 0:5:50,65
Oh!

172
0:5:50,65 --> 0:5:52,919
You really know how to enjoy life.

173
0:5:52,919 --> 0:5:53,199
Oh!

174
0:5:53,199 --> 0:5:54,679
You manage your life so well.

175
0:5:54,679 --> 0:5:56,339
You’re never all over the place.

176
0:5:56,339 --> 0:5:58,499
You handle things with great stability.

177
0:5:58,499 --> 0:6:0,49
What’s the point of that?

178
0:6:0,49 --> 0:6:3,929
That’s why some people create such outlandish content.

179
0:6:3,929 --> 0:6:5,27
It’s so abstract.

180
0:6:5,27 --> 0:6:7,7
But it’s incredibly popular.

181
0:6:7,7 --> 0:6:9,9
Because his work is close to reality

182
0:6:9,9 --> 0:6:11,52
close to the characters in the show

183
0:6:11,52 --> 0:6:13,72
and close to the audience's limits

184
0:6:13,72 --> 0:6:14,539
You know?

185
0:6:14,539 --> 0:6:17,99
This applies to all the people in crosstalk

186
0:6:17,99 --> 0:6:19,739
whether they are the people you satirize in your crosstalk

187
0:6:19,739 --> 0:6:21,21
or the characters you portray

188
0:6:21,21 --> 0:6:25,34
It's a complete reflection of real life

189
0:6:25,34 --> 0:6:27,5
This is what your social media content should be about

190
0:6:27,5 --> 0:6:29,6
This is what your show should be doing.

191
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:31,56
You see, all the stories I tell

192
0:6:31,56 --> 0:6:33,3
are also derived from life.

193
0:6:33,3 --> 0:6:34,78
Things that come from life

194
0:6:34,78 --> 0:6:36,22
are more interesting.

195
0:6:36,22 --> 0:6:38,3
They are more relatable to others.

196
0:6:38,3 --> 0:6:40,6
So, you should dare to make mistakes.

197
0:6:40,6 --> 0:6:44,8
And you're also brave enough to make mistakes in the live stream.

198
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:47,48
You're not there to soothe everyone's emotions.

199
0:6:47,48 --> 0:6:48,6
What others see in you

200
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:49,79
What they see in you

201
0:6:49,79 --> 0:6:51,35
So when it comes to style

202
0:6:51,35 --> 0:6:54,35
You're particularly good at stirring up conflict

203
0:6:54,35 --> 0:6:55,14
How to put it

204
0:6:55,14 --> 0:6:56,18
Exploiting this conflict

205
0:6:56,18 --> 0:6:57,14
Taking advantage of this opposition

206
0:6:57,14 --> 0:6:58,7
Then how do we use it

207
0:6:58,7 --> 0:6:59,74
Calling the audience 3D

208
0:6:59,74 --> 0:7:1,8
Is he really looking down on the audience?

209
0:7:1,8 --> 0:7:2,52
No, he isn't.

210
0:7:2,52 --> 0:7:4,24
He's very skilled at stirring up these emotions.

211
0:7:4,24 --> 0:7:6,63
So, the best thing you can do in the live stream is to focus on your style.

212
0:7:6,63 --> 0:7:8,71
When it comes to all these things,

213
0:7:8,71 --> 0:7:10,55
Everyone's video follows a certain pattern

214
0:7:10,55 --> 0:7:12,32
As you create more content over time,

215
0:7:12,32 --> 0:7:14,48
you might gradually become afraid to leave your comfort zone.

216
0:7:14,48 --> 0:7:15,72
Everyone has this issue.

217
0:7:15,72 --> 0:7:16,84
But that's just who I am

218
0:7:16,84 --> 0:7:18,669
Because I'm afraid of making mistakes

219
0:7:19,29 --> 0:7:23,29
Making mistakes is a necessary part of human growth

220
0:7:23,29 --> 0:7:23,949
Without making mistakes

221
0:7:23,949 --> 0:7:25,64
You can never truly grow

222
0:7:25,64 --> 0:7:29,52
That means life is always full of various random events

223
0:7:29,52 --> 0:7:31,27
All sorts of unfortunate events

224
0:7:31,27 --> 0:7:32,75
More than our plans

225
0:7:32,75 --> 0:7:35,74
Like how I had everything planned out perfectly for today

226
0:7:35,74 --> 0:7:37,2
I had already made it to the waiting room

227
0:7:37,2 --> 0:7:38,14
I had even gone through the ticket check

228
0:7:38,14 --> 0:7:39,6
I was about to board the train

229
0:7:39,6 --> 0:7:42,5
but then a sudden call brought me back

230
0:7:42,5 --> 0:7:43,84
it completely broke all the rules

231
0:7:43,84 --> 0:7:45,76
when I came back

232
0:7:45,76 --> 0:7:48,1
I almost forgot about taking the subway

233
0:7:48,1 --> 0:7:50,39
and ended up choosing to grab a taxi outside the station

234
0:7:50,39 --> 0:7:51,399
grabbing a taxi outside the station

235
0:7:51,399 --> 0:7:55,49
I forgot that taxis aren't allowed within a few kilometers around Beijing South Station.

236
0:7:55,49 --> 0:7:56,65
So I had to walk out.

237
0:7:56,65 --> 0:7:57,25
For several kilometers.

238
0:7:57,25 --> 0:7:58,65
Then I finally got a cab.

239
0:7:58,65 --> 0:8:1,42
And I was going against the rush hour traffic.

240
0:8:1,42 --> 0:8:2,96
Finally got home.

241
0:8:2,96 --> 0:8:3,92
To deal with this.

242
0:8:3,92 --> 0:8:5,48
Spent the whole morning at the hospital.

243
0:8:5,48 --> 0:8:8,68
So handling these things is quite a hassle.

244
0:8:8,68 --> 0:8:10,23
It's really tough

245
0:8:10,23 --> 0:8:13,13
But these experiences can truly enrich my skills

246
0:8:13,13 --> 0:8:15,94
Because in life, you realize that things are unpredictable

247
0:8:15,94 --> 0:8:17,58
Many things are like this

248
0:8:17,58 --> 0:8:19,68
Many things come from mistakes

249
0:8:19,68 --> 0:8:21,18
From the chaos

250
0:8:21,18 --> 0:8:23,49
That's where you find the value of life

251
0:8:23,49 --> 0:8:26,21
That's where you discover what it means to be human

252
0:8:26,21 --> 0:8:30,13
This joy lies in the ups and downs of life

253
0:8:30,13 --> 0:8:31,21
You need to tell others

254
0:8:31,21 --> 0:8:32,81
or they won't find it interesting

255
0:8:32,81 --> 0:8:34,719
What happened, what's going on?

256
0:8:34,719 --> 0:8:35,519
What's up with Brother Rong?

257
0:8:35,519 --> 0:8:37,839
Is Brother Rong sick, or is it his family?

258
0:8:37,839 --> 0:8:39,39
What's the story?

259
0:8:39,39 --> 0:8:41,67
It only becomes a story when you tell it

260
0:8:41,67 --> 0:8:43,33
It only becomes interesting then

261
0:8:43,33 --> 0:8:45,9
Of course, Brother Long is fine

262
0:8:45,9 --> 0:8:47,1
Brother Long is still in good shape

263
0:8:47,1 --> 0:8:49,28
but he's getting older

264
0:8:49,28 --> 0:8:51,1
and so are the family members

265
0:8:51,1 --> 0:8:53,46
when parents have a headache or a cold

266
0:8:53,46 --> 0:8:54,86
it gets really tough

267
0:8:54,86 --> 0:8:55,72
it's uncomfortable

268
0:8:55,72 --> 0:8:56,28
it hurts

269
0:8:56,28 --> 0:8:57,74
these things are quite common

270
0:8:57,74 --> 0:8:58,78
so, talking about it

271
0:8:58,78 --> 0:9:2,14
Why does every time I go out have to be so thrilling?

272
0:9:2,14 --> 0:9:4,43
I'm afraid something might happen to my parents.

273
0:9:4,43 --> 0:9:5,89
I'm worried about my child's health.

274
0:9:5,89 --> 0:9:6,69
That's exactly it.

275
0:9:6,69 --> 0:9:8,46
At least the child has his mother to take care of him.

276
0:9:8,46 --> 0:9:10,3
My parents can only rely on each other for support.

277
0:9:10,3 --> 0:9:11,94
If I could take care of them,

278
0:9:11,94 --> 0:9:13,25
I would have to be around.

279
0:9:13,25 --> 0:9:15,1
So, even though I can say,

280
0:9:15,1 --> 0:9:17,5
I have visas for many places,

281
0:9:17,5 --> 0:9:20,61
I wouldn't dare to plan a two-month trip in Europe,

282
0:9:20,61 --> 0:9:22,56
a three-month road trip in North America,

283
0:9:22,56 --> 0:9:24,36
or a 90-day stay in Japan,

284
0:9:24,36 --> 0:9:26,97
or even a 45-day stay in Xiamen.

285
0:9:26,97 --> 0:9:29,11
I can only say I'll stay here for three or four days,

286
0:9:29,11 --> 0:9:30,7
or five days there.

287
0:9:30,7 --> 0:9:30,65
At most,

288
0:9:30,65 --> 0:9:31,63
a week or two.

289
0:9:31,63 --> 0:9:32,29
Right?

290
0:9:32,29 --> 0:9:34,5
So I always travel like this.

291
0:9:34,5 --> 0:9:34,96
There's no other way.

292
0:9:34,96 --> 0:9:36,16
This is life.

293
0:9:36,16 --> 0:9:37,74
This is real life.

294
0:9:37,74 --> 0:9:39,68
Real life means making mistakes.

295
0:9:39,68 --> 0:9:41,81
Real life also means being tolerant of mistakes.

296
0:9:41,81 --> 0:9:43,41
Only a life that allows for mistakes,

297
0:9:43,41 --> 0:9:45,81
a life where you make mistakes, is a real life.

298
0:9:45,81 --> 0:9:49,33
So the core of what you need to do in your show is to let others see you.

299
0:9:49,33 --> 0:9:50,7
You are an ordinary person.

300
0:9:50,7 --> 0:9:53,2
You are someone who makes mistakes.

301
0:9:53,2 --> 0:9:55,64
You are someone who has flaws in life.

302
0:9:55,64 --> 0:9:57,14
You need to amplify these aspects.

303
0:9:57,14 --> 0:9:58,0
That's what makes the story.

304
0:9:58,0 --> 0:9:58,84
That's what makes it interesting.

305
0:9:58,84 --> 0:9:59,82
That's what draws people in.
