0:0:0,94 --> 0:0:2,4
Hi everyone,

2
0:0:2,4 --> 0:0:4,2
this should be episode 485.

3
0:0:4,2 --> 0:0:5,33
let's get into the chat.

4
0:0:5,33 --> 0:0:8,81
In this episode, we'll talk about my love history.

5
0:0:8,81 --> 0:0:12,9
My love life is like a pile of shit, to be honest.

6
0:0:12,9 --> 0:0:16,24
But I believe that pursuing love in itself isn't wrong.

7
0:0:16,24 --> 0:0:17,8
Speaking of our show,

8
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:20,28
we've always promoted the right values,

9
0:0:20,28 --> 0:0:22,52
guiding everyone towards the right path.

10
0:0:22,52 --> 0:0:23,6
Well, how to put it

11
0:0:23,6 --> 0:0:25,28
a straightforward path in life

12
0:0:25,28 --> 0:0:27,12
breaking some fixations

13
0:0:27,12 --> 0:0:29,58
some of my stubborn beliefs and superstitions

14
0:0:29,58 --> 0:0:32,89
to achieve a state of inner purity and balance

15
0:0:32,89 --> 0:0:35,99
in these 26 years of my life

16
0:0:35,99 --> 0:0:37,37
although I'm 40 now

17
0:0:37,37 --> 0:0:39,73
but actually, starting from the first

18
0:0:39,73 --> 0:0:42,29
real, physical girlfriend

19
0:0:42,29 --> 0:0:43,61
It started when I was 14

20
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:45,92
But I began to talk about it

21
0:0:45,92 --> 0:0:47,18
Thinking about these questions

22
0:0:47,18 --> 0:0:49,5
Actually, it began when I was four or five

23
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:51,29
But even in kindergarten, there was this urge

24
0:0:51,29 --> 0:0:53,97
By the time I started primary school, at six or seven

25
0:0:53,97 --> 0:0:55,34
It's not that I was precocious

26
0:0:55,34 --> 0:0:58,86
This liking for the opposite sex had already begun

27
0:0:58,86 --> 0:1:0,36
But as a kid, you wouldn't do anything about it

28
0:1:0,36 --> 0:1:2,18
But it wasn't until I was 14

29
0:1:2,18 --> 0:1:3,94
when I was pushed over by a senior

30
0:1:3,94 --> 0:1:6,22
that all sorts of messy things started happening

31
0:1:6,22 --> 0:1:8,24
So it all began from that day

32
0:1:8,24 --> 0:1:9,77
and it's been 26 years since then

33
0:1:9,77 --> 0:1:12,49
So in these 26 years of life

34
0:1:12,49 --> 0:1:14,69
what have I learned?

35
0:1:15,49 --> 0:1:16,33
Absolutely nothing

36
0:1:17,37 --> 0:1:20,32
because I realized that all these things don't really matter

37
0:1:20,32 --> 0:1:22,52
Whether he gets it or not

38
0:1:22,52 --> 0:1:24,86
is actually a form of self-attachment

39
0:1:24,86 --> 0:1:26,46
an excess of self-consciousness

40
0:1:26,46 --> 0:1:30,349
stemming from one's own fantasies and self-deception

41
0:1:30,349 --> 0:1:32,609
A lot of self-deception forms the essence of love

42
0:1:32,609 --> 0:1:36,44
We say that everyone has a different view on love

43
0:1:36,44 --> 0:1:38,42
and thus adopts different life strategies

44
0:1:38,42 --> 0:1:40,52
which ultimately lead to different outcomes

45
0:1:40,52 --> 0:1:41,6
But in my opinion

46
0:1:41,6 --> 0:1:43,59
Everyone's ultimate outcome is the same

47
0:1:43,59 --> 0:1:45,23
it's death

48
0:1:45,23 --> 0:1:48,29
so death is a gradual process

49
0:1:48,29 --> 0:1:50,23
gradually you become old

50
0:1:50,23 --> 0:1:51,39
nobody likes you anymore

51
0:1:51,39 --> 0:1:52,83
you become lonely

52
0:1:52,83 --> 0:1:53,99
nobody comes to visit you

53
0:1:53,99 --> 0:1:54,85
and finally, death arrives

54
0:1:54,85 --> 0:1:55,67
so to speak

55
0:1:55,67 --> 0:1:58,68
The final stage of life can be quite tragic.

56
0:1:58,68 --> 0:2:2,72
So, to combat the hardships of the last few years of life,

57
0:2:2,72 --> 0:2:5,68
you hope to find someone to share your life with,

58
0:2:5,68 --> 0:2:8,88
someone to help raise a child,

59
0:2:8,88 --> 0:2:11,12
so they can take care of you in your old age,

60
0:2:11,12 --> 0:2:11,95
visit you,

61
0:2:11,95 --> 0:2:15,25
but these are all forms of hypothetical value investments,

62
0:2:15,25 --> 0:2:18,73
meaning they may not necessarily lead to the desired outcome,

63
0:2:18,73 --> 0:2:20,37
and your investment might fail.

64
0:2:20,37 --> 0:2:22,69
The person who might end up loving you the most

65
0:2:22,69 --> 0:2:24,73
could be the one who leaves you

66
0:2:24,73 --> 0:2:27,47
Another thing is that your children might be very busy with work

67
0:2:27,47 --> 0:2:28,97
and they might not even live in the same city as you

68
0:2:28,97 --> 0:2:30,99
and they might not make it in time to see you for the last time

69
0:2:30,99 --> 0:2:31,87
Even if they are in the same city

70
0:2:31,87 --> 0:2:33,11
they could be delayed by traffic

71
0:2:33,11 --> 0:2:35,69
These are all things that have actually happened in my family

72
0:2:35,69 --> 0:2:36,89
So when I talk about this

73
0:2:36,89 --> 0:2:39,37
We find that a large number of people in life

74
0:2:39,37 --> 0:2:42,15
spend a significant amount of time pursuing love

75
0:2:42,15 --> 0:2:46,5
or seeking a perfect romantic partner

76
0:2:46,5 --> 0:2:48,97
or wanting to have a perfect relationship

77
0:2:48,97 --> 0:2:51,44
From a sociological perspective

78
0:2:51,44 --> 0:2:53,78
people look for a mate

79
0:2:53,78 --> 0:2:55,32
seek a marriage partner

80
0:2:55,32 --> 0:2:56,0
and build a family

81
0:2:56,0 --> 0:2:59,2
This is a perfectly normal stage

82
0:2:59,2 --> 0:3:0,84
But from my perspective

83
0:3:0,84 --> 0:3:2,6
let me analyze it for everyone

84
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:3,96
why there are some pitfalls in pursuing love

85
0:3:3,96 --> 0:3:5,12
that are particularly easy to fall into

86
0:3:5,12 --> 0:3:6,8
one of them is the idea of seeking the perfect match

87
0:3:6,8 --> 0:3:9,2
looking for an ideal and flawless partner

88
0:3:9,2 --> 0:3:12,5
first, you need to understand one thing

89
0:3:12,5 --> 0:3:14,52
you are not perfect

90
0:3:14,52 --> 0:3:16,24
and neither is anyone else

91
0:3:16,24 --> 0:3:19,72
You're not just a pretty face.

92
0:3:19,72 --> 0:3:21,22
So, it's a matter of being born at the wrong time.

93
0:3:21,22 --> 0:3:22,38
People often say,

94
0:3:22,38 --> 0:3:23,68
Bro Rong was really handsome in his youth.

95
0:3:23,68 --> 0:3:25,62
Actually, Bro Rong's looks back then,

96
0:3:25,62 --> 0:3:27,79
Let's be honest here,

97
0:3:27,79 --> 0:3:28,919
Putting aside the makeup,

98
0:3:28,919 --> 0:3:32,73
All the lighting and photo editing effects,

99
0:3:32,73 --> 0:3:34,67
My looks are actually just average, about a six.

100
0:3:34,67 --> 0:3:35,67
At most, six points

101
0:3:35,67 --> 0:3:37,5
You could say seven points if you want

102
0:3:37,5 --> 0:3:38,45
But let's be honest

103
0:3:38,45 --> 0:3:40,55
A ten is absolutely stunning

104
0:3:40,55 --> 0:3:42,9
A nine is generally attractive

105
0:3:42,9 --> 0:3:44,87
An eight can already rack up a few million followers on Douyin

106
0:3:44,87 --> 0:3:46,3
So for a seven

107
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:48,63
We can say they're good-looking enough to turn heads

108
0:3:48,63 --> 0:3:51,9
I was at most passable when I was young

109
0:3:51,9 --> 0:3:52,35
So it's six points

110
0:3:52,35 --> 0:3:53,91
Now, I'm older and heavier

111
0:3:53,91 --> 0:3:55,71
And there are wrinkles too

112
0:3:55,71 --> 0:3:58,3
Plus, the neck isn't visible anymore

113
0:3:58,3 --> 0:3:58,47
Right?

114
0:3:58,47 --> 0:3:59,19
Considering many factors

115
0:3:59,19 --> 0:4:1,24
So the current score is four points

116
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:3,8
If we add this four to the six

117
0:4:3,8 --> 0:4:3,92
We can take the average

118
0:4:3,92 --> 0:4:5,1
I'm just a five out of ten in looks.

119
0:4:5,1 --> 0:4:5,8
Just a five out of ten.

120
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:7,8
This person is just average, you know.

121
0:4:7,8 --> 0:4:9,29
Most people are average.

122
0:4:9,29 --> 0:4:12,769
But actually, reaching the average level is already pretty good.

123
0:4:12,769 --> 0:4:15,369
But in our daily lives,

124
0:4:15,369 --> 0:4:19,14
we five-out-of-ten people often idealize those who are seven or eight out of ten,

125
0:4:19,14 --> 0:4:22,26
and set them as our fantasy and pursuit targets.

126
0:4:22,26 --> 0:4:25,99
This creates a significant misconception about ourselves.

127
0:4:25,99 --> 0:4:28,71
I realized that I had once pursued someone who was his ex.

128
0:4:28,71 --> 0:4:29,91
Ultimately speaking,

129
0:4:29,91 --> 0:4:31,69
the outcomes aren't usually great.

130
0:4:31,69 --> 0:4:33,89
It's not like they all married into perfect situations.

131
0:4:33,89 --> 0:4:34,81
Some might even get divorced,

132
0:4:34,81 --> 0:4:36,21
or their husbands might be worse off than me.

133
0:4:36,21 --> 0:4:37,33
Some might be better than me,

134
0:4:37,33 --> 0:4:38,95
but overall,

135
0:4:38,95 --> 0:4:43,87
when it comes to people who are more than one point higher in looks than you,

136
0:4:43,87 --> 0:4:45,53
It's usually not easy to succeed.

137
0:4:45,53 --> 0:4:47,25
Generally speaking, it's not easy to succeed.

138
0:4:47,25 --> 0:4:49,11
When you're at a six, finding someone at a five is no problem.

139
0:4:49,11 --> 0:4:50,33
Finding someone at a six is also no issue.

140
0:4:50,33 --> 0:4:53,12
But in all my relationships,

141
0:4:53,12 --> 0:4:54,68
As everyone knows, the people I've dated,

142
0:4:54,68 --> 0:4:57,17
Let's just say the people I've dated,

143
0:4:57,17 --> 0:5:1,43
Actually, I'm just seven numbers away from hitting a hundred.

144
0:5:1,43 --> 0:5:6,939
So I've managed to achieve something truly through my own efforts.

145
0:5:6,939 --> 0:5:9,459
This person obtained a sample space

146
0:5:9,459 --> 0:5:10,859
as a form of social survey

147
0:5:10,859 --> 0:5:12,19
which is quite accurate

148
0:5:12,19 --> 0:5:15,25
and I have moved several times

149
0:5:15,25 --> 0:5:16,79
but my appearance hasn't changed

150
0:5:16,79 --> 0:5:17,87
nor has my height

151
0:5:17,87 --> 0:5:19,86
my weight only started to increase

152
0:5:19,86 --> 0:5:21,98
after I got married

153
0:5:21,98 --> 0:5:23,78
so during the time before marriage

154
0:5:23,78 --> 0:5:25,28
It has been in a relatively stable state

155
0:5:25,28 --> 0:5:28,1
120 to 130 pounds, or even a bit less

156
0:5:28,1 --> 0:5:29,74
So, a guy weighing around 100 pounds

157
0:5:29,74 --> 0:5:30,99
With a face score of six

158
0:5:30,99 --> 0:5:33,27
A 78-inch-tall man from the north

159
0:5:33,27 --> 0:5:34,59
What kind of person should we be talking about

160
0:5:34,59 --> 0:5:36,12
He is just an average guy

161
0:5:36,12 --> 0:5:37,6
No matter if it’s five or six

162
0:5:37,6 --> 0:5:39,36
But this result will tell us

163
0:5:39,36 --> 0:5:42,54
I've noticed that among all the people I've pursued, none of them have had perfect looks.

164
0:5:42,54 --> 0:5:44,8
There are those with very good looks, though.

165
0:5:44,8 --> 0:5:45,82
And there are plenty with average good looks.

166
0:5:45,82 --> 0:5:47,54
Those with decent looks make up the majority.

167
0:5:47,54 --> 0:5:49,14
People with somewhat average looks also make up a large part.

168
0:5:49,14 --> 0:5:51,3
As I get older,

169
0:5:51,3 --> 0:5:52,54
I realize that the people I've been with,

170
0:5:52,54 --> 0:5:56,109
most of them had looks that were just average or even below average.

171
0:5:56,109 --> 0:5:58,299
In other words, as my looks age,

172
0:5:58,299 --> 0:6:1,119
The people who pursue you might not necessarily be the ones you can end up with.

173
0:6:1,119 --> 0:6:3,559
At the beginning, for example, you might be a six.

174
0:6:3,559 --> 0:6:4,619
While the other person is an eight.

175
0:6:4,619 --> 0:6:5,259
Or a seven.

176
0:6:5,259 --> 0:6:6,21
Or even a five.

177
0:6:6,21 --> 0:6:7,29
A six is still a six.

178
0:6:7,29 --> 0:6:8,7
In such cases, there are many scenarios.

179
0:6:8,7 --> 0:6:11,36
But when your attractiveness drops to a five or a four,

180
0:6:11,36 --> 0:6:14,4
Your partner's attractiveness will also decrease accordingly.

181
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:16,1
Especially in recent years,

182
0:6:16,1 --> 0:6:19,18
I've noticed why dating has become increasingly difficult.

183
0:6:19,18 --> 0:6:21,22
It's because men always seem to prefer women in their twenties.

184
0:6:21,22 --> 0:6:23,46
But as you get further from your twenties,

185
0:6:23,46 --> 0:6:25,24
it starts as just a year or two difference,

186
0:6:25,24 --> 0:6:26,72
but over time, it becomes five years,

187
0:6:26,72 --> 0:6:27,16
ten years,

188
0:6:27,16 --> 0:6:28,9
and eventually, twenty years.

189
0:6:28,9 --> 0:6:33,28
This makes it hard to have a normal dating experience.

190
0:6:33,28 --> 0:6:36,94
He would prefer someone who is significantly older than him.

191
0:6:36,94 --> 0:6:39,52
We often talk about the golden age gap, you know.

192
0:6:39,52 --> 0:6:40,94
About 5 to 8 years.

193
0:6:40,94 --> 0:6:42,74
Some say it’s 3 to 10 years.

194
0:6:42,74 --> 0:6:44,26
Anyway, anything over 15 years is a bit much.

195
0:6:44,26 --> 0:6:45,42
That’s a bit scary.

196
0:6:45,42 --> 0:6:46,34
Just imagine.

197
0:6:46,34 --> 0:6:48,68
Sometimes I think about dating someone who’s 20 years old.

198
0:6:48,68 --> 0:6:51,38
What’s the difference between liking someone who’s 60?

199
0:6:51,38 --> 0:6:51,7
Is that right?

200
0:6:51,7 --> 0:6:52,7
So, in many cases,

201
0:6:52,7 --> 0:6:55,6
At 60, that would be old enough to be everyone's mom, right?

202
0:6:55,6 --> 0:6:57,23
Or even grandparents.

203
0:6:57,23 --> 0:6:58,91
So, as age increases,

204
0:6:58,91 --> 0:7:0,799
I've noticed,

205
0:7:1,359 --> 0:7:4,719
How can one still maintain an active sex life?

206
0:7:4,719 --> 0:7:6,959
It's about being more open-minded about gender.

207
0:7:7,96 --> 0:7:9,18
Of course, I'm just joking.

208
0:7:9,18 --> 0:7:10,56
But let's be honest

209
0:7:10,56 --> 0:7:14,2
Your previous high standards for looks

210
0:7:14,2 --> 0:7:16,0
Don't aim for someone who is 1 or 2 levels above you

211
0:7:16,0 --> 0:7:16,96
Or at least on the same level

212
0:7:16,96 --> 0:7:19,26
Now you should aim for someone 1 or 2 levels below you

213
0:7:19,26 --> 0:7:21,38
You always want someone in their twenties

214
0:7:21,38 --> 0:7:23,2
But now you should look for someone in their thirties

215
0:7:23,2 --> 0:7:23,78
Or even in their mid-thirties

216
0:7:23,78 --> 0:7:25,58
But there's an issue here

217
0:7:25,58 --> 0:7:27,46
You'll find that people in their mid-thirties

218
0:7:27,46 --> 0:7:28,99
are mostly married

219
0:7:28,99 --> 0:7:30,3
if they're married

220
0:7:30,3 --> 0:7:30,79
or divorced

221
0:7:30,79 --> 0:7:32,7
or still single

222
0:7:32,7 --> 0:7:34,68
but let's talk about a common social misconception

223
0:7:34,68 --> 0:7:36,22
a common social misconception

224
0:7:36,22 --> 0:7:38,58
that if someone is in their thirties and still single

225
0:7:38,58 --> 0:7:39,74
and has never been in a relationship

226
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:40,89
I wouldn't recommend you to look for someone like that

227
0:7:40,89 --> 0:7:45,41
because such people haven't established a proper perspective on relationships

228
0:7:45,41 --> 0:7:46,8
or values

229
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:49,34
of course, this is just an individual case

230
0:7:49,34 --> 0:7:52,72
but more people are looking forward to love entering their lives

231
0:7:52,72 --> 0:7:55,26
so I wish them all the best

232
0:7:55,26 --> 0:7:56,92
after all, life is short and fleeting

233
0:7:56,92 --> 0:7:57,58
it's all good

234
0:7:57,58 --> 0:7:59,28
but for more people

235
0:7:59,28 --> 0:8:0,68
People who have gone through a divorce

236
0:8:0,68 --> 0:8:3,759
or those who have been married

237
0:8:3,759 --> 0:8:6,81
their values in love generally remain quite stable

238
0:8:6,81 --> 0:8:8,53
most people after a divorce

239
0:8:8,53 --> 0:8:10,1
are less inclined to remarry

240
0:8:10,1 --> 0:8:11,27
there are still some who want to get married

241
0:8:11,27 --> 0:8:12,85
so overall

242
0:8:12,85 --> 0:8:14,9
to put it in the current context

243
0:8:14,9 --> 0:8:14,77
if you're looking for someone around 30 years old

244
0:8:14,77 --> 0:8:16,21
People over 35

245
0:8:16,21 --> 0:8:18,57
From my current romantic experience

246
0:8:18,57 --> 0:8:22,49
Everyone generally knows what they want

247
0:8:22,49 --> 0:8:24,5
What they themselves want

248
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:25,27
However

249
0:8:25,27 --> 0:8:27,11
When it comes to the opposite sex at different age groups

250
0:8:27,11 --> 0:8:29,17
What’s needed is just one thing in common

251
0:8:29,17 --> 0:8:30,31
And that’s money

252
0:8:30,31 --> 0:8:34,91
There’s really nothing wrong with that

253
0:8:34,91 --> 0:8:37,729
We've talked about how men deceive for affection and women for money.

254
0:8:37,729 --> 0:8:39,189
This is quite a common thing.

255
0:8:39,189 --> 0:8:40,289
My partner,

256
0:8:40,289 --> 0:8:46,159
Many of my friends have gone to YC,

257
0:8:46,159 --> 0:8:50,5
There are more female streamers,

258
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:52,33
So their perspectives on life,

259
0:8:52,33 --> 0:8:53,77
Actually resemble mine from over a decade ago,

260
0:8:53,77 --> 0:8:55,61
Similar to what I saw in the 'mistress training classes' twenty years ago,

261
0:8:55,61 --> 0:8:58,739
There's no difference compared to those college classmates of mine.

262
0:8:58,739 --> 0:9:2,359
Society is constantly moving forward.

263
0:9:6,78 --> 0:9:8,82
So, as many men get older,

264
0:9:8,82 --> 0:9:9,98
they use money to buy youth,

265
0:9:9,98 --> 0:9:12,26
spending it on young women.

266
0:9:12,26 --> 0:9:14,8
This is a natural rebalancing in society.

267
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:17,16
It’s not necessarily a vile phenomenon.

268
0:9:17,16 --> 0:9:18,86
It existed in ancient times as well.

269
0:9:18,86 --> 0:9:21,17
It’s just that modern people might face more constraints.

270
0:9:21,17 --> 0:9:23,65
Modern people can find substitutes for sex and love.

271
0:9:23,65 --> 0:9:24,61
There will be a bit more of that

272
0:9:24,61 --> 0:9:26,13
So when facing a single life

273
0:9:26,13 --> 0:9:27,49
He won't be particularly bored

274
0:9:27,49 --> 0:9:29,53
But from the perspective of companionship

275
0:9:29,53 --> 0:9:30,61
You need to be realistic

276
0:9:30,61 --> 0:9:32,95
I think the most practical point is

277
0:9:32,95 --> 0:9:35,95
You should look for someone with a lower appearance score than yourself

278
0:9:35,95 --> 0:9:39,45
But that doesn't necessarily mean there will be love

279
0:9:40,65 --> 0:9:44,54
It's about you thinking you're reaching down

280
0:9:44,54 --> 0:9:47,18
Just like for a long time

281
0:9:47,18 --> 0:9:48,98
Due to the unstable income

282
0:9:48,98 --> 0:9:50,88
Because I was always taking shortcuts

283
0:9:50,88 --> 0:9:54,0
My life was moving back and forth between different countries

284
0:9:54,0 --> 0:9:56,52
I often dreamt of being abroad

285
0:9:56,52 --> 0:9:58,56
Spending the whole day looking for a place to rent and a job

286
0:9:58,56 --> 0:10:0,16
Begging on the streets all day

287
0:10:0,16 --> 0:10:0,98
Or committing theft

288
0:10:0,98 --> 0:10:2,2
Dreams like these

289
0:10:2,2 --> 0:10:4,95
It shows that I am deeply afraid of this impoverished life.

290
0:10:4,95 --> 0:10:6,77
I am truly terrified and scared of it.

291
0:10:6,77 --> 0:10:9,96
In reality, I have never been so desperate

292
0:10:9,96 --> 0:10:12,32
that I had to resort to stealing or begging on the streets.

293
0:10:12,32 --> 0:10:14,14
Throughout different stages of my life,

294
0:10:14,14 --> 0:10:15,53
there have been times when I lacked money,

295
0:10:15,53 --> 0:10:16,57
and times when I didn't lack it.

296
0:10:16,57 --> 0:10:19,11
But in most cases, it hasn't come to the point of being in debt,

297
0:10:19,11 --> 0:10:22,1
or having issues with basic necessities like food and clothing.

298
0:10:22,1 --> 0:10:24,66
So it affects life and normal protein intake.

299
0:10:24,66 --> 0:10:25,22
No, it doesn't.

300
0:10:25,22 --> 0:10:25,73
Right?

301
0:10:25,73 --> 0:10:27,33
A lot of times,

302
0:10:27,33 --> 0:10:30,33
we might over-analyze things,

303
0:10:30,33 --> 0:10:33,16
pushing them into the subconscious part of our mind.

304
0:10:33,16 --> 0:10:34,34
Later, I found out,

305
0:10:34,34 --> 0:10:36,8
it really doesn't matter how you approach it,

306
0:10:36,8 --> 0:10:37,6
no matter how much you lose yourself.

307
0:10:37,6 --> 0:10:38,48
It's about self-deprecation

308
0:10:38,48 --> 0:10:39,28
looking down on oneself

309
0:10:39,28 --> 0:10:41,48
because I've always looked down on myself

310
0:10:41,48 --> 0:10:42,8
even when I was young

311
0:10:42,8 --> 0:10:43,68
and even as I grew older

312
0:10:43,68 --> 0:10:45,12
I've been in a state of self-contempt

313
0:10:45,12 --> 0:10:46,76
because if someone has self-respect

314
0:10:46,76 --> 0:10:49,6
or is particularly narcissistic

315
0:10:49,6 --> 0:10:52,14
they would present themselves with a flawless image to the world

316
0:10:52,14 --> 0:10:54,22
And I always have a messy appearance

317
0:10:54,22 --> 0:10:56,3
The reason for my messy appearance

318
0:10:56,3 --> 0:10:57,94
is not entirely due to laziness

319
0:10:57,94 --> 0:11:0,28
but because of my feeling of unworthiness

320
0:11:0,28 --> 0:11:4,52
I believe I cannot provide a stable and happy family life

321
0:11:4,52 --> 0:11:8,62
for a normal, excellent woman

322
0:11:8,62 --> 0:11:10,14
In reality

323
0:11:10,14 --> 0:11:14,49
this has proven to be true

324
0:11:14,49 --> 0:11:16,149
as I find it hard to adapt to married life

325
0:11:16,149 --> 0:11:18,94
Or, in terms of my material income,

326
0:11:18,94 --> 0:11:20,9
it might be sufficient for you,

327
0:11:20,9 --> 0:11:22,42
but when it comes to spiritual aspects,

328
0:11:22,42 --> 0:11:24,66
it might not be enough for you.

329
0:11:25,14 --> 0:11:26,94
This is a modest way of putting it.

330
0:11:26,94 --> 0:11:29,64
Because you might not be able to satisfy my spiritual and lifestyle needs,

331
0:11:29,64 --> 0:11:32,62
nor can you meet my material and physical needs.

332
0:11:32,62 --> 0:11:35,8
So, this often leads to a significant discrepancy.

333
0:11:35,8 --> 0:11:37,5
What is this significant discrepancy?

334
0:11:37,5 --> 0:11:39,97
In reality, when you find someone compatible with you

335
0:11:39,97 --> 0:11:41,33
you have to pretend

336
0:11:41,33 --> 0:11:44,14
you have to act like you really care about them

337
0:11:44,14 --> 0:11:46,46
but everyone has different requirements

338
0:11:46,46 --> 0:11:47,66
for example, the people around me

339
0:11:47,66 --> 0:11:50,1
the working women I interact with now

340
0:11:50,1 --> 0:11:53,12
they hope they can work less

341
0:11:53,12 --> 0:11:55,3
and be supported by someone so they don’t have to work so hard

342
0:11:55,3 --> 0:11:58,18
but in fact, they wouldn’t truly seek out such a life

343
0:11:58,18 --> 0:12:0,22
But what if I seek out a female entrepreneur?

344
0:12:0,22 --> 0:12:1,86
In terms of wealth, the income is equal.

345
0:12:1,86 --> 0:12:3,3
But female entrepreneurs,

346
0:12:3,3 --> 0:12:5,64
are often unwilling to be dominated by men.

347
0:12:5,64 --> 0:12:6,76
They've reached this level,

348
0:12:6,76 --> 0:12:8,579
they've already made their money,

349
0:12:8,579 --> 0:12:10,319
why would they want to be dominated by men?

350
0:12:10,319 --> 0:12:12,139
I'm being quite modest here,

351
0:12:12,139 --> 0:12:13,499
I don't mean they don't listen to men at all.

352
0:12:13,499 --> 0:12:16,35
Instead, they want everything to revolve around him

353
0:12:16,35 --> 0:12:19,65
using his ideas as the starting point

354
0:12:19,65 --> 0:12:20,59
this person

355
0:12:20,59 --> 0:12:22,22
no matter how much effort is made to look after his interests

356
0:12:22,22 --> 0:12:23,14
I often tell you

357
0:12:23,14 --> 0:12:24,88
Sister Cayenne often tells me

358
0:12:24,88 --> 0:12:25,94
Let’s go somewhere to play

359
0:12:25,94 --> 0:12:26,94
Your flight is booked

360
0:12:26,94 --> 0:12:28,88
and then everything is arranged

361
0:12:28,88 --> 0:12:30,12
I said I still have a son, you know.

362
0:12:30,12 --> 0:12:30,4
Right?

363
0:12:30,4 --> 0:12:31,6
I can't just leave whenever I want.

364
0:12:31,6 --> 0:12:34,4
So, a lot of the time, he won't care about you anymore.

365
0:12:34,4 --> 0:12:35,36
What's your situation?

366
0:12:35,36 --> 0:12:36,2
Are you willing or not?

367
0:12:36,2 --> 0:12:37,9
If you can stay with me, then do.

368
0:12:37,9 --> 0:12:39,3
As long as you look good.

369
0:12:39,3 --> 0:12:40,6
If you don't look good, that won't do.

370
0:12:40,6 --> 0:12:41,9
You're going to the gym, right?

371
0:12:41,9 --> 0:12:43,88
But for me,

372
0:12:44,24 --> 0:12:45,62
Do I really need to bother you?

373
0:12:45,62 --> 0:12:46,46
Isn't that right?

374
0:12:46,46 --> 0:12:48,28
The biggest issue is,

375
0:12:48,28 --> 0:12:50,4
Once you become an entrepreneur,

376
0:12:50,4 --> 0:12:53,2
You're less willing to help others,

377
0:12:53,2 --> 0:12:54,24
That's the state of affairs.

378
0:12:54,24 --> 0:12:55,72
If you talk about my current state,

379
0:12:55,72 --> 0:12:56,42
Content with a modest fortune

380
0:12:56,42 --> 0:12:58,36
Let's just say yes

381
0:12:58,36 --> 0:13:1,64
A bit more upscale middle class or slightly less wealthy people

382
0:13:1,64 --> 0:13:2,64
So no matter what

383
0:13:2,64 --> 0:13:3,44
If you do the math

384
0:13:3,44 --> 0:13:7,44
This is a freedom of choice

385
0:13:7,44 --> 0:13:10,22
You're less likely to follow the conventional path

386
0:13:10,22 --> 0:13:11,46
Because first, I don't work

387
0:13:11,46 --> 0:13:12,18
I don't work

388
0:13:12,18 --> 0:13:15,4
This gives you more free time to observe life

389
0:13:15,4 --> 0:13:16,56
to observe people like that

390
0:13:16,56 --> 0:13:17,96
to observe business models

391
0:13:17,96 --> 0:13:19,78
and more time to earn more money

392
0:13:19,78 --> 0:13:21,36
It's a positive cycle

393
0:13:21,36 --> 0:13:23,2
When it comes to emotional needs

394
0:13:23,2 --> 0:13:26,63
I can't just be there to accompany you back and forth to work

395
0:13:26,63 --> 0:13:28,79
We'll be there to take care of your emotions

396
0:13:28,79 --> 0:13:30,27
to take care of your needs in life

397
0:13:30,27 --> 0:13:32,329
Because we no longer have anything in common.

398
0:13:32,329 --> 0:13:34,569
So, when it comes to finding a girlfriend these days,

399
0:13:34,569 --> 0:13:35,369
Actually,

400
0:13:35,369 --> 0:13:36,769
Whether it's finding a girlfriend or a boyfriend,

401
0:13:36,769 --> 0:13:37,949
It's quite a challenging time.

402
0:13:37,949 --> 0:13:41,6
It's because my lifestyle and values have changed.

403
0:13:41,6 --> 0:13:42,74
If I were still working a regular job,

404
0:13:42,74 --> 0:13:44,78
I would just look for someone else who also works a regular job,

405
0:13:44,78 --> 0:13:45,88
And go on a blind date.

406
0:13:45,88 --> 0:13:48,11
or find someone who works at the same company

407
0:13:48,11 --> 0:13:51,25
like my parents, they work at a company in Yiyang

408
0:13:51,25 --> 0:13:53,29
they have many colleagues in common

409
0:13:53,29 --> 0:13:55,75
and share the same living environment

410
0:13:55,75 --> 0:13:56,91
the same boss

411
0:13:56,91 --> 0:13:57,67
it's a public institution, after all

412
0:13:57,67 --> 0:13:59,3
so a public institution is a place like that

413
0:13:59,3 --> 0:14:1,39
that's why my parents are employees of a public institution

414
0:14:2,669 --> 0:14:6,109
they have a simple personnel relationship, like those at a publishing house or bookstore

415
0:14:6,109 --> 0:14:8,509
So for me, it doesn't have much reference value.

416
0:14:8,509 --> 0:14:11,83
There's not much that I can apply from their life experiences to mine.

417
0:14:11,83 --> 0:14:12,81
This is quite rare.

418
0:14:12,81 --> 0:14:15,27
So I tend to be a rather cautious and solitary person.

419
0:14:15,27 --> 0:14:19,57
I don't really like to socialize with people who are in similar situations.

420
0:14:19,57 --> 0:14:20,33
I avoid socializing much.

421
0:14:20,33 --> 0:14:23,68
Now, most of my social interactions are with other UPloaders.

422
0:14:23,68 --> 0:14:25,1
And I'm particularly proactive about it.

423
0:14:25,1 --> 0:14:27,6
People might even question my motives.

424
0:14:27,6 --> 0:14:28,4
Actually, I just need social interaction.

425
0:14:28,4 --> 0:14:30,45
I don't need social interaction.

426
0:14:30,45 --> 0:14:31,21
They are two different things.

427
0:14:31,21 --> 0:14:32,61
But for me, they are the same thing.

428
0:14:32,61 --> 0:14:33,17
Right?

429
0:14:33,17 --> 0:14:34,45
So, ha ha.

430
0:14:34,45 --> 0:14:36,19
So, for others,

431
0:14:36,19 --> 0:14:37,85
My social interaction is social in the sense of being social.

432
0:14:37,85 --> 0:14:39,819
Not that other kind of social, right?

433
0:14:39,819 --> 0:14:41,939
So, that's how it is.

434
0:14:41,939 --> 0:14:45,42
Your needs don't match your actual situation.

435
0:14:45,42 --> 0:14:48,64
It's actually that your living conditions have changed.

436
0:14:48,64 --> 0:14:50,78
But when you were young, you never thought so.

437
0:14:50,78 --> 0:14:51,92
Because during the school years,

438
0:14:51,92 --> 0:14:54,91
as a student, you don't have to bear the financial pressure.

439
0:14:54,91 --> 0:14:56,33
Once you enter the workforce,

440
0:14:56,33 --> 0:14:59,7
sudden heavy social and financial pressures,

441
0:14:59,7 --> 0:15:0,75
along with family pressures, come crashing down on you.

442
0:15:0,75 --> 0:15:2,14
You don’t have the time to date.

443
0:15:2,14 --> 0:15:4,2
It becomes a quick pairing.

444
0:15:4,2 --> 0:15:6,66
So, ultimately, what determines the quality of your romantic relationships,

445
0:15:6,66 --> 0:15:9,59
is your income and your actual social status.

446
0:15:9,59 --> 0:15:10,81
In other words, the more money you have,

447
0:15:10,81 --> 0:15:13,63
the more time you have to think about it,

448
0:15:13,63 --> 0:15:15,69
how to deal with the opposite sex and such things.

449
0:15:15,69 --> 0:15:16,99
Of course, in your work,

450
0:15:16,99 --> 0:15:18,3
and during your studies

451
0:15:18,3 --> 0:15:20,7
Academics and work should be your top priorities.

452
0:15:20,7 --> 0:15:21,89
The issue is that you don’t have the time.

453
0:15:21,89 --> 0:15:24,11
So you don’t have the time to think about these things.

454
0:15:24,11 --> 0:15:25,97
But when you do have money,

455
0:15:25,97 --> 0:15:27,13
and the time,

456
0:15:27,13 --> 0:15:29,4
you’ll find that you’re old.

457
0:15:29,4 --> 0:15:30,44
People’s good looks fade,

458
0:15:30,44 --> 0:15:31,48
so you might look for someone younger,

459
0:15:31,48 --> 0:15:33,52
but younger people may see you as an elder.

460
0:15:33,52 --> 0:15:35,61
It depends on who you're looking for.

461
0:15:35,61 --> 0:15:37,17
People who work in the same field.

462
0:15:37,17 --> 0:15:38,41
They all have families.

463
0:15:38,41 --> 0:15:40,739
As for those who don't work, well,

464
0:15:40,739 --> 0:15:41,779
That would be different from you.

465
0:15:41,779 --> 0:15:43,459
For example, if you ask me to find other female content creators,

466
0:15:43,459 --> 0:15:45,279
Finding other female entrepreneurs would be quite normal.

467
0:15:45,279 --> 0:15:47,1
The issue here is about female content creators.

468
0:15:47,1 --> 0:15:48,45
They might think of different solutions.

469
0:15:48,45 --> 0:15:50,29
How do I deal with the top patron?

470
0:15:50,29 --> 0:15:52,65
Why do I just exploit my employees?

471
0:15:52,65 --> 0:15:54,18
So our thoughts are completely different.

472
0:15:54,18 --> 0:15:58,38
Successful women like this are sure to have more than one male partner.

473
0:15:58,38 --> 0:16:1,9
So why should I bother competing for that position?

474
0:16:1,9 --> 0:16:5,98
That’s why my relationship with many so-called successful women is

475
0:16:5,98 --> 0:16:6,89
like this,

476
0:16:6,89 --> 0:16:9,59
I am a good friend of theirs,

477
0:16:9,59 --> 0:16:16,619
but not a male pet for their entertainment, right?

478
0:16:16,619 --> 0:16:18,939
But I also want to be their male companion

479
0:16:18,939 --> 0:16:21,35
But I'm neither young enough nor good-looking enough

480
0:16:21,35 --> 0:16:22,91
However, as a close friend

481
0:16:22,91 --> 0:16:25,11
I haven’t been able to resolve the issue of sexual life

482
0:16:25,11 --> 0:16:26,42
So this is quite a dilemma

483
0:16:26,42 --> 0:16:28,7
So you often see me on Steam

484
0:16:28,7 --> 0:16:31,1
Or logging into various games

485
0:16:31,1 --> 0:16:33,65
It becomes a need that isn’t met

486
0:16:33,65 --> 0:16:36,57
So often, the fulfillment of needs is unequal

487
0:16:36,57 --> 0:16:38,9
It's all a process of rebalancing.

488
0:16:38,9 --> 0:16:42,24
So I've noticed that all entrepreneurs, in the end,

489
0:16:42,24 --> 0:16:43,8
as they get older,

490
0:16:43,8 --> 0:16:44,68
their income increases,

491
0:16:44,68 --> 0:16:46,98
and the final outcome is always the same.

492
0:16:46,98 --> 0:16:49,62
So I won't spell it out; you know what it is.

493
0:16:49,62 --> 0:16:54,59
Often, social choices are not entirely up to you personally,

494
0:16:54,59 --> 0:16:58,99
and they're not something you can specifically envision when you're young.

495
0:16:58,99 --> 0:17:0,95
When you're older, you're left with only two options.

496
0:17:0,95 --> 0:17:1,71
One is NTR

497
0:17:1,71 --> 0:17:2,61
The other is keeping a mistress

498
0:17:2,61 --> 0:17:4,3
Well, there's nothing we can do about that

499
0:17:4,3 --> 0:17:6,519
Perhaps you could participate in both

500
0:17:6,519 --> 0:17:7,799
But similarly

501
0:17:7,799 --> 0:17:9,419
If you approach other entrepreneurs

502
0:17:9,419 --> 0:17:9,899
It's unlikely

503
0:17:9,899 --> 0:17:12,2
Because they also want to hire male models

504
0:17:12,2 --> 0:17:13,18
They also want to keep male companions

505
0:17:13,18 --> 0:17:13,82
It's the same.

506
0:17:13,82 --> 0:17:15,36
They also go after young boys.

507
0:17:15,36 --> 0:17:17,79
I also want to find young girls.

508
0:17:17,79 --> 0:17:18,399
So, it’s essentially the same.

509
0:17:18,399 --> 0:17:20,719
This society also takes your money,

510
0:17:20,719 --> 0:17:23,159
and channels it in a fresh way,

511
0:17:23,159 --> 0:17:26,15
feeding it back into the criminal underworld.

512
0:17:26,15 --> 0:17:28,79
So, this is the imbalance in human desires.

513
0:17:28,79 --> 0:17:31,15
So, pursuing love might be futile.

514
0:17:31,15 --> 0:17:33,71
Because of love, if you set aside social class,

515
0:17:33,71 --> 0:17:34,83
income level,

516
0:17:34,83 --> 0:17:36,51
and the person's lifestyle, it’s just talk.

517
0:17:36,51 --> 0:17:37,679
It’s all just talk.

518
0:17:37,679 --> 0:17:40,339
The only thing I’ve asked all the girls I’ve liked is,

519
0:17:40,339 --> 0:17:42,44
two are homemakers,

520
0:17:42,8 --> 0:17:44,78
and two are career women.

521
0:17:44,78 --> 0:17:46,4
The career women mostly work in offices,

522
0:17:46,4 --> 0:17:47,2
one is a civil servant.

523
0:17:47,2 --> 0:17:48,44
One is a career-oriented woman

524
0:17:48,44 --> 0:17:50,98
The two homemakers are both very capable

525
0:17:50,98 --> 0:17:52,74
But now they are abroad

526
0:17:52,74 --> 0:17:54,64
So they can only manage the household

527
0:17:54,64 --> 0:17:56,98
They really hope to return to the workforce

528
0:17:56,98 --> 0:17:59,44
So all the people I used to admire

529
0:17:59,44 --> 0:18:3,6
In the end, didn't actually do as well as me

530
0:18:3,6 --> 0:18:5,949
So when I pursued them back then

531
0:18:5,949 --> 0:18:7,969
I wasn't the right match for them

532
0:18:7,969 --> 0:18:10,889
The person they ultimately match with will certainly not be someone like me.

533
0:18:10,889 --> 0:18:13,34
So in my life, I want to tell you this:

534
0:18:13,34 --> 0:18:15,3
Love and career are separate things.

535
0:18:15,3 --> 0:18:18,22
You might far surpass the person you once liked.

536
0:18:18,22 --> 0:18:21,2
You might find yourself in a better situation than anyone else.

537
0:18:21,2 --> 0:18:22,91
So focus on living your best life.

538
0:18:22,91 --> 0:18:24,7
Just live your best life.

539
0:18:24,7 --> 0:18:26,15
As long as you acknowledge your current state.

540
0:18:26,15 --> 0:18:28,87
Solving the issue of love can actually be quite simple.

541
0:18:28,87 --> 0:18:30,28
I mean, speaking frankly

542
0:18:30,28 --> 0:18:31,68
I'm already an entrepreneur now

543
0:18:31,68 --> 0:18:33,84
I can leverage all sorts of administrative measures

544
0:18:33,84 --> 0:18:35,86
and use the various powers at my disposal

545
0:18:35,86 --> 0:18:37,68
to acquire more sexual resources

546
0:18:37,68 --> 0:18:39,54
whether it's through money or power

547
0:18:39,54 --> 0:18:41,34
or influence

548
0:18:42,62 --> 0:18:44,98
so what should a man ultimately strive for

549
0:18:44,98 --> 0:18:46,36
first and foremost, it should be a career

550
0:18:46,36 --> 0:18:47,98
When you can't pursue your career,

551
0:18:47,98 --> 0:18:49,839
then go after your leisure time,

552
0:18:49,839 --> 0:18:51,19
like fishing,

553
0:18:51,19 --> 0:18:52,359
or modifying cars,

554
0:18:52,359 --> 0:18:53,859
or playing video games, and so on.

555
0:18:53,859 --> 0:18:55,139
When you truly have a career,

556
0:18:55,139 --> 0:18:57,24
your life becomes the most fun game you can play.

557
0:18:57,24 --> 0:18:58,44
It's that simple.

558
0:18:58,44 --> 0:19:0,78
So my view on love changed later on.

559
0:19:0,78 --> 0:19:4,62
I used to be on the lookout for someone who loves me or someone I love.

560
0:19:4,62 --> 0:19:7,8
But later I realized that the people I love actually don't deserve me.

561
0:19:8,8 --> 0:19:9,84
They just have high looks.

562
0:19:9,84 --> 0:19:11,2
However, as we age,

563
0:19:11,2 --> 0:19:12,28
our looks fade too.

564
0:19:12,28 --> 0:19:13,9
I've dropped from a six to a four.

565
0:19:13,9 --> 0:19:16,34
They've gone from a seven or eight down to a five or six.

566
0:19:16,34 --> 0:19:17,22
No matter how good-looking someone is,

567
0:19:17,22 --> 0:19:19,59
how good can they look in their thirties or forties?

568
0:19:19,59 --> 0:19:22,13
So my pursuit back then didn't really mean much.

569
0:19:22,13 --> 0:19:23,39
People who liked me,

570
0:19:23,39 --> 0:19:24,87
I actually knew there were many.

571
0:19:24,87 --> 0:19:27,9
And often, I missed out on them.

572
0:19:27,9 --> 0:19:29,99
But those who liked me usually had one issue.

573
0:19:29,99 --> 0:19:33,86
They sought a stable emotional connection and a spirit of commitment.

574
0:19:33,86 --> 0:19:36,36
But I tend to be someone who enjoys taking risks.

575
0:19:36,36 --> 0:19:37,64
Someone who prefers the unpredictable.

576
0:19:37,64 --> 0:19:41,16
So my greatest sense of achievement comes from winning them over.

577
0:19:41,16 --> 0:19:42,92
a challenging target

578
0:19:42,92 --> 0:19:43,84
so for me

579
0:19:43,84 --> 0:19:46,75
a goal that has already been achieved has no appeal

580
0:19:46,75 --> 0:19:48,79
this is also a common misconception among men

581
0:19:48,79 --> 0:19:49,48
that's how it is

582
0:19:49,48 --> 0:19:51,16
women tend to be more

583
0:19:51,16 --> 0:19:52,36
attracted to the object of their affection

584
0:19:52,36 --> 0:19:55,38
men, once they succeed in achieving something

585
0:19:55,38 --> 0:19:56,32
once they have succeeded

586
0:19:56,32 --> 0:19:58,81
He gradually stops valuing this person.

587
0:19:59,67 --> 0:20:1,3
The relationship becomes increasingly distant.

588
0:20:1,3 --> 0:20:4,31
I always complain about not having a stable and fulfilling sex life.

589
0:20:4,31 --> 0:20:7,35
But if you look at my life from another angle,

590
0:20:7,35 --> 0:20:9,27
with so many different partners,

591
0:20:9,27 --> 0:20:12,73
you'd realize what truly matters is,

592
0:20:12,73 --> 0:20:14,79
after getting these people into my life,

593
0:20:14,79 --> 0:20:16,79
I failed to maintain long-term relationships,

594
0:20:16,79 --> 0:20:19,11
and soon turned them all into ex-girlfriends.

595
0:20:20,11 --> 0:20:22,67
So, if someone has a stable relationship,

596
0:20:22,67 --> 0:20:24,699
does that mean they definitely have a stable sex life?

597
0:20:24,699 --> 0:20:26,499
When long-term cohabiting partners are together,

598
0:20:26,499 --> 0:20:27,979
or long-term married couples,

599
0:20:27,979 --> 0:20:29,359
some people really do,

600
0:20:29,359 --> 0:20:29,939
Well,

601
0:20:29,939 --> 0:20:30,739
there are those who can't get enough,

602
0:20:30,739 --> 0:20:31,99
the bold ones,

603
0:20:31,99 --> 0:20:31,739
and those who are too timid to even try.

604
0:20:31,739 --> 0:20:33,26
And some people, indeed.

605
0:20:33,26 --> 0:20:34,5
Complete asexual marriage.

606
0:20:34,5 --> 0:20:36,42
While others are all about fulfilling their duties daily.

607
0:20:36,42 --> 0:20:37,2
Exhausted to the bone.

608
0:20:37,2 --> 0:20:38,8
So no matter what.

609
0:20:38,8 --> 0:20:39,34
When it comes to that point.

610
0:20:39,34 --> 0:20:41,0
It's always a matter of supply and demand imbalance.

611
0:20:41,0 --> 0:20:43,48
Our desires in life are endless.

612
0:20:43,48 --> 0:20:46,32
So I later realized, was what I needed to release actually desire?

613
0:20:46,32 --> 0:20:49,4
Or is it the feeling of outsmarting others that I'm after?

614
0:20:49,4 --> 0:20:50,6
The sense of conquering others?

615
0:20:50,6 --> 0:20:52,26
What am I really pursuing?

616
0:20:52,26 --> 0:20:53,74
What is desire itself?

617
0:20:53,74 --> 0:20:56,47
Isn't desire just a factor produced by my body?

618
0:20:56,47 --> 0:20:59,91
Should I spend more money on these things just because of it?

619
0:20:59,91 --> 0:21:2,219
Should I invest more time and energy?

620
0:21:2,219 --> 0:21:3,419
Generally speaking,

621
0:21:3,419 --> 0:21:6,219
If you spend a lot of time on romantic relationships

622
0:21:6,219 --> 0:21:7,459
Flowers are above.

623
0:21:7,459 --> 0:21:9,49
When it comes to pursuing love,

624
0:21:9,49 --> 0:21:13,49
you will lose most of the crucial times for focusing on your career.

625
0:21:13,49 --> 0:21:14,67
So, no matter what,

626
0:21:14,67 --> 0:21:16,29
if you encounter love,

627
0:21:16,29 --> 0:21:17,33
go with the flow,

628
0:21:17,33 --> 0:21:18,45
it’s all good,

629
0:21:18,45 --> 0:21:19,5
no matter what,

630
0:21:19,5 --> 0:21:19,97
at that time, you might want to get married.

631
0:21:19,97 --> 0:21:20,89
You'll naturally get married.

632
0:21:20,89 --> 0:21:22,28
If you want to have children, you'll naturally have them.

633
0:21:22,28 --> 0:21:23,94
It's okay if you don't find love.

634
0:21:23,94 --> 0:21:24,88
But no matter what happens,

635
0:21:24,88 --> 0:21:28,589
the quality of your love life is determined by your values,

636
0:21:28,589 --> 0:21:29,629
your values,

637
0:21:29,629 --> 0:21:30,509
your values,

638
0:21:30,509 --> 0:21:31,83
whether you have money or not,

639
0:21:31,83 --> 0:21:33,97
you'll still be who you are.

640
0:21:33,97 --> 0:21:35,17
You are a stable person.

641
0:21:35,17 --> 0:21:36,87
You will eventually seek a stable life.

642
0:21:36,87 --> 0:21:37,91
You are not a stable person.

643
0:21:37,91 --> 0:21:40,7
Ultimately, this kind of relationship tends to be short-lived.

644
0:21:40,7 --> 0:21:42,37
So, this is a very normal thing.

645
0:21:42,37 --> 0:21:46,25
I once really wanted to transform myself into a Chang Ze state.

646
0:21:46,25 --> 0:21:48,3
In the end, the marriage ultimately failed.

647
0:21:48,3 --> 0:21:49,74
My girlfriend of two years,

648
0:21:49,74 --> 0:21:51,31
eventually fell for someone else.

649
0:21:51,31 --> 0:21:54,87
So when I myself am in a fleeting state, like a transient person

650
0:21:54,87 --> 0:21:56,49
I am someone who plays the game of life

651
0:21:56,49 --> 0:21:58,889
I naturally adapted to this kind of lifestyle

652
0:21:58,889 --> 0:22:2,649
I insisted on turning myself into a love-struck individual

653
0:22:2,649 --> 0:22:4,849
a family man with strong family values

654
0:22:4,849 --> 0:22:7,25
This is a fixed pattern that is bound to fail

655
0:22:7,25 --> 0:22:9,19
So recognizing oneself is crucial

656
0:22:9,19 --> 0:22:10,97
If you are Masami Nagasawa, you are who you are

657
0:22:10,97 --> 0:22:11,87
You are Masami Nagasawa

658
0:22:11,87 --> 0:22:12,25
Right?

659
0:22:12,25 --> 0:22:14,41
You're the kind of person who likes short things, right?

660
0:22:14,41 --> 0:22:15,25
You, Seiji Ozawa.

661
0:22:15,25 --> 0:22:16,29
No matter what, though,

662
0:22:16,29 --> 0:22:19,83
you should understand that there isn't much difference between long and short.

663
0:22:19,83 --> 0:22:21,9
It mainly comes down to your values.

664
0:22:21,9 --> 0:22:23,52
Your outlook on life, where your core beliefs stand.

665
0:22:23,52 --> 0:22:24,2
Of course,

666
0:22:24,2 --> 0:22:27,31
I believe my core beliefs have had a significant impact on me.

667
0:22:27,31 --> 0:22:30,27
For instance, at every pivotal moment in my life

668
0:22:30,27 --> 0:22:33,15
it's often been due to the opposite sex

669
0:22:33,15 --> 0:22:34,43
regardless of whether they are older

670
0:22:34,43 --> 0:22:35,1
or younger

671
0:22:35,1 --> 0:22:36,15
their support has been instrumental

672
0:22:36,15 --> 0:22:37,83
leading to changes in my worldview

673
0:22:37,83 --> 0:22:39,3
and even where I live

674
0:22:39,3 --> 0:22:40,75
these changes are usually sparked by someone of the opposite sex

675
0:22:40,75 --> 0:22:43,5
so this has been a positive thing

676
0:22:43,5 --> 0:22:45,45
So, maintain a polyamorous relationship

677
0:22:45,45 --> 0:22:48,3
or a balanced dating status

678
0:22:48,3 --> 0:22:50,49
to ensure you are in an open relationship

679
0:22:50,49 --> 0:22:51,9
in this regard

680
0:22:51,9 --> 0:22:52,699
which is beneficial for your career

681
0:22:52,699 --> 0:22:54,259
entrepreneurs do this as well

682
0:22:54,259 --> 0:22:56,119
of course, many people have a happy family

683
0:22:56,119 --> 0:22:57,619
with a supportive wife

684
0:22:57,619 --> 0:23:0,3
but I find that kind of life really boring

685
0:23:0,3 --> 0:23:1,22
It's really boring.

686
0:23:1,22 --> 0:23:3,94
You wake up every day to the same face.

687
0:23:3,94 --> 0:23:4,98
It can get pretty annoying.

688
0:23:4,98 --> 0:23:8,6
So we believe that if a person wants to take a certain path in life,

689
0:23:8,6 --> 0:23:9,26
then they should take it.

690
0:23:9,26 --> 0:23:10,3
If you want to live a certain way,

691
0:23:10,3 --> 0:23:11,48
then live that way.

692
0:23:11,48 --> 0:23:14,0
Don't fall in love just for the sake of love when you're young,

693
0:23:14,0 --> 0:23:15,8
or worry too much about personal gains and losses.

694
0:23:15,8 --> 0:23:18,52
For a certain way of life

695
0:23:18,52 --> 0:23:20,659
The person you truly love is yourself

696
0:23:20,659 --> 0:23:22,219
In the end, you are all you have

697
0:23:22,219 --> 0:23:24,179
Love for yourself is a constant

698
0:23:24,179 --> 0:23:25,419
The ideal you pursue

699
0:23:25,419 --> 0:23:26,19
Is merely

700
0:23:26,19 --> 0:23:28,98
An idealized and self-deceptive version of yourself

701
0:23:28,98 --> 0:23:31,74
Their actual lives might not be worthy of your admiration at all

702
0:23:31,74 --> 0:23:34,52
They might have nothing to do with you

703
0:23:34,52 --> 0:23:35,94
So you need to understand this point

704
0:23:35,94 --> 0:23:37,28
Break free from the ego in love

705
0:23:37,28 --> 0:23:40,31
Break free from those illusory realities

706
0:23:40,31 --> 0:23:42,15
And you will gain something genuine

707
0:23:42,15 --> 0:23:43,3
You will realize

708
0:23:43,3 --> 0:23:44,31
If you're not doing well

709
0:23:44,31 --> 0:23:45,61
Your love life won't be great either

710
0:23:45,61 --> 0:23:46,76
If you're doing well

711
0:23:46,76 --> 0:23:49,3
You can have as much of this as you want

712
0:23:49,3 --> 0:23:53,17
Sexual resources increase with your power and wealth

713
0:23:53,17 --> 0:23:54,27
It's different

714
0:23:54,27 --> 0:23:57,3
When you reach a certain level of capability

715
0:23:57,3 --> 0:23:58,61
You can have as much as you desire

716
0:23:58,61 --> 0:24:0,27
Do you want to invest a lot of money

717
0:24:0,27 --> 0:24:1,3
A lot of time

718
0:24:1,3 --> 0:24:2,679
A lot of energy in this?

719
0:24:2,679 --> 0:24:4,199
My choice is not to

720
0:24:4,199 --> 0:24:4,899
Everyone

721
0:24:4,899 --> 0:24:7,399
But if I wanted to invest a lot of money here

722
0:24:7,399 --> 0:24:7,879
To talk about it

723
0:24:7,879 --> 0:24:9,1
For me

724
0:24:9,1 --> 0:24:10,77
Finding four or five is not a problem

725
0:24:10,77 --> 0:24:13,17
I'm talking about young ones

726
0:24:13,17 --> 0:24:15,1
This is how it is

727
0:24:15,1 --> 0:24:16,19
So no matter what

728
0:24:16,19 --> 0:24:18,77
Men should focus on their careers

729
0:24:18,77 --> 0:24:22,97
Women should use their youthful beauty

730
0:24:22,97 --> 0:24:24,63
To quickly earn their first pot of gold

731
0:24:24,63 --> 0:24:26,77
This is the general value I uphold

732
0:24:26,77 --> 0:24:29,54
Of course, the premise is that you want to create a career

733
0:24:29,54 --> 0:24:31,26
If you just want a normal life

734
0:24:31,26 --> 0:24:32,5
Paying off the mortgage

735
0:24:32,5 --> 0:24:33,5
A nine-to-five lifestyle

736
0:24:33,5 --> 0:24:35,3
Then this should be your pursuit

737
0:24:35,3 --> 0:24:36,62
You should aim for a stable life

738
0:24:36,62 --> 0:24:40,799
If your goal is to make a name in business

739
0:24:40,799 --> 0:24:43,319
Or to live a free life as an individual

740
0:24:43,319 --> 0:24:46,159
Or to live like a writer or artist

741
0:24:46,159 --> 0:24:47,49
Then

742
0:24:47,49 --> 0:24:50,13
A polygamous life might lead to loneliness in old age

743
0:24:50,13 --> 0:24:50,97
It's a kind of punishment

744
0:24:50,97 --> 0:24:51,87
But no matter what

745
0:24:51,87 --> 0:24:53,41
These interactions with the opposite sex

746
0:24:53,41 --> 0:24:55,75
Can bring you significant advantages in resources

747
0:24:55,75 --> 0:24:56,74
That is to say

748
0:24:56,74 --> 0:24:58,68
Whether you're a male or female content creator

749
0:24:58,68 --> 0:25:0,46
Whether you're a male or female influencer

750
0:25:0,46 --> 0:25:1,12
Believe me

751
0:25:1,12 --> 0:25:3,12
You will never truly find love

752
0:25:3,12 --> 0:25:5,9
Even if you do, it's a fleeting illusion

753
0:25:5,9 --> 0:25:6,13
It will eventually end

754
0:25:6,13 --> 0:25:6,89
So

755
0:25:6,89 --> 0:25:9,41
Many celebrity marriages ultimately fail

756
0:25:9,41 --> 0:25:12,61
Because marriage is about mutual support and protection

757
0:25:12,61 --> 0:25:15,14
A kind of mutual safeguarding

758
0:25:15,14 --> 0:25:16,36
Once you have money

759
0:25:16,36 --> 0:25:17,66
You don't need this kind of protection

760
0:25:17,66 --> 0:25:19,76
You don't need to care about these societal norms

761
0:25:19,76 --> 0:25:22,239
Or legal and social contract agreements

762
0:25:22,239 --> 0:25:23,899
Because you are strong enough on your own

763
0:25:23,899 --> 0:25:25,699
At that point, others can only depend on you

764
0:25:25,699 --> 0:25:27,44
So as you've shown

765
0:25:27,44 --> 0:25:29,52
Live to the fullest

766
0:25:29,52 --> 0:25:31,72
And then consider what kind of partner you should look for

767
0:25:31,72 --> 0:25:33,16
Not based on family or social status

768
0:25:33,16 --> 0:25:35,639
But adapt to the image of a partner

769
0:25:35,639 --> 0:25:37,559
When others suggest matchmaking

770
0:25:37,559 --> 0:25:39,26
When others suggest dating

771
0:25:39,26 --> 0:25:40,8
A true man never worries about finding a wife

772
0:25:40,8 --> 0:25:42,22
If you understand this principle

773
0:25:42,22 --> 0:25:44,1
You will live a very carefree life
