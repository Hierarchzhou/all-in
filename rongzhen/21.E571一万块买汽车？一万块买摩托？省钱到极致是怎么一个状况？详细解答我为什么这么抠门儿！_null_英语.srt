1
0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:1,62
Hello everyone, children!

2
0:0:1,62 --> 0:0:3,52
You've probably never seen this view before, right?

3
0:0:3,52 --> 0:0:5,55
This is the perspective I face when looking at my computer screen.

4
0:0:5,55 --> 0:0:8,51
I'm using the faint light from the computer screen to illuminate a bit.

5
0:0:8,51 --> 0:0:13,48
It's 12:29 AM on August 12th.

6
0:0:13,48 --> 0:0:15,66
I haven't updated in the past few days.

7
0:0:15,66 --> 0:0:17,36
A lot has happened recently.

8
0:0:17,36 --> 0:0:20,32
So, I'm starting to update today.

9
0:0:20,32 --> 0:0:21,46
What exactly has happened?

10
0:0:21,46 --> 0:0:24,44
Actually, I recently bought a motorcycle.

11
0:0:24,44 --> 0:0:27,18
And then I also purchased a car.

12
0:0:27,18 --> 0:0:30,259
These two events happened within a week.

13
0:0:30,259 --> 0:0:33,259
I spent about 10,000 yuan on the motorcycle.

14
0:0:33,259 --> 0:0:36,339
And I spent roughly the same amount on the car.

15
0:0:36,339 --> 0:0:37,59
I'll explain the details in the video.

16
0:0:37,59 --> 0:0:39,22
I'll tell you all about it in the video.

17
0:0:39,22 --> 0:0:41,94
The updates were quite slow a couple of days ago.

18
0:0:41,94 --> 0:0:42,94
But I've been taking care of the kids these past two days.

19
0:0:42,94 --> 0:0:44,26
Then the car thing

20
0:0:44,26 --> 0:0:46,76
The motorcycle thing took quite a while to sort out

21
0:0:46,76 --> 0:0:50,62
Then my car was bought from the second-hand car selling website, Guazi

22
0:0:50,62 --> 0:0:52,16
I originally planned to buy from Zhuanzhuan

23
0:0:52,16 --> 0:0:54,36
But I ended up buying from Guazi

24
0:0:54,36 --> 0:0:55,76
It was pretty good, though

25
0:0:55,76 --> 0:0:57,56
Not advertising for any platform

26
0:0:57,56 --> 0:1:1,389
Just saying, both Zhuanzhuan and Guazi are fine options

27
0:1:1,389 --> 0:1:2,809
The car inspection was great

28
0:1:2,809 --> 0:1:4,249
They are all pretty good platforms.

29
0:1:4,249 --> 0:1:6,67
And there's really no favoring one over the other.

30
0:1:6,67 --> 0:1:8,83
The cars I looked at before were all new.

31
0:1:8,83 --> 0:1:11,19
I checked them out on Dongchedi and Autohome.

32
0:1:11,19 --> 0:1:14,64
Oh, each one introduces their products as if they're not advertising at all.

33
0:1:14,64 --> 0:1:16,4
I'm not an automotive UPloader myself.

34
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:18,56
But I do know a few automotive UPloaders.

35
0:1:18,56 --> 0:1:19,52
When I talked to them,

36
0:1:19,52 --> 0:1:20,44
about the car I bought later on.

37
0:1:20,44 --> 0:1:21,28
They all ignore me now.

38
0:1:21,28 --> 0:1:23,88
Hehe, maybe because they think the car I bought is too shabby.

39
0:1:23,88 --> 0:1:25,18
It’s indeed quite so.

40
0:1:25,18 --> 0:1:28,64
It’s not really cheap, just 10,000 yuan.

41
0:1:28,64 --> 0:1:31,8
But the total price is 34,600 yuan.

42
0:1:31,8 --> 0:1:33,72
If you were to buy a new one, though,

43
0:1:33,72 --> 0:1:35,4
it would cost around 40,000 yuan.

44
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:37,96
But generally, dealers offer discounts.

45
0:1:37,96 --> 0:1:40,1
But it's over 40,000 though

46
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:41,15
The reason it's around 30,000

47
0:1:41,15 --> 0:1:42,55
is because if you depreciate it further

48
0:1:42,55 --> 0:1:43,86
and factor in the depreciation of the car

49
0:1:43,86 --> 0:1:45,3
it can still be worth 20,000

50
0:1:45,3 --> 0:1:46,38
So in essence, for this car

51
0:1:46,38 --> 0:1:49,22
I actually only spent about 15,000

52
0:1:49,22 --> 0:1:52,73
Of course, you have to account for various expenses like insurance and so on

53
0:1:52,73 --> 0:1:55,33
So the final cost will definitely exceed this figure

54
0:1:55,33 --> 0:1:57,45
But it’s still quite affordable.

55
0:1:57,45 --> 0:1:58,74
A very reasonable price.

56
0:1:58,74 --> 0:2:0,46
I initially planned to buy one for around 5,000 yuan.

57
0:2:0,46 --> 0:2:4,82
A 6,000 yuan replica of the Suzuki UY125.

58
0:2:4,82 --> 0:2:7,68
But in the end, I went for the genuine Suzuki 125.

59
0:2:7,68 --> 0:2:9,8
I got it from a dealership.

60
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:13,28
The dealership, you see, can handle everything for you, and as you know, I live in one of the six central districts of Beijing.

61
0:2:13,28 --> 0:2:16,8
A household registration in the six central districts of Beijing can only be registered under a company.

62
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:16,64
Did you know that?

63
0:2:16,64 --> 0:2:20,15
My company is located in this suburb.

64
0:2:20,15 --> 0:2:22,97
But the reason I moved it to the suburb was to facilitate supply deliveries.

65
0:2:22,97 --> 0:2:26,73
I specifically registered the company in the suburb for the motorcycle.

66
0:2:26,73 --> 0:2:29,9
Of course, I've had my motorcycle license for three years now.

67
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:30,49
And I've had my car license for five years.

68
0:2:30,49 --> 0:2:32,29
So why did I suddenly change my mind recently?

69
0:2:32,29 --> 0:2:33,69
Actually, the car I got is from a recent event.

70
0:2:33,69 --> 0:2:35,94
It was on May 28th of this year.

71
0:2:35,94 --> 0:2:37,18
I was in the family waiting list.

72
0:2:37,18 --> 0:2:39,96
Then there's the family's new energy vehicle.

73
0:2:39,96 --> 0:2:41,1
Compared to the gasoline car,

74
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:43,46
the chance of getting a gasoline car is quite low.

75
0:2:43,46 --> 0:2:44,75
As a family in Beijing,

76
0:2:44,75 --> 0:2:47,73
but we managed to get a spot for a new energy vehicle through the waiting list.

77
0:2:47,73 --> 0:2:49,31
Beijing's new regulations for 2025

78
0:2:49,31 --> 0:2:53,98
stipulate that only pure electric vehicles qualify as new energy vehicles.

79
0:2:53,98 --> 0:2:55,35
We previously considered a range extender,

80
0:2:55,35 --> 0:2:56,63
and were also thinking about a hybrid.

81
0:2:56,63 --> 0:2:57,39
This won't work.

82
0:2:57,39 --> 0:2:58,55
So there's no way out.

83
0:2:58,55 --> 0:3:0,65
We can only say goodbye to BYD Qin L.

84
0:3:0,65 --> 0:3:3,7
And say goodbye to DDM and the like.

85
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:3,9
There's nothing we can do.

86
0:3:3,9 --> 0:3:7,6
Actually, I was really considering a range-extended model.

87
0:3:7,6 --> 0:3:8,81
One that has a bit of battery capacity.

88
0:3:8,81 --> 0:3:10,49
So it can run on pure electric or gas.

89
0:3:10,49 --> 0:3:13,9
That way, the combination of electric and gas would significantly increase the range, right?

90
0:3:13,9 --> 0:3:16,1
What really matters to me when buying a car is the range.

91
0:3:16,1 --> 0:3:18,79
Like, when can I refuel again?

92
0:3:18,79 --> 0:3:20,25
I recently got this UI model,

93
0:3:20,25 --> 0:3:21,9
after the 125cc version,

94
0:3:21,9 --> 0:3:22,37
this is a motorcycle shop.

95
0:3:22,37 --> 0:3:24,41
after they helped me take care of all these things,

96
0:3:24,41 --> 0:3:28,51
it’s roughly added a secondary fuel tank.

97
0:3:28,51 --> 0:3:30,99
The main fuel tank is 6 liters.

98
0:3:30,99 --> 0:3:33,79
The secondary tank is 10 liters.

99
0:3:33,359 --> 0:3:36,94
On a full tank, it can run 700 kilometers.

100
0:3:36,94 --> 0:3:38,64
That's an impressive range.

101
0:3:38,64 --> 0:3:42,4
So, the Geely Panda Knight I bought now,

102
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:45,329
the original owner had only driven it 6 kilometers,

103
0:3:45,329 --> 0:3:46,649
basically like new, 0 kilometers.

104
0:3:46,649 --> 0:3:48,49
The second-hand car is in excellent condition.

105
0:3:48,49 --> 0:3:49,53
It was first used by a female owner.

106
0:3:49,53 --> 0:3:52,67
So, I'm not particularly concerned about the range.

107
0:3:52,67 --> 0:3:55,11
As everyone knows, my electric car has a range of 100 kilometers.

108
0:3:55,11 --> 0:3:57,519
My electric bike still uses a lead-acid battery, not a lithium one.

109
0:3:57,519 --> 0:4:0,299
My No. 9 mz mix is a lead-acid battery model, after all.

110
0:4:0,299 --> 0:4:2,76
And I don’t plan to switch to lithium batteries in the future.

111
0:4:2,76 --> 0:4:3,92
I just prefer the lead-acid batteries.

112
0:4:3,92 --> 0:4:5,2
Anyway, I replace them every one or two years.

113
0:4:5,2 --> 0:4:7,8
Then it costs about 1,000 yuan after depreciation, right?

114
0:4:7,8 --> 0:4:10,83
Even with the depreciation cost, replacing it would still be around 1,000 yuan.

115
0:4:10,83 --> 0:4:11,63
So, to sum up,

116
0:4:11,63 --> 0:4:13,67
you should buy a large single-cell battery.

117
0:4:13,67 --> 0:4:15,92
Spending four or five thousand might not be necessary.

118
0:4:15,92 --> 0:4:17,76
Besides, buying a large unit also carries the risk of fire.

119
0:4:17,76 --> 0:4:19,12
There's also the risk of losing control.

120
0:4:19,12 --> 0:4:21,66
Moreover, the charging time would be quite long.

121
0:4:21,66 --> 0:4:23,76
So, I decided to go with a battery instead.

122
0:4:23,76 --> 0:4:25,96
Why does my car only have a 200-mile range?

123
0:4:25,96 --> 0:4:28,4
Because I don't plan on getting on the highway.

124
0:4:28,4 --> 0:4:31,62
Because my actual driving experience is practically zero.

125
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:33,86
My motorcycle riding experience is also practically zero.

126
0:4:33,86 --> 0:4:35,5
So I still consider myself

127
0:4:35,5 --> 0:4:37,68
a trainee in this field

128
0:4:37,68 --> 0:4:39,92
and no matter what

129
0:4:39,92 --> 0:4:40,68
it's just a bit

130
0:4:40,68 --> 0:4:44,72
of that experience from riding off-road motorcycles when I was young

131
0:4:44,72 --> 0:4:48,9
plus the experience with electric scooters

132
0:4:48,9 --> 0:4:49,85
so it's not enough to

133
0:4:49,85 --> 0:4:50,93
shake things up

134
0:4:50,93 --> 0:4:53,6
because back then, we were all pretty timid

135
0:4:53,6 --> 0:4:55,56
I haven’t driven much on this motor vehicle lane.

136
0:4:55,56 --> 0:4:57,0
Just driving around for fun.

137
0:4:57,0 --> 0:4:58,22
It’s borrowed from a friend.

138
0:4:58,22 --> 0:5:2,39
So, this bit of experience can’t really count as actual driving experience.

139
0:5:2,39 --> 0:5:6,5
But I think it’s pretty good.

140
0:5:6,5 --> 0:5:7,25
Why did you buy one with such low range?

141
0:5:7,25 --> 0:5:9,9
Because it’s basically sufficient for use within Beijing.

142
0:5:9,9 --> 0:5:12,839
And this Panda Knight can be charged slowly, unlike the Wuling Hongguang.

143
0:5:12,839 --> 0:5:14,359
It can also be charged slowly.

144
0:5:14,359 --> 0:5:15,239
It also supports fast charging

145
0:5:15,239 --> 0:5:18,689
It can charge up to 100% in just 0.51 hours

146
0:5:18,689 --> 0:5:22,419
So in Beijing, it’s hard to get around

147
0:5:22,419 --> 0:5:24,759
But it doesn’t really matter

148
0:5:24,759 --> 0:5:26,959
When it comes to highways

149
0:5:26,959 --> 0:5:29,66
My 125cc motorcycle can go on the highway

150
0:5:29,66 --> 0:5:32,67
But I can’t handle such high speeds

151
0:5:32,67 --> 0:5:33,69
Cars can also go on the highway

152
0:5:33,69 --> 0:5:34,65
But the range is quite short

153
0:5:34,65 --> 0:5:36,13
I'm afraid of breaking down on the highway

154
0:5:36,13 --> 0:5:37,57
So I set a rule for my brother

155
0:5:37,57 --> 0:5:38,6
which is to avoid highways

156
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:40,2
Of course, national roads can be just as dangerous

157
0:5:40,2 --> 0:5:41,96
But I don’t go on long motorcycle trips anymore

158
0:5:41,96 --> 0:5:42,4
Right?

159
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:43,68
If I really go on a motorcycle trip

160
0:5:43,68 --> 0:5:45,78
I’ll send the bike by logistics first

161
0:5:45,78 --> 0:5:48,34
And if I’m going to places like Tibet or Xinjiang

162
0:5:48,34 --> 0:5:49,44
I'm pretty sure

163
0:5:49,44 --> 0:5:50,74
If I really want to go on a road trip

164
0:5:50,74 --> 0:5:52,82
I would rent an off-road vehicle there

165
0:5:52,82 --> 0:5:54,909
Of course, I don't have any off-road driving experience

166
0:5:54,909 --> 0:5:56,109
But I can go with others

167
0:5:56,109 --> 0:5:57,929
And life doesn't necessarily have to be about motorcycle travel

168
0:5:57,929 --> 0:5:58,529
Right?

169
0:5:58,529 --> 0:6:0,909
So buying a motorcycle for me is about fulfilling a wish

170
0:6:0,909 --> 0:6:3,86
Since I've already got my license anyway

171
0:6:3,86 --> 0:6:4,49
Right?

172
0:6:4,49 --> 0:6:6,53
You should have your own motorcycle at some point.

173
0:6:6,53 --> 0:6:6,89
Isn't it?

174
0:6:6,89 --> 0:6:8,93
Otherwise, you'd always be borrowing others' official vehicles.

175
0:6:8,93 --> 0:6:10,7
That's not very meaningful, is it?

176
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:12,13
Back then, I borrowed from friends to make videos.

177
0:6:12,13 --> 0:6:14,45
Yeah, just borrowed from friends.

178
0:6:14,45 --> 0:6:15,57
It doesn't really make sense.

179
0:6:15,57 --> 0:6:16,29
So, speaking of it,

180
0:6:16,29 --> 0:6:17,93
I actually haven't made any videos about motorcycles.

181
0:6:17,93 --> 0:6:20,96
I think it's really dangerous to ride a motorcycle while filming.

182
0:6:20,96 --> 0:6:23,4
A lot of bikers have died this way.

183
0:6:23,4 --> 0:6:26,87
You know, most of the bloggers in the motorcycle section.

184
0:6:26,87 --> 0:6:29,13
Well, now maybe only one in ten is left.

185
0:6:29,13 --> 0:6:33,61
So I wonder why I suddenly wanted to buy a motorcycle.

186
0:6:33,61 --> 0:6:36,77
I probably got the idea from watching Ha Nai Pi's motorcycle trips.

187
0:6:36,77 --> 0:6:39,9
He went on a motorcycle journey right after getting his license.

188
0:6:39,9 --> 0:6:40,31
And he bought a street bike.

189
0:6:40,31 --> 0:6:42,7
I just think it's really bold.

190
0:6:42,7 --> 0:6:46,21
And indeed, life should be enjoyed early.

191
0:6:46,21 --> 0:6:49,49
But then, you see me spending my limit of 10,000 yuan on a motorcycle,

192
0:6:49,49 --> 0:6:50,85
10,110 yuan on a car,

193
0:6:50,85 --> 0:6:52,1
which actually cost over 30,000 yuan.

194
0:6:52,1 --> 0:6:54,439
But if you add the insurance,

195
0:6:54,439 --> 0:6:55,779
all the miscellaneous expenses together,

196
0:6:55,779 --> 0:6:57,98
it still doesn't exceed 50,000 yuan, right?

197
0:6:57,98 --> 0:7:1,82
Uh, everyone, don't follow my extreme frugality.

198
0:7:1,82 --> 0:7:4,7
Well, extreme frugality, you know,

199
0:7:4,7 --> 0:7:7,35
doesn't actually lead to a particularly good experience, does it?

200
0:7:7,35 --> 0:7:9,98
Your life experiences won't be as fulfilling.

201
0:7:9,98 --> 0:7:12,5
You all know I used to advise people to save money,

202
0:7:12,5 --> 0:7:13,54
but in the past couple of years,

203
0:7:13,54 --> 0:7:16,21
I've started to advise people not to be so frugal anymore.

204
0:7:16,21 --> 0:7:19,71
Because I think young people should get out more,

205
0:7:19,71 --> 0:7:20,85
go to bars,

206
0:7:20,85 --> 0:7:22,35
attend concerts.

207
0:7:22,35 --> 0:7:23,65
Well, going abroad for travel

208
0:7:23,65 --> 0:7:24,59
buying a nice car

209
0:7:24,59 --> 0:7:26,19
we should enjoy life

210
0:7:26,19 --> 0:7:28,84
after all, earning money isn’t easy

211
0:7:28,84 --> 0:7:30,2
so if you want to spend it, go ahead

212
0:7:30,2 --> 0:7:30,98
it’s no big deal

213
0:7:30,98 --> 0:7:32,94
because my goals are different from yours

214
0:7:32,94 --> 0:7:35,2
my goal is to never work a day in my life

215
0:7:35,2 --> 0:7:37,539
I actually haven’t worked for more than a month

216
0:7:37,539 --> 0:7:40,19
If some of my experiences can be counted as work,

217
0:7:40,19 --> 0:7:40,699
then that’s fine.

218
0:7:40,699 --> 0:7:43,139
Because during the time I was actually getting paid,

219
0:7:43,139 --> 0:7:44,99
I wasn’t sitting in the office every day,

220
0:7:44,99 --> 0:7:45,12
nor was it a 996 schedule.

221
0:7:45,12 --> 0:7:48,1
So most of the time, I was basically working in a relaxed state.

222
0:7:48,1 --> 0:7:51,81
So I can’t really say I’ve truly been part of the workforce.

223
0:7:51,81 --> 0:7:52,35
Right?

224
0:7:52,35 --> 0:7:55,45
So, to put it simply, everything has its own place.

225
0:7:55,45 --> 0:7:58,87
So I've decided that I never want to work for the rest of my life.

226
0:7:58,87 --> 0:8:0,51
And it's not just me; I don't want to work for the rest of my life.

227
0:8:0,51 --> 0:8:2,5
I think about my son,

228
0:8:2,5 --> 0:8:3,35
my children.

229
0:8:3,35 --> 0:8:5,61
In the future, there might be more,

230
0:8:5,61 --> 0:8:8,29
but I feel one son is enough for me.

231
0:8:8,29 --> 0:8:10,21
I just hope that my child,

232
0:8:10,21 --> 0:8:12,57
can also have a life without ever having to work.

233
0:8:12,57 --> 0:8:15,17
So I pay special attention to saving money.

234
0:8:15,17 --> 0:8:16,19
Really cares about saving money

235
0:8:16,19 --> 0:8:18,19
Really cares about not spending too much

236
0:8:18,19 --> 0:8:20,75
If some things can get by with the bare minimum

237
0:8:20,75 --> 0:8:22,9
Then just get by with the bare minimum

238
0:8:22,9 --> 0:8:24,18
Now I've got the family quota

239
0:8:24,18 --> 0:8:25,86
If I don't buy a car within a year

240
0:8:25,86 --> 0:8:27,5
They will definitely take the quota back

241
0:8:27,5 --> 0:8:30,45
So I had to buy a used car

242
0:8:30,45 --> 0:8:31,69
As you know, I don't commute either

243
0:8:31,69 --> 0:8:32,81
I don’t go to work

244
0:8:32,81 --> 0:8:33,67
and I don’t drop off my kids

245
0:8:33,67 --> 0:8:34,17
right?

246
0:8:34,17 --> 0:8:35,18
So, when it comes to it

247
0:8:35,18 --> 0:8:36,86
I have absolutely no need for that

248
0:8:36,86 --> 0:8:38,2
Since I don’t have that need

249
0:8:38,2 --> 0:8:39,28
why would I buy a fancy car?

250
0:8:39,28 --> 0:8:42,32
Whether I buy the Xiaomi 12 Ultra or the Xiaomi 12 7

251
0:8:42,32 --> 0:8:44,52
or even the BYD Dolphin

252
0:8:44,52 --> 0:8:45,74
The Seal and Seagull series

253
0:8:45,74 --> 0:8:46,62
I’ve actually seen them all

254
0:8:46,62 --> 0:8:48,62
I really want to buy the Seal

255
0:8:48,62 --> 0:8:50,5
Not that I don’t want the Dolphin series

256
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:52,6
The top-of-the-line Dolphin costs 120,000

257
0:8:52,6 --> 0:8:54,69
But I’ve already bought a car for 30,000

258
0:8:54,69 --> 0:8:56,109
I realized that what I truly like is money

259
0:8:56,109 --> 0:8:58,49
What I really love is a life without work

260
0:8:58,49 --> 0:8:59,46
So for me, speaking of which

261
0:8:59,46 --> 0:9:0,58
What size house you live in

262
0:9:0,58 --> 0:9:1,34
What kind of car you drive

263
0:9:1,34 --> 0:9:2,94
How beautiful your wife is, it doesn’t matter

264
0:9:2,94 --> 0:9:5,76
Because these things can only make me happy for a moment

265
0:9:5,76 --> 0:9:6,56
It’s very impressive

266
0:9:6,56 --> 0:9:7,6
It indeed is very impressive

267
0:9:7,6 --> 0:9:9,24
But no matter how big my house is

268
0:9:9,24 --> 0:9:11,45
I can’t possibly have people over for parties every day

269
0:9:11,45 --> 0:9:13,31
No matter how beautiful my wife is

270
0:9:13,31 --> 0:9:14,73
I’m actually more concerned

271
0:9:14,73 --> 0:9:15,17
right?

272
0:9:15,17 --> 0:9:19,9
even if I find the best car

273
0:9:19,9 --> 0:9:21,1
my looks are what they are now

274
0:9:21,1 --> 0:9:21,81
I drive a nice car

275
0:9:21,81 --> 0:9:22,85
that would be a waste of the car

276
0:9:22,85 --> 0:9:23,41
right?

277
0:9:23,41 --> 0:9:26,499
so I think just having the experience is enough

278
0:9:26,499 --> 0:9:27,279
the motorcycle is the same

279
0:9:27,279 --> 0:9:29,62
I don't necessarily have to buy a 450cc street bike

280
0:9:29,62 --> 0:9:32,1
or a 750cc sport bike

281
0:9:32,1 --> 0:9:34,6
or a 1000cc BMW

282
0:9:34,6 --> 0:9:36,829
I don’t think I have that kind of luck

283
0:9:36,829 --> 0:9:39,289
Actually, I bought an Ultra

284
0:9:39,289 --> 0:9:42,61
and another BMW with a Beijing A license plate

285
0:9:42,61 --> 0:9:45,45
I don’t really spend much cash right now

286
0:9:45,45 --> 0:9:47,33
But for me

287
0:9:47,33 --> 0:9:50,33
the experience from these things is just a momentary thrill

288
0:9:50,33 --> 0:9:53,45
Isn't that what life's all about, that one moment?

289
0:9:53,45 --> 0:9:53,81
Right?

290
0:9:53,81 --> 0:9:55,19
It's all for that moment.

291
0:9:55,19 --> 0:9:57,49
You spend a long time working for it,

292
0:9:57,49 --> 0:9:58,19
earning money,

293
0:9:58,19 --> 0:10:0,57
paying off loans.

294
0:10:0,57 --> 0:10:1,46
It's really not necessary.

295
0:10:1,46 --> 0:10:2,78
I even did the math before,

296
0:10:2,78 --> 0:10:3,66
whether to go for an installment plan.

297
0:10:3,66 --> 0:10:4,66
I originally planned to go for an installment plan

298
0:10:4,66 --> 0:10:5,9
that way, I could spend a small amount of money

299
0:10:5,9 --> 0:10:7,41
but I found out that with the installment plan

300
0:10:7,41 --> 0:10:10,75
even though it's only 619 dollars a month for five years

301
0:10:10,75 --> 0:10:14,47
you still have to pay 30% upfront

302
0:10:14,47 --> 0:10:15,83
which is 13,000 dollars

303
0:10:15,83 --> 0:10:18,819
and in reality, you end up paying 13,000 dollars in interest

304
0:10:18,819 --> 0:10:20,739
that 13,000 dollars in interest is no small amount

305
0:10:20,739 --> 0:10:21,299
right?

306
0:10:21,299 --> 0:10:23,64
It accumulates to over 2,000 dollars in interest every year for five years.

307
0:10:23,64 --> 0:10:26,5
So I think it doesn’t make much sense.

308
0:10:26,5 --> 0:10:28,12
If you insist on financing it,

309
0:10:28,12 --> 0:10:31,12
I later thought that if you buy a house on installment,

310
0:10:31,12 --> 0:10:32,34
or a car on installment,

311
0:10:32,34 --> 0:10:35,68
like I bought the Xiaomi Ultra,

312
0:10:35,68 --> 0:10:37,1
I put down 150,000 as a down payment,

313
0:10:37,1 --> 0:10:38,56
and the actual money I paid out,

314
0:10:38,56 --> 0:10:41,74
in the end, could be a very large figure.

315
0:10:41,74 --> 0:10:44,62
When it comes to car loans,

316
0:10:44,62 --> 0:10:47,87
it's usually calculated at 18% or some other rate,

317
0:10:47,87 --> 0:10:49,37
the amount you owe on Huabei,

318
0:10:49,37 --> 0:10:50,13
the credit card debt,

319
0:10:50,13 --> 0:10:50,87
the car loan,

320
0:10:50,87 --> 0:10:52,75
the mortgage rate is quite high,

321
0:10:52,75 --> 0:10:55,239
especially the car loan rate is quite high,

322
0:10:55,239 --> 0:10:57,719
but the mortgage rate has come down now,

323
0:10:57,719 --> 0:11:1,96
though you might only be able to afford a house once in your lifetime.

324
0:11:1,96 --> 0:11:3,2
For most people,

325
0:11:3,2 --> 0:11:5,4
you can probably afford to buy a house only once.

326
0:11:5,4 --> 0:11:8,269
You can't realistically buy two or three houses.

327
0:11:8,269 --> 0:11:9,629
If you do buy two or three houses,

328
0:11:9,629 --> 0:11:12,29
it means the housing prices where you bought them are relatively low.

329
0:11:12,29 --> 0:11:15,72
Places with low housing prices don't necessarily guarantee stable prices.

330
0:11:15,72 --> 0:11:16,86
Speaking of now,

331
0:11:16,86 --> 0:11:18,19
major cities lifting purchase restrictions,

332
0:11:18,19 --> 0:11:19,83
it will impact smaller cities.

333
0:11:19,83 --> 0:11:21,13
Small and medium-sized cities and towns

334
0:11:21,13 --> 0:11:24,47
and the money from these counties is all drawn to the big cities

335
0:11:24,47 --> 0:11:26,41
ultimately, you'll find your opportunities

336
0:11:26,41 --> 0:11:28,29
your social mobility

337
0:11:28,29 --> 0:11:29,43
your business endeavors

338
0:11:29,43 --> 0:11:32,339
these talents can only be realized in big cities

339
0:11:32,339 --> 0:11:33,639
in small cities

340
0:11:34,659 --> 0:11:36,859
they have already monopolized the local resources

341
0:11:36,859 --> 0:11:37,919
it's a society based on personal connections

342
0:11:37,919 --> 0:11:39,999
So you're completely impervious to any criticism or advice.

343
0:11:39,999 --> 0:11:42,77
Only independent men and women in big cities

344
0:11:42,77 --> 0:11:44,45
have a certain chance of surviving.

345
0:11:44,45 --> 0:11:48,989
This whole concept of health, elderly care, and consumption-oriented housing

346
0:11:48,989 --> 0:11:49,949
only makes sense in this context.

347
0:11:49,949 --> 0:11:52,72
So ensuring you have a large apartment in a small city

348
0:11:52,72 --> 0:11:53,84
isn’t really that useful.

349
0:11:53,84 --> 0:11:54,96
So in a small city,

350
0:11:54,96 --> 0:11:57,65
having a modest home for personal use is enough.

351
0:11:57,65 --> 0:12:1,17
If you're investing, you should still consider big cities.

352
0:12:1,17 --> 0:12:2,59
It's still advisable to invest in major cities.

353
0:12:2,59 --> 0:12:3,91
That's just my personal opinion, though.

354
0:12:3,91 --> 0:12:5,9
Of course, it's not always accurate.

355
0:12:5,9 --> 0:12:6,46
No worries.

356
0:12:6,46 --> 0:12:8,1
You don't have to follow my advice.

357
0:12:8,1 --> 0:12:11,939
Anyway, this time it's about the Extreme Challenge of buying a car for 10,000 yuan.

358
0:12:11,939 --> 0:12:13,259
Or buying a house for 10,000 yuan.

359
0:12:13,259 --> 0:12:14,33
Not buying a house for 10,000 yuan, though.

360
0:12:14,33 --> 0:12:15,21
Spent ten thousand yuan on a car

361
0:12:15,21 --> 0:12:16,9
Spent ten thousand yuan on a motorcycle

362
0:12:16,9 --> 0:12:17,69
But I managed to pull it off

363
0:12:17,69 --> 0:12:18,39
Pretty happy about it

364
0:12:18,39 --> 0:12:20,52
Actually, I didn't really need to buy the motorcycle

365
0:12:20,52 --> 0:12:21,76
Could have gone for a cheaper one, a few thousand yuan one

366
0:12:21,76 --> 0:12:24,18
But once I learned CED, I just had to get a motorcycle

367
0:12:24,18 --> 0:12:25,38
Couldn't help it

368
0:12:25,38 --> 0:12:28,12
And the joy of motorcycle touring is irreplaceable

369
0:12:28,12 --> 0:12:29,64
The joy of being a biker is something

370
0:12:29,64 --> 0:12:31,3
many people can't even imagine.

371
0:12:31,3 --> 0:12:33,82
Ever since I got this motorcycle,

372
0:12:33,82 --> 0:12:37,3
I now greet people and say,

373
0:12:37,3 --> 0:12:39,81
hey, if you're free, I can take you for a ride on my motorcycle.

374
0:12:39,81 --> 0:12:41,91
Of course, many would say,

375
0:12:41,91 --> 0:12:45,15
if it’s a scooter,

376
0:12:45,15 --> 0:12:46,79
girls would definitely give it a second look,

377
0:12:46,79 --> 0:12:48,35
or maybe even roll their eyes.

378
0:12:48,35 --> 0:12:49,11
I don't care

379
0:12:49,11 --> 0:12:49,55
Is that right?

380
0:12:49,55 --> 0:12:51,11
Why do I have to carry a beautiful woman?

381
0:12:51,11 --> 0:12:53,38
Can't I carry my good friend instead?

382
0:12:53,38 --> 0:12:54,36
That's quite normal

383
0:12:54,36 --> 0:12:59,45
And I think owning a car isn't that significant either

384
0:12:59,45 --> 0:13:0,49
Once you truly own it

385
0:13:0,49 --> 0:13:1,49
You'll find it not very useful

386
0:13:1,49 --> 0:13:2,859
It's more of a burden

387
0:13:2,859 --> 0:13:4,859
I feel like I'm a burden now

388
0:13:4,859 --> 0:13:6,259
I still need to pick up that car

389
0:13:6,259 --> 0:13:7,259
and drive it back

390
0:13:7,259 --> 0:13:8,319
find a place to park it

391
0:13:8,319 --> 0:13:9,19
find a spot to park

392
0:13:9,19 --> 0:13:10,4
and make sure it doesn't get sunburned

393
0:13:10,4 --> 0:13:12,1
I also need to buy some sun protection gear

394
0:13:12,1 --> 0:13:14,52
and after a while, when I go out

395
0:13:14,52 --> 0:13:15,68
I need to turn on the air conditioning first

396
0:13:15,68 --> 0:13:17,82
Then I have to find a parking spot

397
0:13:17,82 --> 0:13:19,42
And pay for parking

398
0:13:19,42 --> 0:13:20,7
Not to mention maintenance

399
0:13:20,7 --> 0:13:21,94
Ugh, it's just so annoying

400
0:13:21,94 --> 0:13:26,27
I just had to park my motorcycle at the designated spot today

401
0:13:26,27 --> 0:13:27,47
This motorcycle repair

402
0:13:27,47 --> 0:13:30,38
Installing a GPS tracker on the motorcycle

403
0:13:30,38 --> 0:13:31,44
Modifying the fuel tank

404
0:13:31,44 --> 0:13:33,5
Upgrading the trunk and adding a guard bar

405
0:13:33,5 --> 0:13:36,2
Then, going to the vehicle management office for registration was quite exhausting.

406
0:13:36,2 --> 0:13:37,569
It really wore me out.

407
0:13:37,569 --> 0:13:38,649
So, to talk about it,

408
0:13:38,649 --> 0:13:41,329
sometimes in life, what's crucial is the experience.

409
0:13:41,329 --> 0:13:43,85
After experiencing it, it turns out to be just that.

410
0:13:43,85 --> 0:13:47,15
So I think learning to ride a motorcycle or drive a car is still useful.

411
0:13:47,15 --> 0:13:49,71
Because in some cities and countries, you can go on motorcycle trips.

412
0:13:49,71 --> 0:13:50,31
For example, Canada.

413
0:13:50,31 --> 0:13:51,359
For example, France.

414
0:13:51,359 --> 0:13:52,959
The two places where I went to school

415
0:13:52,959 --> 0:13:54,279
I can actually do motorcycle touring at both

416
0:13:54,279 --> 0:13:55,22
I'm quite happy about it

417
0:13:55,22 --> 0:13:57,62
Motorcycle touring is different from a road trip

418
0:13:57,62 --> 0:13:59,2
But on a road trip, you can bring food

419
0:13:59,2 --> 0:13:59,38
and toys

420
0:13:59,38 --> 0:14:0,1
and use it as a bed

421
0:14:0,1 --> 0:14:0,84
and go camping

422
0:14:0,84 --> 0:14:1,42
It's really great

423
0:14:1,42 --> 0:14:2,2
When it comes to motorcycle travel,

424
0:14:2,2 --> 0:14:4,5
you'll have to rough it out in the open.

425
0:14:4,5 --> 0:14:4,99
But it's manageable in China,

426
0:14:4,99 --> 0:14:5,89
I think it's different abroad.

427
0:14:5,89 --> 0:14:9,99
If you're roughing it out in urban areas,

428
0:14:9,99 --> 0:14:11,819
you might get attacked by thugs or something like that.

429
0:14:11,819 --> 0:14:13,96
And it's not necessarily safe in the wild either.

430
0:14:13,96 --> 0:14:14,42
You know,

431
0:14:14,42 --> 0:14:15,54
you might even get checked by the police.

432
0:14:15,54 --> 0:14:16,26
Well, you know

433
0:14:16,26 --> 0:14:19,15
unlike our area which has these highway service areas

434
0:14:19,15 --> 0:14:20,71
sometimes they let you

435
0:14:20,71 --> 0:14:23,17
some places even allow you to camp and so on

436
0:14:23,17 --> 0:14:24,71
after all, it's not a socialist country

437
0:14:24,71 --> 0:14:26,67
they don't care as much about the common people

438
0:14:26,67 --> 0:14:27,97
so that's the difference

439
0:14:27,97 --> 0:14:32,35
and I think if you really love buying cars

440
0:14:32,35 --> 0:14:34,51
or really love buying motorcycles

441
0:14:34,51 --> 0:14:36,99
Actually, getting one at a reasonable price would be fine.

442
0:14:36,99 --> 0:14:39,329
Because my ultimate goal is to not work.

443
0:14:39,329 --> 0:14:42,129
Your ultimate goal might be to enjoy life.

444
0:14:42,129 --> 0:14:43,14
Enjoy life.

445
0:14:43,14 --> 0:14:44,44
Spending the money in advance,

446
0:14:44,44 --> 0:14:45,46
you’ll have to work later.

447
0:14:45,46 --> 0:14:46,34
for a long time,

448
0:14:46,34 --> 0:14:47,68
and there’s no guarantee you’ll even have a job.

449
0:14:47,68 --> 0:14:49,68
I choose to explain it this way.

450
0:14:49,68 --> 0:14:50,72
It's my choice

451
0:14:50,72 --> 0:14:52,599
My happiness is limited, though

452
0:14:52,599 --> 0:14:54,519
I applied for a Japanese visa but didn't go

453
0:14:54,519 --> 0:14:55,959
I applied for a Canadian visa but didn't go

454
0:14:55,959 --> 0:14:57,559
I applied for a U.S. visa but didn't go

455
0:14:57,559 --> 0:14:59,2
Just having it is enough

456
0:14:59,2 --> 0:15:1,2
Knowing I can go whenever I want is enough

457
0:15:1,2 --> 0:15:2,6
Other things are unnecessary

458
0:15:2,6 --> 0:15:4,14
So that's how it is

459
0:15:4,14 --> 0:15:5,96
Everyone's sensory experiences are different.

460
0:15:5,96 --> 0:15:8,29
Don't let me dictate how you should live your life.

461
0:15:8,29 --> 0:15:9,17
Of course,

462
0:15:9,17 --> 0:15:9,95
As everyone knows,

463
0:15:9,95 --> 0:15:11,85
Not working is a great source of happiness.

464
0:15:11,85 --> 0:15:14,45
When you're not working, you have a lot of time for creativity.

465
0:15:15,65 --> 0:15:17,49
Well, it's kind of like living off your parents.

466
0:15:17,49 --> 0:15:19,45
Except I'm the one paying my parents.

467
0:15:19,45 --> 0:15:21,9
You guys probably get money from your parents.

468
0:15:21,9 --> 0:15:22,37
It just feels different

469
0:15:22,37 --> 0:15:24,81
But as you all know, my previous advice was that

470
0:15:24,81 --> 0:15:27,46
If your state over the past couple of years hasn't been quite right

471
0:15:27,46 --> 0:15:29,38
You see, the advice I give to young people and those in their thirties

472
0:15:29,38 --> 0:15:30,54
Is different from what I suggest to people in their forties

473
0:15:30,54 --> 0:15:32,6
To the younger crowd, I recommend focusing on further education

474
0:15:32,6 --> 0:15:33,72
Making education your priority

475
0:15:33,72 --> 0:15:34,9
Regardless of the circumstances

476
0:15:34,9 --> 0:15:35,94
Go abroad and broaden your horizons

477
0:15:35,94 --> 0:15:36,6
For those in their thirties

478
0:15:36,6 --> 0:15:38,7
I suggest you try to take it easy

479
0:15:38,7 --> 0:15:40,22
and save up your money

480
0:15:40,22 --> 0:15:42,8
then start a second career

481
0:15:42,8 --> 0:15:42,82
For those in their forties

482
0:15:42,82 --> 0:15:44,22
if you still haven’t made it

483
0:15:44,22 --> 0:15:47,7
I think it’s important to have a clear mind

484
0:15:47,7 --> 0:15:48,11
just live

485
0:15:48,11 --> 0:15:50,11
and make sure you’re happy

486
0:15:50,11 --> 0:15:52,4
Young people can still strive for their goals.

487
0:15:52,4 --> 0:15:53,24
But I still stand by what I said.

488
0:15:53,24 --> 0:15:54,16
I've told everyone this before.

489
0:15:54,16 --> 0:15:58,13
Not in this video, though.

490
0:15:58,13 --> 0:15:59,53
But I mentioned it in other videos.

491
0:15:59,53 --> 0:16:1,97
If you're young and want to break through social barriers,

492
0:16:1,97 --> 0:16:4,24
learning French remains crucial.

493
0:16:4,24 --> 0:16:7,56
I want to remind everyone again in this video to study French diligently.

494
0:16:7,56 --> 0:16:9,23
Study French, indeed.

495
0:16:9,23 --> 0:16:10,55
Let's not even talk about going to France.

496
0:16:10,55 --> 0:16:12,95
You'd be in Quebec right away.

497
0:16:12,95 --> 0:16:14,71
And speaking of the entire country of Canada,

498
0:16:14,71 --> 0:16:16,1
if you're fluent in French,

499
0:16:16,1 --> 0:16:18,7
it will give you a significant advantage.

500
0:16:18,7 --> 0:16:20,1
Since I studied in Canada,

501
0:16:20,1 --> 0:16:21,75
I'm definitely going to highlight the benefits of Canada.

502
0:16:21,75 --> 0:16:23,41
Of course, Canada has its downsides too.

503
0:16:23,41 --> 0:16:25,46
For example, it's not easy to find a job.

504
0:16:25,46 --> 0:16:27,6
But compared to the difficulty of finding it,

505
0:16:27,6 --> 0:16:29,5
there's no age or racial discrimination.

506
0:16:29,5 --> 0:16:31,6
These things just don't exist.

507
0:16:31,6 --> 0:16:32,2
Some people say,

508
0:16:32,2 --> 0:16:34,22
you might forget your last name,

509
0:16:34,22 --> 0:16:36,34
but most companies don’t have these issues.

510
0:16:36,34 --> 0:16:37,78
They all promote fair competition.

511
0:16:37,78 --> 0:16:39,52
After all, I have looked for jobs there before,

512
0:16:39,52 --> 0:16:42,4
so I know what it's like.

513
0:16:42,4 --> 0:16:45,7
It's because I think places like Canada

514
0:16:45,7 --> 0:16:45,83
Australia

515
0:16:45,83 --> 0:16:46,55
and New Zealand

516
0:16:46,55 --> 0:16:48,69
have been changing their immigration policies over the past couple of years

517
0:16:48,69 --> 0:16:51,329
and now everyone knows that Japan has tightened its business management visa requirements

518
0:16:51,329 --> 0:16:53,589
so I often advise young people

519
0:16:53,589 --> 0:16:54,329
especially those in their twenties

520
0:16:54,329 --> 0:16:55,68
whose parents are still young

521
0:16:55,68 --> 0:16:56,68
to consider going abroad

522
0:16:56,68 --> 0:16:57,36
Then choose

523
0:16:57,36 --> 0:16:58,12
Then go early

524
0:16:58,12 --> 0:16:58,44
Well

525
0:16:58,44 --> 0:16:59,32
We people in our forties

526
0:16:59,32 --> 0:17:1,72
Honestly, after we leave, it's a matter of life and death

527
0:17:1,72 --> 0:17:4,41
It's a time when our parents really need us

528
0:17:4,41 --> 0:17:5,13
We're leaving now

529
0:17:5,13 --> 0:17:6,35
That wouldn't be appropriate

530
0:17:6,35 --> 0:17:7,76
So there's a possibility that

531
0:17:7,76 --> 0:17:9,4
For example, after your parents leave

532
0:17:9,4 --> 0:17:9,64
we can leave then

533
0:17:9,64 --> 0:17:11,56
This is a more suitable approach

534
0:17:11,56 --> 0:17:13,7
But how do you know when your parents will leave?

535
0:17:13,7 --> 0:17:14,46
You might be 40

536
0:17:14,46 --> 0:17:15,5
You might be 60

537
0:17:15,5 --> 0:17:17,19
Or even 30, and it could be different

538
0:17:17,19 --> 0:17:19,35
So this situation is about your parents leaving while they are still young

539
0:17:19,35 --> 0:17:21,19
At 30, would you still feel like you’re living a good life?

540
0:17:21,19 --> 0:17:22,23
Not necessarily.

541
0:17:22,23 --> 0:17:25,23
So when people talk about someone who has a shallow connection with their relatives,

542
0:17:25,23 --> 0:17:28,51
it actually means they can start a new life anywhere.

543
0:17:28,51 --> 0:17:31,39
Often, you might say, 'Oh, I don't have these things right now.',

544
0:17:31,39 --> 0:17:32,11
I don't have a car,

545
0:17:32,11 --> 0:17:33,26
I don't have a house,

546
0:17:33,26 --> 0:17:34,5
but you need to realize that without a car,

547
0:17:34,5 --> 0:17:35,22
without a house,

548
0:17:35,22 --> 0:17:38,47
nobody can hold you back.

549
0:17:38,83 --> 0:17:39,91
You don't have children

550
0:17:39,91 --> 0:17:40,59
You're not married

551
0:17:40,59 --> 0:17:42,39
So no one will hold you back

552
0:17:43,71 --> 0:17:45,909
If you want to go abroad, you can leave anytime

553
0:17:45,909 --> 0:17:46,909
Without parents

554
0:17:46,909 --> 0:17:48,29
There's even less restriction on you

555
0:17:48,29 --> 0:17:50,829
Of course, you might say that many people still tell me I'll lose my source of income

556
0:17:50,829 --> 0:17:51,929
That's true

557
0:17:51,929 --> 0:17:54,69
So the more you have

558
0:17:54,69 --> 0:17:55,649
Actually, the more you are restricted

559
0:17:55,649 --> 0:17:56,849
Look, if I go abroad once

560
0:17:56,849 --> 0:17:58,529
I'm worried about what will happen to my son

561
0:17:58,529 --> 0:17:59,669
What if my dad gets sick

562
0:17:59,669 --> 0:18:0,3
Who can I turn to

563
0:18:0,3 --> 0:18:1,64
What if my mom gets sick

564
0:18:1,64 --> 0:18:3,2
There needs to be someone to rely on

565
0:18:3,2 --> 0:18:5,26
Whether it's an older brother, sister, relative, or friend

566
0:18:5,26 --> 0:18:7,8
You need to have someone to entrust your child to

567
0:18:7,8 --> 0:18:7,76
What to do

568
0:18:7,76 --> 0:18:8,18
How to connect

569
0:18:8,18 --> 0:18:9,66
How to return it and such

570
0:18:9,66 --> 0:18:10,88
I need to discuss with my ex-wife

571
0:18:10,88 --> 0:18:11,2
Right?

572
0:18:11,2 --> 0:18:13,1
So the more you have of this

573
0:18:13,1 --> 0:18:15,16
The more you have to consider

574
0:18:15,16 --> 0:18:16,78
You talk about having 3000 beauties in your harem

575
0:18:16,78 --> 0:18:18,9
How do you settle them all?'

576
0:18:18,9 --> 0:18:18,57
Right?

577
0:18:18,57 --> 0:18:19,33
You can't possibly know everyone.

578
0:18:19,33 --> 0:18:20,57
And then be abandoned.

579
0:18:20,57 --> 0:18:20,85
Right?

580
0:18:20,85 --> 0:18:22,13
You have to settle them down.

581
0:18:22,13 --> 0:18:22,75
Right?

582
0:18:22,75 --> 0:18:24,5
Buy them a house.

583
0:18:24,5 --> 0:18:25,35
Take good care of them.

584
0:18:25,35 --> 0:18:25,91
Plump and healthy.

585
0:18:25,91 --> 0:18:26,27
Isn't it?

586
0:18:26,27 --> 0:18:28,91
So the more you have, the more complications there are.

587
0:18:28,91 --> 0:18:31,11
Having cars, houses, yachts, and planes.

588
0:18:31,11 --> 0:18:32,95
How much money do you have to spend on them?

589
0:18:32,95 --> 0:18:33,87
How much effort do you have to put in?

590
0:18:33,87 --> 0:18:35,3
This is a significant burden.

591
0:18:35,3 --> 0:18:37,41
So I suggest that the less you own, the better.

592
0:18:37,41 --> 0:18:38,13
The happier you'll be.

593
0:18:38,13 --> 0:18:39,75
This way, you have fewer ties.

594
0:18:39,75 --> 0:18:42,35
And having more possessions doesn't necessarily mean more happiness.

595
0:18:42,35 --> 0:18:45,53
So when I have to own something, I choose the cheaper option.

596
0:18:45,53 --> 0:18:46,61
Because I think owning a luxury car is really a burden.

597
0:18:46,61 --> 0:18:50,1
And the more outstanding your children are, the more you can't let go of them.

598
0:18:50,1 --> 0:18:52,2
The more distant the relationship becomes.

599
0:18:52,2 --> 0:18:54,0
For example, my relationship with my father isn't good.

600
0:18:54,0 --> 0:18:57,31
My relationship with my mother isn't good either.

601
0:18:57,31 --> 0:18:59,27
I can choose not to see them, and that's actually a blessing.

602
0:18:59,27 --> 0:19:0,31
Always look at the best side of things.

603
0:19:0,31 --> 0:19:1,71
The side that benefits you the most.

604
0:19:1,71 --> 0:19:3,389
Don't dwell on the negative aspects.

605
0:19:3,389 --> 0:19:6,309
This way, you can be very happy.

606
0:19:6,309 --> 0:19:8,69
As I always say,

607
0:19:8,69 --> 0:19:10,389
The more you own, the less happy you might be.

608
0:19:10,389 --> 0:19:12,669
The more you have, the more of a burden it can become.

609
0:19:12,669 --> 0:19:13,469
You may have to invest a lot of time and energy into it.

610
0:19:13,469 --> 0:19:15,389
Without it, you can just walk away.

611
0:19:15,389 --> 0:19:16,189
Like me, I have a cat,

612
0:19:16,189 --> 0:19:17,309
A car,

613
0:19:17,309 --> 0:19:19,75
A motorcycle,

614
0:19:19,75 --> 0:19:20,51
A house,

615
0:19:20,51 --> 0:19:21,63
Parents,

616
0:19:21,63 --> 0:19:23,54
And a son.

617
0:19:23,54 --> 0:19:24,46
Do you think I can go out and play?

618
0:19:24,46 --> 0:19:25,3
And have a good time?

619
0:19:25,3 --> 0:19:26,18
Impossible.

620
0:19:26,18 --> 0:19:26,78
Right?

621
0:19:26,78 --> 0:19:27,38
When the child is far away,

622
0:19:27,38 --> 0:19:28,86
The mother worries.

623
0:19:28,86 --> 0:19:29,7
You have all sorts of concerns in your heart.

624
0:19:29,7 --> 0:19:30,16
So you can't live your life to the fullest.

625
0:19:30,16 --> 0:19:30,76
If you have a distant relationship with your family,

626
0:19:30,76 --> 0:19:31,68
No wife,

627
0:19:31,68 --> 0:19:32,12
No children,

628
0:19:32,12 --> 0:19:34,1
You are a free person.

629
0:19:34,1 --> 0:19:36,35
No house,

630
0:19:36,35 --> 0:19:37,65
No car,

631
0:19:37,65 --> 0:19:38,93
You are a born adventurer.

632
0:19:38,93 --> 0:19:40,29
You can wander anywhere,

633
0:19:40,29 --> 0:19:41,33
And no one will miss you.

634
0:19:41,33 --> 0:19:41,95
That's a pretty good thing.

635
0:19:41,95 --> 0:19:42,75
As they say, I would give up everything I have now to bring my father back to life.

636
0:19:42,75 --> 0:19:44,39
That's a remarkable thing.

637
0:19:44,39 --> 0:19:45,87
I feel that family is the most important thing to me.

638
0:19:45,87 --> 0:19:47,7
Maybe I don't need to go out and play.

639
0:19:47,7 --> 0:19:48,74
So this is how I save money.

640
0:19:48,74 --> 0:19:51,26
So it's like what Lan Zhanfei said.

641
0:19:51,26 --> 0:19:54,86
I’d rather trade everything I have now for my dad to come back to life.

642
0:19:54,86 --> 0:19:56,72
This thing is truly remarkable.

643
0:19:56,72 --> 0:19:58,72
I also feel that family ties are important to me

644
0:19:58,72 --> 0:19:59,94
It might be the heaviest one.

645
0:19:59,94 --> 0:20:1,68
Going out to play might not be necessary.

646
0:20:1,68 --> 0:20:3,74
So this is how I save money.
