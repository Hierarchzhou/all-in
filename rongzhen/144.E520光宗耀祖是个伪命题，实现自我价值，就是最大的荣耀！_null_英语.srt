1
0:0:1,8 --> 0:0:1,88
Hey everyone!

2
0:0:1,88 --> 0:0:3,44
I'm still in Shanghai.

3
0:0:3,44 --> 0:0:5,68
It's the second day of the comic convention now.

4
0:0:5,68 --> 0:0:10,4
After today's events, I'll be heading back home right away.

5
0:0:10,4 --> 0:0:12,76
This is also the last day of the Qingming holiday.

6
0:0:12,76 --> 0:0:15,41
But for this episode, let's talk about

7
0:0:15,41 --> 0:0:19,96
a fundamental aspiration of the Chinese people: to honor and glorify their ancestors.

8
0:0:19,96 --> 0:0:23,12
The idea of honoring and glorifying one's ancestors is quite understandable.

9
0:0:23,12 --> 0:0:25,76
For many years, society has been this way.

10
0:0:25,76 --> 0:0:27,9
The relationship between sovereign and subject, father and son, you know.

11
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:30,189
But let's talk about the idea of bringing glory to one's ancestors; it's actually a false notion.

12
0:0:30,189 --> 0:0:32,42
How should I put it?

13
0:0:32,42 --> 0:0:34,24
You might think your ancestors were very powerful,

14
0:0:34,24 --> 0:0:37,58
but in fact, all of your ancestors had already surrendered during the Qing Dynasty.

15
0:0:37,58 --> 0:0:38,17
Right?

16
0:0:38,17 --> 0:0:40,17
Because those who were stubborn were mostly killed, you see.

17
0:0:40,17 --> 0:0:43,27
So, when you talk about who your ancestors were,

18
0:0:43,27 --> 0:0:44,91
it's actually not that important.

19
0:0:44,91 --> 0:0:48,59
You just want to say who the most impressive person in your ancestry is.

20
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:49,71
Someone as remarkable as you.

21
0:0:49,71 --> 0:0:50,97
That's what you want to say.

22
0:0:50,97 --> 0:0:52,83
But in reality, who your ancestors really are

23
0:0:52,83 --> 0:0:54,5
you don't really care about.

24
0:0:54,5 --> 0:0:55,33
So who was your great-grandfather?

25
0:0:55,33 --> 0:0:56,7
What was his name?

26
0:0:56,7 --> 0:0:57,5
What did he do in his life?

27
0:0:57,5 --> 0:0:58,32
You have no idea at all.

28
0:0:58,32 --> 0:1:0,54
So we say that creating a family tree is a task worth dedicating a night to.

29
0:1:0,54 --> 0:1:2,72
This is what truly deserves our pursuit.

30
0:1:2,72 --> 0:1:4,64
It means you admire your ancestors.

31
0:1:4,64 --> 0:1:5,36
But it’s not very practical.

32
0:1:5,36 --> 0:1:6,6
What we call glorifying the family name,

33
0:1:6,6 --> 0:1:8,16
is essentially about saving face,

34
0:1:8,16 --> 0:1:9,56
but it’s not really that useful either.

35
0:1:9,56 --> 0:1:13,16
The most important happiness in life is making yourself feel good.

36
0:1:13,16 --> 0:1:14,12
It’s all about making yourself happy.

37
0:1:14,12 --> 0:1:15,6
Then it brings glory to the ancestors.

38
0:1:15,6 --> 0:1:18,47
What I mean is, these two things are actually the same.

39
0:1:18,47 --> 0:1:19,43
It’s one and the same thing.

40
0:1:19,43 --> 0:1:21,63
It's about realizing one's own value.

41
0:1:21,63 --> 0:1:25,42
So, realizing one's own value is the most crucial thing.

42
0:1:25,87 --> 0:1:28,45
Many years ago, my grandfather wanted to change our surname back to Tian.

43
0:1:28,45 --> 0:1:30,7
But we all opposed it.

44
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:32,63
Because we thought the name Xinrong was really cool.

45
0:1:32,63 --> 0:1:35,89
We don’t care whether it’s the maternal or paternal surname.

46
0:1:35,89 --> 0:1:37,13
It doesn’t really matter.

47
0:1:37,13 --> 0:1:39,3
So when my child was born,

48
0:1:39,3 --> 0:1:40,33
it came down to what the surname would be,

49
0:1:40,33 --> 0:1:42,229
I wasn’t particularly concerned about it.

50
0:1:42,229 --> 0:1:43,949
After all, many years ago,

51
0:1:43,949 --> 0:1:45,389
people placed a lot of importance on family lineage,

52
0:1:45,389 --> 0:1:46,689
on the continuation of bloodlines,

53
0:1:46,689 --> 0:1:49,89
and this is closely tied to inheritance,

54
0:1:49,89 --> 0:1:51,99
to the division of assets.

55
0:1:51,99 --> 0:1:53,59
What we call the son taking over the father's business

56
0:1:53,59 --> 0:1:54,37
the son carrying on the father's legacy

57
0:1:54,37 --> 0:1:55,22
is quite common

58
0:1:55,22 --> 0:1:57,62
and then there's also the issue of buying and selling land and property

59
0:1:57,62 --> 0:1:58,56
so in an agrarian society

60
0:1:58,56 --> 0:2:1,3
we see the situation where men are esteemed and women are devalued

61
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:4,34
but now we're in a stage of urbanization in major cities

62
0:2:4,34 --> 0:2:5,18
if we talk about this phase

63
0:2:5,18 --> 0:2:6,52
in the post-commercial era

64
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:8,459
It was also the age of industry and commerce.

65
0:2:8,459 --> 0:2:10,199
In this era,

66
0:2:10,199 --> 0:2:12,159
the connection to land ownership has become largely irrelevant,

67
0:2:12,159 --> 0:2:13,319
forming no direct link anymore.

68
0:2:13,319 --> 0:2:14,959
Moreover, both men and women are considered heirs.

69
0:2:14,959 --> 0:2:16,279
So, in many cases,

70
0:2:16,279 --> 0:2:17,919
this logic,

71
0:2:17,919 --> 0:2:21,57
this notion of passing down from father to son,

72
0:2:21,57 --> 0:2:23,31
no longer applies.

73
0:2:23,31 --> 0:2:25,88
The feudal land order in ancient times

74
0:2:25,88 --> 0:2:28,84
The feudal order was passed down from father to son

75
0:2:28,84 --> 0:2:31,18
It extended from father-son relationships to those between ruler and minister, husband and wife

76
0:2:31,18 --> 0:2:34,16
So, we're talking about the traditional culture of China.

77
0:2:34,16 --> 0:2:35,68
Many aspects are worth preserving

78
0:2:35,68 --> 0:2:37,64
But it’s important to know where they come from

79
0:2:37,64 --> 0:2:40,19
Understanding why they exist is key

80
0:2:40,19 --> 0:2:42,66
For example, ancient people said not to bathe at night

81
0:2:42,66 --> 0:2:44,6
And not to wash your hair at night either

82
0:2:44,6 --> 0:2:45,7
Back then, there were no hair dryers, right?

83
0:2:45,7 --> 0:2:48,6
In those days, there was no lighting at night.

84
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:49,46
A lot of things were different.

85
0:2:49,46 --> 0:2:51,6
So the logic behind it is different as well.

86
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:53,22
You don't have to worry about all the taboos of your ancestors.

87
0:2:53,22 --> 0:2:55,3
What's most important is achieving self-actualization.

88
0:2:55,3 --> 0:2:56,46
Once you achieve self-actualization,

89
0:2:56,46 --> 0:2:58,15
your ancestors will be proud of you.

90
0:2:58,15 --> 0:2:58,75
Like me

91
0:2:58,75 --> 0:3:1,31
Sometimes when I feel really drained,

92
0:3:1,31 --> 0:3:2,31
I encourage myself,

93
0:3:2,31 --> 0:3:3,35
I tell myself I was 12

94
0:3:4,95 --> 0:3:5,83
when I started the Long March.

95
0:3:5,83 --> 0:3:6,41
Right?

96
0:3:6,41 --> 0:3:7,29
Being from Ruijin,

97
0:3:7,29 --> 0:3:7,69
Right?

98
0:3:7,69 --> 0:3:8,88
I was an orphan from a young age,

99
0:3:8,88 --> 0:3:12,44
and my grandfather raised an army at a young age.

100
0:3:12,44 --> 0:3:13,64
Then they went to fight against the Japanese.

101
0:3:13,64 --> 0:3:14,8
At that time, the Eighth Route Army hadn't arrived yet.

102
0:3:14,8 --> 0:3:16,209
So in many cases,

103
0:3:16,209 --> 0:3:20,74
these people used real-life examples to motivate themselves.

104
0:3:20,74 --> 0:3:23,12
I must be the strongest child born from both families.

105
0:3:23,12 --> 0:3:24,48
This is the strongest kid.

106
0:3:24,48 --> 0:3:26,22
I usually encourage myself like this.

107
0:3:26,22 --> 0:3:29,46
But sometimes when you encounter setbacks,

108
0:3:29,46 --> 0:3:31,74
you don't have to use these things to discourage yourself.

109
0:3:31,74 --> 0:3:33,1
At any point in time,

110
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:34,67
when we evaluate a person's life,

111
0:3:34,67 --> 0:3:36,73
we talk about their lifetime achievements and faults.

112
0:3:36,73 --> 0:3:38,31
For most people,

113
0:3:38,31 --> 0:3:39,25
my ancestors,

114
0:3:39,25 --> 0:3:41,28
whether they are distant ancestors,

115
0:3:41,28 --> 0:3:45,8
or more recent ones like great-grandfathers,

116
0:3:45,8 --> 0:3:47,57
are actually quite distant lives to me.

117
0:3:47,57 --> 0:3:49,67
What truly gets passed down is some of the genes.

118
0:3:49,67 --> 0:3:52,5
All the right things these people have done

119
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:53,19
and the failures they've experienced

120
0:3:53,19 --> 0:3:54,59
are ingrained in their DNA

121
0:3:54,59 --> 0:3:55,75
passed down from generation to generation

122
0:3:55,75 --> 0:3:57,67
so this is quite interesting

123
0:3:57,67 --> 0:4:0,36
this is truly something worth commemorating

124
0:4:0,36 --> 0:4:1,64
but sometimes

125
0:4:1,64 --> 0:4:4,2
when we talk about achieving something

126
0:4:4,2 --> 0:4:5,9
it's important to align with human nature

127
0:4:5,9 --> 0:4:7,579
Sometimes it goes against human nature

128
0:4:7,579 --> 0:4:9,199
When it comes to things that align with human nature

129
0:4:9,199 --> 0:4:10,319
It's about other people

130
0:4:10,319 --> 0:4:11,819
It's about understanding how others are

131
0:4:11,819 --> 0:4:12,939
You need to respect their human nature

132
0:4:12,939 --> 0:4:14,589
You need to respect the objective laws of human behavior

133
0:4:14,589 --> 0:4:16,229
For example, if someone is cold-hearted

134
0:4:16,229 --> 0:4:18,309
Being harsh and unkind is quite normal

135
0:4:18,309 --> 0:4:19,649
You have to accept them

136
0:4:19,649 --> 0:4:20,649
For myself

137
0:4:20,649 --> 0:4:21,809
it often requires going against human nature

138
0:4:21,809 --> 0:4:24,249
for example, when we are the laziest

139
0:4:24,249 --> 0:4:26,109
the time we least want to work is precisely when we should work

140
0:4:26,109 --> 0:4:29,9
like right now, I'm comfortably lying in the hotel

141
0:4:29,9 --> 0:4:30,21
I really don't want to record a video

142
0:4:30,21 --> 0:4:31,53
But I'm going to record a video right now.

143
0:4:31,53 --> 0:4:32,95
because it's the Qingming Festival holiday

144
0:4:32,95 --> 0:4:34,53
since this is when there's a lot of traffic

145
0:4:34,53 --> 0:4:36,8
Because this is when everyone is watching

146
0:4:36,8 --> 0:4:38,64
So this is the right time to record

147
0:4:38,64 --> 0:4:40,5
So you shouldn’t be talking about not working

148
0:4:40,5 --> 0:4:42,15
This is when you should be working the most

149
0:4:42,15 --> 0:4:44,13
Like yesterday when I went to a comic convention

150
0:4:44,13 --> 0:4:47,8
Basically, we've got ten followers.

151
0:4:47,8 --> 0:4:48,32
Having ten followers is quite a lot already.

152
0:4:48,32 --> 0:4:50,16
Having ten followers is already quite a lot.

153
0:4:50,16 --> 0:4:51,56
Despite having over 600,000 followers

154
0:4:51,56 --> 0:4:54,65
But actually, it's already great to have so many people here.

155
0:4:54,65 --> 0:4:56,71
Then we had a 30-minute session.

156
0:4:56,71 --> 0:4:57,9
On stage.

157
0:4:57,9 --> 0:4:59,46
Actually, not many people spoke on the stage.

158
0:4:59,46 --> 0:5:0,58
The guest spoke for 30 minutes.

159
0:5:0,58 --> 0:5:1,9
But I was given this opportunity.

160
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:3,22
I talked about a lot of topics.

161
0:5:3,22 --> 0:5:5,58
But to be honest, in terms of the audience here,

162
0:5:5,58 --> 0:5:8,74
Most of them came to see the young cosplayers.

163
0:5:8,74 --> 0:5:10,5
So during my teens and early twenties

164
0:5:10,5 --> 0:5:12,7
people weren't particularly interested in what I had to say

165
0:5:12,7 --> 0:5:14,95
but this is when you get a chance

166
0:5:14,95 --> 0:5:16,25
an opportunity to hone your skills

167
0:5:16,25 --> 0:5:19,41
not everything is a grand moment with thunderous applause

168
0:5:19,41 --> 0:5:20,63
you don't wait for the perfect audience to speak

169
0:5:20,63 --> 0:5:22,71
often, you have to play the lute to the ox

170
0:5:22,71 --> 0:5:25,95
you might find yourself speaking to people who aren't your ideal audience

171
0:5:25,95 --> 0:5:26,76
but you still need to speak up

172
0:5:26,76 --> 0:5:27,74
What are you going to do about it?

173
0:5:27,74 --> 0:5:28,8
Right?

174
0:5:28,8 --> 0:5:29,28
Don't even mention it.

175
0:5:29,28 --> 0:5:31,12
It's on April 19th this month.

176
0:5:31,12 --> 0:5:34,599
The book's launch signing

177
0:5:34,599 --> 0:5:37,519
will take place at the Shandong Book City in Jinan, Shandong.

178
0:5:37,519 --> 0:5:38,979
It starts at two o'clock in the afternoon.

179
0:5:38,979 --> 0:5:40,89
I hope you can join us.

180
0:5:40,89 --> 0:5:42,95
Well, this is my first book, so there might be some pitfalls.

181
0:5:42,95 --> 0:5:45,35
This is the first book of my three major life strategy books.

182
0:5:45,35 --> 0:5:46,88
The second book is titled 'Perspective'.

183
0:5:46,88 --> 0:5:47,88
The third book is called 'Winner'.

184
0:5:47,88 --> 0:5:50,52
Actually, two of these books have already been completed.

185
0:5:50,52 --> 0:5:52,5
The third one is still in the planning stage.

186
0:5:52,5 --> 0:5:53,9
But the two have already been finished.

187
0:5:53,9 --> 0:5:55,3
The first one has already been published.

188
0:5:55,3 --> 0:5:58,26
And I welcome everyone to place your orders in a timely manner.

189
0:5:58,26 --> 0:6:1,22
Attending my book signing event is really a great experience.

190
0:6:1,22 --> 0:6:4,74
In life, there are many times when we can't control things.

191
0:6:4,74 --> 0:6:6,12
When we can't control the situation,

192
0:6:6,12 --> 0:6:7,51
we should learn to adapt and be content.

193
0:6:7,51 --> 0:6:9,43
And when we can control things,

194
0:6:9,43 --> 0:6:15,6
we shouldn't put too much pressure on ourselves.

195
0:6:15,6 --> 0:6:16,52
We often say we need to strive,

196
0:6:16,52 --> 0:6:17,92
but when it comes to striving,

197
0:6:17,92 --> 0:6:19,93
striving is about going with the flow of fate.

198
0:6:19,93 --> 0:6:21,89
Striving doesn't change our destiny.

199
0:6:21,89 --> 0:6:22,57
You can't change your destiny

200
0:6:22,57 --> 0:6:23,39
Who are you

201
0:6:23,39 --> 0:6:25,799
Whose memories do your genes carry

202
0:6:25,799 --> 0:6:28,179
Where will you go in this life

203
0:6:28,179 --> 0:6:29,839
Major trends can't really be altered

204
0:6:29,839 --> 0:6:31,219
But minor issues

205
0:6:31,219 --> 0:6:33,99
How many points do you think you'll score this time

206
0:6:33,99 --> 0:6:34,64
How do you think you'll perform this time

207
0:6:34,64 --> 0:6:37,6
Will you perform above or below your potential

208
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:39,2
This is something you can control yourself.

209
0:6:39,2 --> 0:6:40,87
So, when it comes to these things,

210
0:6:40,87 --> 0:6:42,51
Speaking of life in this world,

211
0:6:42,51 --> 0:6:43,81
Sometimes you need to take a risk.

212
0:6:43,81 --> 0:6:45,3
Of course, when taking a risk,

213
0:6:45,3 --> 0:6:46,67
It usually means giving it 80%,

214
0:6:46,67 --> 0:6:47,95
Or going all the way to 120%.

215
0:6:47,95 --> 0:6:50,94
But more often, when it comes to the gifts of fate,

216
0:6:50,94 --> 0:6:52,2
You can't avoid them.

217
0:6:52,2 --> 0:6:53,82
So, as a gift of fate, you know,

218
0:6:53,82 --> 0:6:54,46
no matter what,

219
0:6:54,46 --> 0:6:56,6
If you dislike this gift of fate

220
0:6:56,6 --> 0:6:56,8
you can change your destiny,

221
0:6:56,8 --> 0:6:57,22
right?

222
0:6:57,22 --> 0:6:57,72
You can change your destiny,

223
0:6:57,72 --> 0:6:59,549
and there are many ways to do it,

224
0:6:59,549 --> 0:7:0,669
we’ve mentioned,

225
0:7:0,669 --> 0:7:2,289
in the course of a lifetime,

226
0:7:2,289 --> 0:7:3,789
In my view,

227
0:7:3,789 --> 0:7:5,269
my destiny hasn't changed,

228
0:7:5,269 --> 0:7:7,64
Because my destiny has always been in tune with this main theme

229
0:7:7,64 --> 0:7:8,92
Always in my main theme

230
0:7:8,92 --> 0:7:11,5
which is the thing I most want to do, hovering around it,

231
0:7:11,5 --> 0:7:14,66
so when I move further away from this main theme,

232
0:7:14,66 --> 0:7:15,94
fate pulls me back,

233
0:7:15,94 --> 0:7:17,82
and when I get closer to the main theme,

234
0:7:17,82 --> 0:7:19,2
fate gives me a nudge,

235
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:20,9
encouraging me to focus on it,

236
0:7:20,9 --> 0:7:23,18
so to sum up,

237
0:7:23,18 --> 0:7:24,34
I believe that in terms of my destiny,

238
0:7:24,34 --> 0:7:26,7
it has always played a protective role for me,

239
0:7:26,7 --> 0:7:28,34
so it hasn't prevented me from achieving my goals,

240
0:7:28,34 --> 0:7:29,52
but rather helped me achieve them,

241
0:7:29,52 --> 0:7:30,62
this relies more on willpower,

242
0:7:30,62 --> 0:7:32,92
This thing relies more on willpower.

243
0:7:32,92 --> 0:7:34,64
so when people talk about destiny being clear and evident,

244
0:7:34,64 --> 0:7:39,64
well,

245
0:7:39,64 --> 0:7:40,48
Emperor Zhuge Liang,

246
0:7:40,48 --> 0:7:41,32
with his clear and noble spirit,

247
0:7:41,32 --> 0:7:42,38
and his bold and resolute actions,

248
0:7:42,38 --> 0:7:43,38
so often it's about realizing self-worth,

249
0:7:43,38 --> 0:7:46,46
it's a psychological suggestion to yourself,

250
0:7:46,46 --> 0:7:48,6
realizing self-worth leads to honoring your ancestors,

251
0:7:48,6 --> 0:7:51,62
so I hope everyone has a happy Qingming Festival,

252
0:7:51,62 --> 0:7:54,14
while paying respects to your ancestors,

253
0:7:54,14 --> 0:7:55,64
you should also encourage yourself,

254
0:7:55,64 --> 0:7:57,32
truly honoring your ancestors means,

255
0:7:57,32 --> 0:7:58,68
in simple terms, achieving your life's aspirations.
