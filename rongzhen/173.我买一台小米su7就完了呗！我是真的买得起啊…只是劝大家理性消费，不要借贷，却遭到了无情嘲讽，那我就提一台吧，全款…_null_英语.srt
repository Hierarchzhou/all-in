1
0:0:0,36 --> 0:0:1,44
Let me announce something.

2
0:0:1,44 --> 0:0:2,58
I have an announcement to make.

3
0:0:2,58 --> 0:0:7,6
It's about the Su7 Ultra I just bought.

4
0:0:7,6 --> 0:0:10,16
It can easily lead you down the path of debt.

5
0:0:10,16 --> 0:0:12,129
What I'm trying to say is,

6
0:0:12,129 --> 0:0:14,489
if you have 600,000 or even less than that,

7
0:0:14,489 --> 0:0:15,769
don't spend it all on a car.

8
0:0:15,769 --> 0:0:18,9
But many people clearly missed the point I was trying to make.

9
0:0:18,9 --> 0:0:20,92
Some even called me a Huawei lackey.

10
0:0:20,92 --> 0:0:22,59
Some people say I'm uh

11
0:0:22,59 --> 0:0:24,25
because I didn't get the Xiaomi ad

12
0:0:24,25 --> 0:0:26,37
I indeed didn't get the Xiaomi ad

13
0:0:26,37 --> 0:0:28,19
but am I Huawei's pet?

14
0:0:28,19 --> 0:0:30,3
Well, I am indeed Huawei's pet

15
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:32,58
because Huawei keeps sending me new phones

16
0:0:32,58 --> 0:0:36,16
I've been using several phones that Huawei sent me

17
0:0:36,16 --> 0:0:37,62
This is because I'm an internet celebrity

18
0:0:37,62 --> 0:0:40,12
So how should I put it

19
0:0:40,12 --> 0:0:41,58
Let's cut to the chase.

20
0:0:41,58 --> 0:0:42,54
I've made up my mind.

21
0:0:42,54 --> 0:0:45,42
Because on May 26th, I'll be getting a new Beijing license plate.

22
0:0:45,42 --> 0:0:46,59
I finally got lucky in the lottery.

23
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:48,67
I've decided to buy a Xiaomi S7.

24
0:0:48,67 --> 0:0:51,489
A lot of people say it's because you can't afford it.

25
0:0:51,489 --> 0:0:55,569
That's why they bash Xiaomi.

26
0:0:55,569 --> 0:0:56,73
They say Xiaomi isn't good.

27
0:0:56,73 --> 0:0:57,53
So, let's do this.

28
0:0:57,53 --> 0:0:59,37
It's because I can really afford it.

29
0:0:59,37 --> 0:1:0,99
So, I'll get one then.

30
0:1:0,99 --> 0:1:2,94
This way, you know, right?

31
0:1:2,94 --> 0:1:4,22
I'll also join the Xiaomi camp.

32
0:1:4,22 --> 0:1:5,82
It's a good thing to eat my own words.

33
0:1:5,82 --> 0:1:7,68
I think it's a really great thing.

34
0:1:7,68 --> 0:1:8,8
I can really afford the fuel.

35
0:1:8,8 --> 0:1:9,96
Actually, I could buy several.

36
0:1:9,96 --> 0:1:10,5
Right?

37
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:12,52
But I'll just get one; one is enough for me.

38
0:1:12,52 --> 0:1:13,16
Right?
