0:0:0,3 --> 0:0:0,86
Hello everyone

2
0:0:0,86 --> 0:0:2,3
This is Bed Sheet Chat episode 520

3
0:0:2,3 --> 0:0:4,76
Today we're going to talk about Trump

4
0:0:4,76 --> 0:0:6,769
Well, there's no way around it

5
0:0:6,769 --> 0:0:8,809
Originally, I didn't like going there.

6
0:0:8,809 --> 0:0:11,35
But it’s fine to talk about it, I guess

7
0:0:11,35 --> 0:0:13,61
International politics and international relations

8
0:0:13,61 --> 0:0:17,43
Although international relations was one of my postgraduate majors

9
0:0:17,43 --> 0:0:21,71
However, many international issues are complex and intricate

10
0:0:21,71 --> 0:0:23,87
Today, we really need to talk about him.

11
0:0:23,87 --> 0:0:25,3
He's imposing these tariffs.

12
0:0:25,3 --> 0:0:28,88
It's truly ridiculous, to be honest.

13
0:0:28,88 --> 0:0:34,319
You see, no industry likes being guided by amateurs.

14
0:0:34,319 --> 0:0:37,64
Amateurs guiding professionals is a really scary thing.

15
0:0:37,64 --> 0:0:39,8
If you keep messing around like this,

16
0:0:39,8 --> 0:0:41,32
it can actually be quite dangerous at times.

17
0:0:41,32 --> 0:0:43,12
And a lot of people are saying,

18
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:45,9
who exactly should be the right person for this?

19
0:0:45,9 --> 0:0:47,1
To become a statesman

20
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:50,989
When talking about a statesman, the first thing to note is the need for a strong foundation in the humanities and social sciences.

21
0:0:50,989 --> 0:0:53,749
And also, they need to have administrative experience at the grassroots level

22
0:0:53,749 --> 0:0:57,6
This is what it takes to be a qualified statesman.

23
0:0:57,6 --> 0:0:58,24
In this regard

24
0:0:58,24 --> 0:1:2,42
The candidates we cultivate are thoroughly vetted by the UK

25
0:1:2,42 --> 0:1:6,599
The organization conducts very detailed reviews of all kinds

26
0:1:6,599 --> 0:1:8,519
And then their actual performance is evaluated

27
0:1:8,519 --> 0:1:10,359
Only then is there a possibility of promotion

28
0:1:10,359 --> 0:1:11,39
That's how it is.

29
0:1:11,39 --> 0:1:13,199
So the officials we select here,

30
0:1:13,199 --> 0:1:16,26
many of them are extremely professional.

31
0:1:16,26 --> 0:1:18,83
But in the Western system,

32
0:1:18,83 --> 0:1:20,89
someone might have been an actor yesterday,

33
0:1:20,89 --> 0:1:22,45
or a drama teacher yesterday,

34
0:1:22,45 --> 0:1:23,49
like Zelensky,

35
0:1:23,49 --> 0:1:25,27
or the Little Potato,

36
0:1:25,27 --> 0:1:28,17
It was the guest from yesterday's talk show, right?

37
0:1:28,17 --> 0:1:29,31
For example, Trump

38
0:1:29,31 --> 0:1:32,14
could become a political rising star tomorrow

39
0:1:32,14 --> 0:1:35,76
I mentioned before that Musk is doing this funding

40
0:1:35,76 --> 0:1:37,42
working on this Dogecoin

41
0:1:37,42 --> 0:1:38,86
operating with this efficiency

42
0:1:38,86 --> 0:1:43,2
the head of the resource department will have significant issues

43
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:47,1
and then, his stock prices have been plummeting lately

44
0:1:47,1 --> 0:1:48,38
it’s not that there’s a rumor going around

45
0:1:48,38 --> 0:1:49,46
Rubio said he saw it

46
0:1:49,46 --> 0:1:52,56
He was in the Oval Office, hugging a large picture of Trump.

47
0:1:52,56 --> 0:1:54,229
Trump was crying on his thigh.

48
0:1:54,229 --> 0:1:55,789
When it comes to politics,

49
0:1:55,789 --> 0:1:58,389
it's best not to let amateurs guide professionals.

50
0:1:58,389 --> 0:1:59,469
Let's talk about it.

51
0:1:59,469 --> 0:2:1,869
I often discuss the issue of Machiavellianism with everyone.

52
0:2:1,869 --> 0:2:2,789
Speaking of Machiavelli,

53
0:2:2,789 --> 0:2:5,8
if you don't read Machiavelli,

54
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:6,8
it's actually about the traditional Western politics.

55
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:7,88
You wouldn't understand.

56
0:2:7,88 --> 0:2:11,56
Especially in the Western world during the Renaissance era of the Middle Ages,

57
0:2:11,56 --> 0:2:12,65
For instance, let's say,

58
0:2:12,65 --> 0:2:14,13
if you see a rabbit,

59
0:2:14,13 --> 0:2:15,69
when you spot a rabbit,

60
0:2:15,69 --> 0:2:18,53
you should decisively get rid of it.

61
0:2:18,53 --> 0:2:18,97
Why is that?

62
0:2:18,97 --> 0:2:21,32
Because rabbits have a very strong reproductive rate.

63
0:2:21,32 --> 0:2:23,48
If you don't kill the first rabbit today,

64
0:2:23,48 --> 0:2:25,8
Tomorrow, it could be hundreds or even thousands.

65
0:2:25,8 --> 0:2:26,72
That’s why

66
0:2:26,72 --> 0:2:28,13
In the Western era,

67
0:2:28,13 --> 0:2:29,79
regarding religious heresy,

68
0:2:29,79 --> 0:2:31,25
the eradication of cults

69
0:2:31,25 --> 0:2:33,9
had to be particularly swift and decisive.

70
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:35,22
Because if you let it grow,

71
0:2:35,22 --> 0:2:36,6
many things are like this,

72
0:2:36,6 --> 0:2:37,88
you need to nip them in the bud.

73
0:2:37,88 --> 0:2:40,6
You need to eliminate it after it has developed.

74
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:42,88
That's truly terrifying.

75
0:2:42,88 --> 0:2:46,56
However, Western countries often lack such governance experience.

76
0:2:46,56 --> 0:2:48,28
And the tradition of such governance.

77
0:2:48,28 --> 0:2:51,27
So, this is sometimes reflected in their administrative shortcomings.

78
0:2:51,27 --> 0:2:52,89
Some things just don't work out.

79
0:2:52,89 --> 0:2:53,87
They think for a long time.

80
0:2:53,87 --> 0:2:55,71
Now why many statesmen in Europe

81
0:2:55,71 --> 0:2:57,98
Frankly, they are all second or third-rate statesmen.

82
0:2:57,98 --> 0:2:59,84
They're all a bunch of bleeding hearts.

83
0:2:59,84 --> 0:3:0,82
Actually, a lot of the time,

84
0:3:0,82 --> 0:3:4,579
his skills are really far inferior to those of the past.

85
0:3:4,579 --> 0:3:7,279
Why can't we be saints at the second point?

86
0:3:7,279 --> 0:3:8,739
Especially medieval Europe

87
0:3:8,739 --> 0:3:9,939
you can't just be a

88
0:3:9,939 --> 0:3:11,599
like, for instance, the kingdom,

89
0:3:11,599 --> 0:3:14,34
the Poland of the Age of Salvation,

90
0:3:14,34 --> 0:3:15,72
or the Czech era in Europe.

91
0:3:15,72 --> 0:3:17,72
So, you can't start by aiding refugees

92
0:3:17,72 --> 0:3:18,3
Aiding refugees

93
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:18,9
Assisting disaster victims

94
0:3:18,9 --> 0:3:20,22
Including during epidemics and such

95
0:3:20,22 --> 0:3:21,74
If you're particularly kind-hearted

96
0:3:21,74 --> 0:3:23,86
You might start distributing supplies to the people

97
0:3:23,86 --> 0:3:25,42
But that's different from how our country operates

98
0:3:25,42 --> 0:3:28,51
Our country is, well, unified in a grand way

99
0:3:28,51 --> 0:3:30,19
We are an empire, after all

100
0:3:30,19 --> 0:3:30,899
Whether it's the Qing Empire

101
0:3:30,899 --> 0:3:31,339
or the Ming Empire

102
0:3:31,339 --> 0:3:32,219
it was an empire

103
0:3:32,219 --> 0:3:34,279
in ancient times, during our feudal era

104
0:3:34,279 --> 0:3:36,269
we actually weren't feudal

105
0:3:36,269 --> 0:3:38,629
they established feudal states

106
0:3:38,629 --> 0:3:41,25
if you provided relief to disaster victims back then

107
0:3:41,25 --> 0:3:43,17
it wasn't a unified action

108
0:3:43,17 --> 0:3:44,81
once you started providing relief to disaster victims

109
0:3:44,81 --> 0:3:45,33
Refugees

110
0:3:45,33 --> 0:3:46,37
These refugees

111
0:3:46,37 --> 0:3:49,1
Disaster victims will flock to your city-state

112
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:51,24
This will cause your economy to collapse immediately

113
0:3:51,24 --> 0:3:53,32
So in medieval Europe, quite often,

114
0:3:53,32 --> 0:3:56,0
It’s not a matter of one side being benevolent

115
0:3:56,0 --> 0:3:58,88
Sometimes, being a statesman requires having a heart of stone.

116
0:3:58,88 --> 0:4:0,38
Being extremely ruthless is necessary

117
0:4:0,38 --> 0:4:4,62
The principles of Western politics differ from those of Eastern politics

118
0:4:4,62 --> 0:4:7,72
It's quite different, relatively speaking.

119
0:4:7,72 --> 0:4:9,36
But when we talk about the Legalist school of thought,

120
0:4:9,36 --> 0:4:12,49
including what Han Feizi discussed, there are many aspects to consider.

121
0:4:12,49 --> 0:4:14,93
If you truly understand him,

122
0:4:15,9 --> 0:4:18,89
you'll realize that the Legalists talk about the dark rules of politics.

123
0:4:18,89 --> 0:4:20,79
As I mentioned earlier, the theory of killing the rabbit,

124
0:4:20,79 --> 0:4:24,23
or we could say, this theory about not being able to aid refugees,

125
0:4:24,23 --> 0:4:25,7
this theory,

126
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:26,19
and there's also a third theory.

127
0:4:26,19 --> 0:4:29,129
So, are you referring to primogeniture?

128
0:4:29,129 --> 0:4:31,189
If your wife's relatives are very powerful,

129
0:4:31,189 --> 0:4:34,49
you're likely to be poisoned in your old age.

130
0:4:34,49 --> 0:4:38,24
Because establishing a region,

131
0:4:38,24 --> 0:4:39,84
as you get older,

132
0:4:39,84 --> 0:4:41,2
you'll keep having children,

133
0:4:41,2 --> 0:4:41,44
right?

134
0:4:41,44 --> 0:4:43,299
After having children, you'll grow fond of them,

135
0:4:43,299 --> 0:4:44,859
and the young children's mothers.

136
0:4:44,859 --> 0:4:45,259
Is that right?

137
0:4:45,259 --> 0:4:47,459
Then the relatives of those people might take advantage of it.

138
0:4:47,459 --> 0:4:48,619
So, at that time,

139
0:4:48,619 --> 0:4:50,17
the more wives you have,

140
0:4:50,17 --> 0:4:52,51
it actually turns into a power struggle over inheritance.

141
0:4:52,51 --> 0:4:53,37
Throughout history,

142
0:4:57,1 --> 0:5:0,5
the safest method has been to promote the heir to a higher position.

143
0:5:0,5 --> 0:5:1,33
promoting the heir early,

144
0:5:1,33 --> 0:5:2,27
What should we do then?

145
0:5:2,27 --> 0:5:2,8
Right?

146
0:5:2,8 --> 0:5:4,76
So, dying would be the best option for you.

147
0:5:4,76 --> 0:5:6,16
If his relatives aren’t powerful,

148
0:5:6,16 --> 0:5:7,22
he’s the one who will end up dead.

149
0:5:7,22 --> 0:5:9,72
Because there will be others who want to take his place.

150
0:5:9,72 --> 0:5:12,12
So why are you playing Crusader Kings

151
0:5:12,12 --> 0:5:15,31
some wives whose family isn’t strong often

152
0:5:15,31 --> 0:5:17,15
end up being poisoned to death.

153
0:5:17,15 --> 0:5:19,29
This is actually a very realistic issue.

154
0:5:19,29 --> 0:5:22,37
In reality, all countries have issues of inheritance.

155
0:5:22,37 --> 0:5:23,93
This is also a matter of war.

156
0:5:23,93 --> 0:5:25,93
This isn't just about ancient times, though.

157
0:5:25,93 --> 0:5:28,12
Look at what the U.S. is doing now.

158
0:5:28,32 --> 0:5:31,28
Actually, I generally avoid commenting on American affairs.

159
0:5:31,28 --> 0:5:32,76
Because when it comes to these things,

160
0:5:32,76 --> 0:5:33,72
once you start commenting,

161
0:5:33,72 --> 0:5:38,1
it's easy to open a can of worms,

162
0:5:38,1 --> 0:5:39,82
and find it's full of maggots.

163
0:5:39,82 --> 0:5:40,92
This is exactly the kind of issue.

164
0:5:40,92 --> 0:5:42,9
So his problem is actually very serious.

165
0:5:42,9 --> 0:5:48,54
You can't give this to someone who isn't a traditional statesman.

166
0:5:48,54 --> 0:5:50,15
Excessive power.

167
0:5:50,15 --> 0:5:51,27
Of course,

168
0:5:51,27 --> 0:5:52,23
By doing this,

169
0:5:52,23 --> 0:5:55,71
It's very likely to exacerbate the problem.

170
0:5:55,71 --> 0:5:57,53
As I often say,

171
0:5:57,53 --> 0:6:0,99
A competent statesman should have a very good command of the humanities and social sciences.

172
0:6:0,99 --> 0:6:2,99
But I've always advised everyone to do this

173
0:6:2,99 --> 0:6:5,19
When you're young and your brain is sharp

174
0:6:5,19 --> 0:6:7,83
Learn science and engineering when you have the physical strength

175
0:6:7,83 --> 0:6:11,7
When you're older, in your thirties or forties, around my age

176
0:6:11,7 --> 0:6:11,83
Your energy isn't what it used to be

177
0:6:11,83 --> 0:6:12,63
Your physical functions decline

178
0:6:12,63 --> 0:6:14,83
That's when you can turn to studying history, geography, and politics

179
0:6:14,83 --> 0:6:15,99
Study historiography

180
0:6:15,99 --> 0:6:16,43
Study sociology

181
0:6:16,43 --> 0:6:16,97
Political science

182
0:6:16,97 --> 0:6:18,45
the study of international relations

183
0:6:18,45 --> 0:6:19,29
psychology

184
0:6:19,29 --> 0:6:21,75
and some philosophy and such

185
0:6:21,75 --> 0:6:25,52
we can say that these six subjects can be learned even when we're older

186
0:6:25,52 --> 0:6:27,2
especially

187
0:6:27,2 --> 0:6:29,2
not knowing history is quite dangerous

188
0:6:29,2 --> 0:6:30,14
because

189
0:6:30,14 --> 0:6:31,909
the last tariff increase

190
0:6:31,909 --> 0:6:35,869
In the 1920s and 1930s in America, tariffs were haphazardly added.

191
0:6:35,869 --> 0:6:38,56
This led to an economic crisis.

192
0:6:38,56 --> 0:6:41,8
Prior to that, it was also between the UK and the US.

193
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:43,7
Trade between European countries also triggered an economic crisis.

194
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:47,32
World War I was, to some extent, sparked by such issues.

195
0:6:47,32 --> 0:6:48,96
If you don't study history,

196
0:6:48,96 --> 0:6:50,72
you'll fall into a global recession.

197
0:6:50,72 --> 0:6:51,76
That's how it started.

198
0:6:51,76 --> 0:6:53,37
So if you do this,

199
0:6:53,37 --> 0:6:55,43
It would ruin the economies of all countries

200
0:6:55,43 --> 0:6:56,29
Now, talking about it

201
0:6:56,29 --> 0:6:59,1
Our countermeasures were absolutely timely

202
0:6:59,1 --> 0:7:0,53
Because if you don’t act in time

203
0:7:0,53 --> 0:7:1,789
It would be useless

204
0:7:1,789 --> 0:7:3,629
And the more we talk about it now

205
0:7:3,629 --> 0:7:5,869
You have to force the other side to back down

206
0:7:5,869 --> 0:7:8,84
So, there’s no other way

207
0:7:8,84 --> 0:7:9,6
That’s just how it is

208
0:7:9,6 --> 0:7:11,48
So, you're not a professional statesman.

209
0:7:11,48 --> 0:7:13,24
There are certain things you just don't understand.

210
0:7:14,32 --> 0:7:15,52
Often, it's not what you imagine.

211
0:7:15,52 --> 0:7:17,64
It's not how you picture it in your mind.

212
0:7:17,64 --> 0:7:21,32
For instance, when he asked KUSHA to find an economist,

213
0:7:21,32 --> 0:7:24,36
I just found an author of a bestseller on Amazon

214
0:7:24,36 --> 0:7:27,82
Turns out, the author mostly cited their own work.

215
0:7:28,2 --> 0:7:29,22
To create a piece of work.

216
0:7:29,22 --> 0:7:31,7
You can find related information in English news reports.

217
0:7:31,7 --> 0:7:32,98
He has mentioned this issue before.

218
0:7:32,98 --> 0:7:34,92
Regarding the tariffs he imposed,

219
0:7:34,92 --> 0:7:37,8
the impact on the economy is a concept he's not well-versed in.

220
0:7:37,8 --> 0:7:39,549
Actually, he didn't study this field.

221
0:7:39,549 --> 0:7:41,629
As for the actual effects of tariffs,

222
0:7:41,629 --> 0:7:44,429
he doesn't even know what the RAF is used for.

223
0:7:44,429 --> 0:7:45,789
So, he believes that

224
0:7:45,789 --> 0:7:47,659
this will lead to the return of manufacturing jobs.

225
0:7:47,659 --> 0:7:50,739
But if he truly wants to bring manufacturing back,

226
0:7:50,739 --> 0:7:52,84
It's what should be done

227
0:7:52,84 --> 0:7:56,1
It's about invading Canada or Mexico

228
0:7:56,1 --> 0:7:57,56
And then invade Greenland

229
0:7:57,56 --> 0:8:0,52
Once you successfully invade Mexico

230
0:8:0,52 --> 0:8:2,84
You'll gain a large manufacturing workforce

231
0:8:2,84 --> 0:8:4,8
Effectively bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.

232
0:8:4,8 --> 0:8:9,21
It's unlikely that these people will regain control of the manufacturing industry

233
0:8:9,21 --> 0:8:10,57
Because these American workers

234
0:8:10,57 --> 0:8:14,63
To put it bluntly, they lack the modern skills

235
0:8:14,63 --> 0:8:17,35
A kind of worker's quality

236
0:8:17,35 --> 0:8:19,5
Whether it's in terms of physical fitness

237
0:8:19,5 --> 0:8:21,1
Or for instance, when there's nothing to do

238
0:8:21,1 --> 0:8:23,82
Some people have a more laid-back lifestyle

239
0:8:23,82 --> 0:8:25,64
So their physical fitness might not be as good

240
0:8:25,64 --> 0:8:28,0
They wouldn't be as tough as Mexican workers

241
0:8:28,0 --> 0:8:30,76
So if he has these Mexican workers under his control

242
0:8:30,76 --> 0:8:33,77
And also has the resources from Canada and Greenan

243
0:8:33,77 --> 0:8:35,77
Other countries would really have no way to deal with him

244
0:8:35,77 --> 0:8:37,57
And his defense stocks will soar.

245
0:8:37,57 --> 0:8:38,81
So these things of his,

246
0:8:38,81 --> 0:8:41,89
his MUA groups will become even more fanatical.

247
0:8:41,89 --> 0:8:43,61
But if you do this,

248
0:8:43,61 --> 0:8:44,95
the economy will keep deteriorating,

249
0:8:44,95 --> 0:8:46,45
and the people's livelihood will suffer more,

250
0:8:46,45 --> 0:8:50,39
which will expedite the downfall of the Trump administration.

251
0:8:50,39 --> 0:8:53,12
Especially with Musk getting involved,

252
0:8:53,12 --> 0:8:53,8
you just cut the staff.

253
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:55,8
You know this thing about layoffs

254
0:8:55,8 --> 0:8:57,3
This thing is like toilet paper

255
0:8:57,3 --> 0:8:58,6
This piece of toilet paper

256
0:8:58,6 --> 0:9:0,689
It might only have 20% used

257
0:9:0,689 --> 0:9:2,569
80% of it is unused

258
0:9:2,569 --> 0:9:5,79
But if you cut that 80% off

259
0:9:5,79 --> 0:9:7,23
It just leaves the part with... you know

260
0:9:7,23 --> 0:9:8,75
If that 20% is all there is

261
0:9:8,75 --> 0:9:10,43
You’ll end up with it all over your hands

262
0:9:10,43 --> 0:9:11,35
There are so many things

263
0:9:11,35 --> 0:9:13,27
Many positions are like this

264
0:9:13,27 --> 0:9:15,23
When he's not contributing anymore

265
0:9:15,23 --> 0:9:16,75
You think he's no longer useful

266
0:9:16,75 --> 0:9:18,95
It's like a company thinking it's all about sales

267
0:9:18,95 --> 0:9:19,83
Or it's all about R&D

268
0:9:19,83 --> 0:9:21,51
Then there's HR and administration, all over the place

269
0:9:21,51 --> 0:9:22,56
What about maintenance

270
0:9:22,56 --> 0:9:24,0
What's the point of all that mess

271
0:9:24,0 --> 0:9:25,4
What's the point of public relations?

272
0:9:25,4 --> 0:9:25,76
What's the use of marketing?

273
0:9:25,76 --> 0:9:26,79
Everything was given to him.

274
0:9:26,79 --> 0:9:28,55
But when you really open everything up,

275
0:9:28,55 --> 0:9:29,75
When only sales and R&D are left,

276
0:9:29,75 --> 0:9:31,11
You realize you can't do anything.

277
0:9:31,11 --> 0:9:32,9
Many things are like this.

278
0:9:32,9 --> 0:9:33,55
Isn't the car just the wheels turning?

279
0:9:33,55 --> 0:9:35,81
It's the wheels that keep everyone moving.

280
0:9:35,81 --> 0:9:38,15
So, wouldn't the car just need wheels and a body?

281
0:9:38,15 --> 0:9:39,73
Hey, you realize you need wheels and a body.

282
0:9:39,73 --> 0:9:40,41
What about the drive shaft?

283
0:9:40,41 --> 0:9:41,69
What a mess.

284
0:9:41,69 --> 0:9:43,29
What about the throttle and other components?

285
0:9:43,29 --> 0:9:44,55
That would be a disaster, right?

286
0:9:44,55 --> 0:9:46,86
So, that's how it often is.

287
0:9:47,26 --> 0:9:50,2
So, when we talk about anything,

288
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:52,92
we shouldn't let amateurs guide experts.

289
0:9:52,92 --> 0:9:54,64
If he continues on this path,

290
0:9:54,64 --> 0:9:56,1
the global economy will fall into recession.

291
0:9:56,1 --> 0:9:58,74
That's a given.

292
0:9:58,74 --> 0:10:0,84
And I'm not even talking from an economic standpoint,

293
0:10:0,84 --> 0:10:1,8
because when it comes to economics,

294
0:10:1,8 --> 0:10:2,6
I'm a layman.

295
0:10:2,6 --> 0:10:4,96
But from the statesman's perspective, speaking philosophically,

296
0:10:4,96 --> 0:10:7,98
Machiavelli was quite clear,

297
0:10:8,58 --> 0:10:11,24
politics, after all, is about...

298
0:10:11,24 --> 0:10:16,96
It's a synthesis that balances the interests of all parties.

299
0:10:16,96 --> 0:10:18,0
For many people,

300
0:10:18,0 --> 0:10:19,76
they think all the tricks are in one hand.

301
0:10:19,76 --> 0:10:21,98
Turning a single advantage into a hundred.

302
0:10:21,98 --> 0:10:24,42
Actually, being a good manager,

303
0:10:24,42 --> 0:10:27,52
a manager with political power,

304
0:10:28,65 --> 0:10:31,89
is not easy at all.

305
0:10:33,72 --> 0:10:35,2
The so-called art of politics,

306
0:10:35,2 --> 0:10:36,5
political science

307
0:10:36,5 --> 0:10:37,14
Science

308
0:10:37,14 --> 0:10:38,24
when it comes to many things

309
0:10:38,24 --> 0:10:38,88
in terms of governance

310
0:10:38,88 --> 0:10:40,28
it involves the hearts and minds of people

311
0:10:40,28 --> 0:10:41,69
it involves economic principles

312
0:10:41,69 --> 0:10:43,5
it involves military conflict

313
0:10:43,5 --> 0:10:44,5
and intelligence operations

314
0:10:44,5 --> 0:10:46,89
in fact, much of the time it's a very complex matter

315
0:10:46,89 --> 0:10:50,31
like when Netanyahu goes for an interview today

316
0:10:50,31 --> 0:10:51,3
Not for an interview

317
0:10:51,3 --> 0:10:52,75
To pay a visit to Trump, huh

318
0:10:52,75 --> 0:10:56,51
When is the best time to establish a friendship with someone

319
0:10:56,51 --> 0:10:58,45
It's when they are deserted by everyone

320
0:10:58,45 --> 0:11:0,77
Trump is at the lowest point in his life right now

321
0:11:0,77 --> 0:11:3,92
So offering him a helping hand at this moment

322
0:11:3,92 --> 0:11:5,36
Would be very useful

323
0:11:5,36 --> 0:11:6,48
Jews are business people

324
0:11:6,48 --> 0:11:7,68
Jews are very smart

325
0:11:7,68 --> 0:11:11,34
Netanyahu is a figure that everyone wants to distance themselves from at this stage.

326
0:11:11,34 --> 0:11:13,2
So, at this point,

327
0:11:13,2 --> 0:11:15,3
if any place,

328
0:11:15,3 --> 0:11:17,1
country or business group,

329
0:11:17,1 --> 0:11:18,41
or intelligence organization,

330
0:11:18,41 --> 0:11:21,53
if you move closer to Israel now,

331
0:11:21,53 --> 0:11:24,55
it’s actually the best time to show goodwill towards Israel.

332
0:11:24,55 --> 0:11:27,75
That is to say, if you’re not overtly, for example, as a country,

333
0:11:27,75 --> 0:11:29,11
you can’t have relations with Israel.

334
0:11:29,11 --> 0:11:31,77
But at this point, you are a business group

335
0:11:31,77 --> 0:11:33,23
or some other entities

336
0:11:33,23 --> 0:11:34,21
such as law enforcement agencies

337
0:11:34,21 --> 0:11:36,37
if you engage in unofficial interactions with Israel

338
0:11:36,37 --> 0:11:38,85
at this time, they would feel quite

339
0:11:38,85 --> 0:11:41,319
how to put it

340
0:11:41,319 --> 0:11:42,59
appreciated

341
0:11:42,59 --> 0:11:43,179
Getting attention

342
0:11:43,179 --> 0:11:45,69
making it more effective than usual

343
0:11:45,69 --> 0:11:48,31
It's not that what they do is just.

344
0:11:48,31 --> 0:11:50,41
It's precisely because what they do is unjust.

345
0:11:50,41 --> 0:11:52,69
They are in a phase where they have lost support from all sides.

346
0:11:52,69 --> 0:11:56,17
This is the time when any political support for them,

347
0:11:56,17 --> 0:11:58,95
or private relationship enhancement,

348
0:11:58,95 --> 0:12:0,33
is actually the best opportunity.

349
0:12:0,33 --> 0:12:1,27
So, in this sense,

350
0:12:1,27 --> 0:12:4,71
it's like the most unpopular kid in your class,

351
0:12:4,71 --> 0:12:6,589
the ones who are least liked by everyone.

352
0:12:6,589 --> 0:12:8,469
If you suddenly start being particularly nice to him,

353
0:12:8,469 --> 0:12:9,469
he will rely on you,

354
0:12:9,469 --> 0:12:10,689
he will depend on you.

355
0:12:10,689 --> 0:12:13,309
And when two people who were especially bad with each other suddenly,

356
0:12:13,309 --> 0:12:15,16
they tend to team up.

357
0:12:15,16 --> 0:12:15,68
That's how it goes.

358
0:12:15,68 --> 0:12:17,56
Then they become a menace that everyone wants to get rid of.

359
0:12:17,56 --> 0:12:18,4
But speaking of it,

360
0:12:18,4 --> 0:12:22,2
we're talking about some political matters today.

361
0:12:22,9 --> 0:12:25,48
There are things you should do and things you shouldn't.

362
0:12:25,48 --> 0:12:26,5
In many cases,

363
0:12:26,5 --> 0:12:27,34
so you need to understand,

364
0:12:27,34 --> 0:12:28,58
if you don't know political science,

365
0:12:28,58 --> 0:12:29,58
or international relations,

366
0:12:29,58 --> 0:12:30,78
in many situations,

367
0:12:30,78 --> 0:12:32,36
you also don't know economics,

368
0:12:32,47 --> 0:12:34,45
you have no knowledge of the humanities,

369
0:12:34,45 --> 0:12:35,5
you can only improvise.

370
0:12:35,5 --> 0:12:37,48
You can only use the art of people's hearts.

371
0:12:37,48 --> 0:12:38,66
The art of deals, you know.

372
0:12:38,66 --> 0:12:40,34
Why do I dare to criticize Trump?

373
0:12:40,34 --> 0:12:43,579
Because I've read his books, like The Art of the Deal.

374
0:12:43,579 --> 0:12:47,79
He's actually a very successful

375
0:12:47,79 --> 0:12:49,94
narcissistic type of player.

376
0:12:49,94 --> 0:12:51,34
Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or NPD.

377
0:12:51,34 --> 0:12:52,52
You could say he has NPD.

378
0:12:52,52 --> 0:12:55,13
But you could also argue he doesn't quite reach the stage of NPD.

379
0:12:55,13 --> 0:12:57,69
When it comes to manipulating people's emotions, he's quite skilled.

380
0:12:57,69 --> 0:13:0,57
Especially in interpersonal matters, he does pretty well.

381
0:13:0,57 --> 0:13:3,4
But he has a keen understanding of social structure,

382
0:13:3,4 --> 0:13:6,349
and the international relations and geopolitical landscape,

383
0:13:6,349 --> 0:13:7,629
economic matters,

384
0:13:7,629 --> 0:13:9,649
diplomatic issues, and such,

385
0:13:9,649 --> 0:13:11,329
especially political matters,

386
0:13:11,329 --> 0:13:13,77
he might not be as knowledgeable.

387
0:13:13,77 --> 0:13:17,35
Let's talk about the various eras in Chinese history.

388
0:13:17,35 --> 0:13:18,93
For example, there was the Eastern Jin Dynasty

389
0:13:18,93 --> 0:13:20,21
with its aristocratic clans

390
0:13:20,21 --> 0:13:21,78
an era of political rise

391
0:13:21,78 --> 0:13:23,72
and during the Ming Dynasty, there was the Cabinet

392
0:13:23,72 --> 0:13:24,26
right?

393
0:13:24,26 --> 0:13:26,88
and the Qing and Yuan Dynasties

394
0:13:26,88 --> 0:13:29,72
had various noble and elite groups

395
0:13:29,72 --> 0:13:31,2
so in many cases

396
0:13:31,2 --> 0:13:32,44
over the centuries

397
0:13:32,44 --> 0:13:34,92
We have always been in conflict with these clan groups

398
0:13:34,92 --> 0:13:36,4
elite groups

399
0:13:36,4 --> 0:13:38,35
and noble factions

400
0:13:38,35 --> 0:13:40,51
But in the era of the people, things are different

401
0:13:40,51 --> 0:13:41,79
So, when it comes to many aspects

402
0:13:41,79 --> 0:13:43,51
We are unique throughout history

403
0:13:43,51 --> 0:13:45,68
And we have a wealth of

404
0:13:45,68 --> 0:13:48,26
historical experience to draw upon

405
0:13:48,26 --> 0:13:48,92
for any matter

406
0:13:48,92 --> 0:13:50,2
For instance, the Five Barbarians' Invasion

407
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:51,42
or the Migration of the Gentry to the South

408
0:13:51,42 --> 0:13:52,569
In many cases

409
0:13:52,569 --> 0:13:54,109
what's trivial and what's significant

410
0:13:54,109 --> 0:13:55,629
how much effort should be applied to what

411
0:13:55,629 --> 0:13:57,89
we are quite clear about that

412
0:13:57,89 --> 0:13:58,549
For example, when it comes to dealing with cults

413
0:13:58,549 --> 0:13:59,969
we are absolutely clear

414
0:13:59,969 --> 0:14:1,329
and very decisive

415
0:14:1,329 --> 0:14:4,989
Because historically, we've suffered from this issue far too many times.

416
0:14:4,989 --> 0:14:6,329
For example, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

417
0:14:6,329 --> 0:14:9,46
Of course, everyone has a different concept of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

418
0:14:9,46 --> 0:14:10,6
Some people say,

419
0:14:10,6 --> 0:14:11,14
The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was revolutionary.

420
0:14:11,14 --> 0:14:11,86
That's different.

421
0:14:11,86 --> 0:14:13,56
Of course, the perspective varies.

422
0:14:13,56 --> 0:14:14,76
The angle makes a difference.

423
0:14:16,96 --> 0:14:18,84
So, that should be to erase it.

424
0:14:18,84 --> 0:14:19,42
Right or wrong

425
0:14:19,42 --> 0:14:21,58
But you have to look at it from the perspective of the people's revolutionary history

426
0:14:21,58 --> 0:14:23,14
If we view it from this people's historical perspective

427
0:14:23,14 --> 0:14:25,22
The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was also a proactive force in various ways.

428
0:14:25,22 --> 0:14:26,2
However, speaking of which

429
0:14:26,2 --> 0:14:28,86
If we carefully analyze it

430
0:14:28,86 --> 0:14:30,9
Regarding the entire process of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

431
0:14:33,62 --> 0:14:34,42
Of course, when we talk about it

432
0:14:34,42 --> 0:14:35,66
This is a case of everyone having their own interpretation

433
0:14:35,66 --> 0:14:36,5
Well, everyone has their own reasons.

434
0:14:36,5 --> 0:14:37,1
It doesn't really matter.

435
0:14:37,1 --> 0:14:39,1
Let me tell you something.

436
0:14:39,1 --> 0:14:42,86
Guys just love to argue about history and military stuff.

437
0:14:42,86 --> 0:14:44,3
So, it includes both arts and sciences.

438
0:14:44,3 --> 0:14:46,2
All these things in history.

439
0:14:46,2 --> 0:14:47,14
As long as it's a guy,

440
0:14:47,14 --> 0:14:49,2
Once you mention it, they're drawn in.

441
0:14:49,2 --> 0:14:50,64
And if the concept is different from his,

442
0:14:50,64 --> 0:14:51,16
He just scolded

443
0:14:51,16 --> 0:14:52,0
And that's how it is

444
0:14:52,0 --> 0:14:53,16
Then the traffic picked up

445
0:14:53,16 --> 0:14:54,97
That's just how it works

446
0:14:55,37 --> 0:14:57,89
So today, we're still talking about any issue

447
0:14:57,89 --> 0:15:1,3
There's always the problem of amateurs not guiding professionals

448
0:15:1,3 --> 0:15:2,75
So, it still comes down to the statesman

449
0:15:2,75 --> 0:15:5,39
Professional statesmen deal with political issues

450
0:15:5,39 --> 0:15:8,15
And professional diplomats handle diplomatic issues

451
0:15:8,15 --> 0:15:10,35
Professional economists deal with economic issues.

452
0:15:10,35 --> 0:15:10,91
Some people say,

453
0:15:10,91 --> 0:15:12,79
I know more than they do.

454
0:15:12,79 --> 0:15:14,639
It's precisely because you know nothing,

455
0:15:14,639 --> 0:15:17,679
that you feel you understand more than others.

456
0:15:17,679 --> 0:15:18,979
Because of belief,

457
0:15:18,979 --> 0:15:21,73
knowledge has its own gaps.

458
0:15:21,73 --> 0:15:22,97
When you first start out,

459
0:15:22,97 --> 0:15:24,4
you think you understand everything.

460
0:15:24,4 --> 0:15:25,56
After some time has passed

461
0:15:25,56 --> 0:15:28,36
you'll find yourself in a profound and deep challenge

462
0:15:28,36 --> 0:15:29,84
it's at this moment that you learn how to

463
0:15:29,84 --> 0:15:31,9
feel like you can't climb out of this abyss

464
0:15:31,9 --> 0:15:34,74
but later, when you've learned a great deal

465
0:15:34,74 --> 0:15:35,6
you'll realize

466
0:15:35,6 --> 0:15:36,78
that you've become more balanced

467
0:15:36,78 --> 0:15:37,34
it's just like that

468
0:15:37,34 --> 0:15:38,58
when you first start to understand

469
0:15:38,58 --> 0:15:40,18
Just like when you start practicing martial arts

470
0:15:40,18 --> 0:15:42,2
You really love challenging others to a match

471
0:15:42,2 --> 0:15:44,16
But as you practice more and more

472
0:15:44,16 --> 0:15:45,4
And see more masters

473
0:15:45,4 --> 0:15:48,0
You won't be so eager to engage in life-or-death duels

474
0:15:48,0 --> 0:15:50,72
Because those things can't be resolved through life-or-death duels

475
0:15:50,72 --> 0:15:54,16
So a person with a lot of knowledge won't compete with others

476
0:15:54,16 --> 0:15:56,15
On the contrary, someone with less knowledge

477
0:15:56,15 --> 0:15:57,7
Is often more eager to prove themselves

478
0:15:57,7 --> 0:15:58,55
A half-bottle of water

479
0:15:58,55 --> 0:16:0,41
A half-bottle of vinegar is bustling about

480
0:16:0,41 --> 0:16:3,66
This person tends to easily get into verbal spats with others

481
0:16:3,66 --> 0:16:6,4
So I’ve been through my teens and twenties too

482
0:16:6,4 --> 0:16:6,5
Right?

483
0:16:6,5 --> 0:16:8,58
So I understand that tendency to argue

484
0:16:8,58 --> 0:16:12,51
To argue with people on Zhihu and Baidu Tieba

485
0:16:12,51 --> 0:16:13,63
What kind of state that is

486
0:16:13,63 --> 0:16:15,11
How about I post it on my Tieba?

487
0:16:15,11 --> 0:16:17,19
How did this episode of Tu Latin 83 come about?

488
0:16:17,19 --> 0:16:17,59
Right?

489
0:16:17,59 --> 0:16:18,55
You must have had an argument with someone.

490
0:16:18,55 --> 0:16:19,25
Right?

491
0:16:19,25 --> 0:16:22,27
So, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter.

492
0:16:22,27 --> 0:16:24,13
But you, Trump,

493
0:16:24,13 --> 0:16:27,5
as the leader of a country,

494
0:16:27,5 --> 0:16:28,27
you also do this?

495
0:16:30,7 --> 0:16:32,77
Musk is with his two NPDs

496
0:16:32,77 --> 0:16:34,35
That would be absolutely terrifying

497
0:16:34,35 --> 0:16:34,98
You know

498
0:16:34,98 --> 0:16:36,42
Two NPDs

499
0:16:36,42 --> 0:16:37,92
It's like a pair of twins

500
0:16:37,92 --> 0:16:39,2
Complementing each other

501
0:16:39,2 --> 0:16:40,47
Validating each other

502
0:16:40,47 --> 0:16:42,63
Constantly flattering each other

503
0:16:42,63 --> 0:16:45,3
And emotionally relying on each other

504
0:16:45,3 --> 0:16:46,91
That's a truly frightening situation

505
0:16:46,91 --> 0:16:50,89
The scariest thing is that humans lack a frame of reference.

506
0:16:50,89 --> 0:16:51,49
You know that, right?

507
0:16:51,49 --> 0:16:53,41
Tang Taizong had Wei Zheng, after all.

508
0:16:53,41 --> 0:16:54,63
So, a lot of the time,

509
0:16:54,63 --> 0:16:55,53
no one tells you

510
0:16:55,53 --> 0:16:57,24
that what you're doing is wrong.

511
0:16:57,24 --> 0:16:58,72
He would tell you

512
0:16:58,72 --> 0:17:0,38
that everything you do is right.

513
0:17:0,38 --> 0:17:2,64
In other words, it's like an emperor and a eunuch.

514
0:17:2,64 --> 0:17:4,4
When two people are together, they say to each other

515
0:17:4,4 --> 0:17:5,72
Oh, Your Majesty, you are truly wise

516
0:17:5,72 --> 0:17:7,48
And the eunuch says to the Emperor, and the eunuch says

517
0:17:7,48 --> 0:17:8,64
Oh, that Zhao Gao

518
0:17:8,64 --> 0:17:10,78
You really understand my thoughts and all

519
0:17:10,78 --> 0:17:11,48
This is a disaster

520
0:17:11,48 --> 0:17:13,46
This can easily lead to the decline of a dynasty

521
0:17:13,46 --> 0:17:15,74
So I think in many cases

522
0:17:15,74 --> 0:17:18,52
We must not, well, how to put it

523
0:17:18,52 --> 0:17:19,84
Wear a frown

524
0:17:19,84 --> 0:17:23,8
But in reality, you need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario

525
0:17:23,8 --> 0:17:24,36
Because a cornered dog will jump over the wall

526
0:17:24,36 --> 0:17:27,7
There are many things that can go wrong

527
0:17:27,7 --> 0:17:28,5
Considering everything

528
0:17:28,5 --> 0:17:31,85
If there’s a process of things turning for the worse

529
0:17:31,85 --> 0:17:34,13
It will definitely turn that way

530
0:17:34,13 --> 0:17:35,49
This is like Moore's Law

531
0:17:35,49 --> 0:17:37,15
So many things aren’t actually governed by Moore's Law

532
0:17:37,15 --> 0:17:39,0
It's Murphy's Law.

533
0:17:39,44 --> 0:17:40,9
So, a lot of the time,

534
0:17:40,9 --> 0:17:42,6
the more you know,

535
0:17:42,6 --> 0:17:44,4
the less happy you might be,

536
0:17:44,4 --> 0:17:45,8
the more you know,

537
0:17:45,8 --> 0:17:46,87
the less likely you are to argue with others.

538
0:17:46,87 --> 0:17:47,55
That's how it is.

539
0:17:47,55 --> 0:17:48,83
But when it comes to politics,

540
0:17:48,83 --> 0:17:50,75
it's best to leave it to the professionals.

541
0:17:50,75 --> 0:17:51,99
Still, I'll say it again

542
0:17:51,99 --> 0:17:54,31
The country is making adjustments to the humanities

543
0:17:54,31 --> 0:17:57,79
Many universities are adjusting their humanities and science departments

544
0:17:57,79 --> 0:17:59,25
I think that's right

545
0:17:59,25 --> 0:18:1,37
Because when it comes to the humanities

546
0:18:1,37 --> 0:18:3,25
It doesn't really help you find a job

547
0:18:3,25 --> 0:18:5,65
It's about cultivating humanistic literacy

548
0:18:5,65 --> 0:18:9,41
It shouldn't be used as a major in college

549
0:18:9,41 --> 0:18:12,79
We're not like in the West where people study humanities and then go to law school

550
0:18:12,79 --> 0:18:13,81
And then enter politics

551
0:18:13,81 --> 0:18:15,21
That's not the same thing

552
0:18:15,21 --> 0:18:15,89
So to say

553
0:18:15,89 --> 0:18:18,55
If you want to contribute to the country

554
0:18:18,55 --> 0:18:19,73
In your twenties and thirties

555
0:18:19,73 --> 0:18:22,51
You should learn things that are easier to find jobs with

556
0:18:22,51 --> 0:18:23,73
Easier to

557
0:18:23,73 --> 0:18:27,45
Engage in social and practical production

558
0:18:27,45 --> 0:18:29,599
More practical things

559
0:18:29,599 --> 0:18:31,899
The humanities, especially history books

560
0:18:31,899 --> 0:18:34,859
You can read them when you're in your thirties and forties

561
0:18:34,859 --> 0:18:37,22
By then, you'll be like me, older

562
0:18:37,22 --> 0:18:38,18
Wiser and more experienced

563
0:18:38,18 --> 0:18:39,26
You'll have seen more

564
0:18:39,26 --> 0:18:41,94
And truly understand why politics works the way it does

565
0:18:41,94 --> 0:18:43,42
Because when you're young, you don't understand

566
0:18:43,42 --> 0:18:46,18
When you're young, you're full of passion

567
0:18:46,18 --> 0:18:46,8
Young

568
0:18:46,8 --> 0:18:49,92
How can this passion ever cool down

569
0:18:49,92 --> 0:18:50,38
Right

570
0:18:50,38 --> 0:18:52,0
How can I be put in the fridge

571
0:18:52,0 --> 0:18:53,18
But after a while

572
0:18:53,18 --> 0:18:53,94
You'll realize

573
0:18:53,94 --> 0:18:55,63
There are certain rules in politics that are correct

574
0:18:55,63 --> 0:18:57,35
Sometimes you can't be merciful

575
0:18:57,35 --> 0:18:59,58
Sometimes you can't talk about morals and righteousness

576
0:18:59,58 --> 0:19:1,38
Sometimes in international relations

577
0:19:1,38 --> 0:19:2,18
Military conflicts

578
0:19:2,18 --> 0:19:3,22
Intelligence battles

579
0:19:3,22 --> 0:19:4,7
All kinds of economic struggles

580
0:19:4,7 --> 0:19:6,6
You have to fight back

581
0:19:6,6 --> 0:19:8,19
Fighting back is sometimes unavoidable

582
0:19:8,19 --> 0:19:9,85
Because once you show mercy

583
0:19:9,85 --> 0:19:10,55
You suffer

584
0:19:10,55 --> 0:19:12,21
Your side will suffer

585
0:19:12,21 --> 0:19:13,59
So in this regard

586
0:19:13,59 --> 0:19:15,79
It's like team battles

587
0:19:15,79 --> 0:19:17,55
Playing competitive games

588
0:19:17,55 --> 0:19:19,31
In ranked matches

589
0:19:19,31 --> 0:19:22,1
You need to have a ruthless heart

590
0:19:22,1 --> 0:19:23,61
So in these matters

591
0:19:23,61 --> 0:19:24,61
It's always the same

592
0:19:24,61 --> 0:19:26,53
An outsider shouldn't guide an expert

593
0:19:26,53 --> 0:19:27,83
Don't be like Trump

594
0:19:27,83 --> 0:19:29,51
We shouldn't be like Trump

595
0:19:29,51 --> 0:19:32,16
Going around pointing out flaws

596
0:19:32,16 --> 0:19:33,2
Rest assured

597
0:19:33,2 --> 0:19:35,7
A country has its most elite people

598
0:19:35,7 --> 0:19:36,82
All working on it

599
0:19:36,82 --> 0:19:38,76
No need to worry about these issues

600
0:19:38,76 --> 0:19:40,54
So in the end

601
0:19:40,54 --> 0:19:42,26
We should focus on ourselves
