1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,2
Then everyone else is just a supporting role

2
0:0:2,2 --> 0:0:3,82
But in everyday life

3
0:0:3,82 --> 0:0:5,32
When I go out for dinner with my female follower

4
0:0:5,32 --> 0:0:7,14
She goes out for dinner with this male actor

5
0:0:7,14 --> 0:0:7,98
Or a male director

6
0:0:7,98 --> 0:0:9,26
This isn't for business

7
0:0:9,26 --> 0:0:10,99
It's perfectly normal

8
0:0:10,99 --> 0:0:13,31
I saw him go to Huixian Yaxu

9
0:0:13,31 --> 0:0:13,81
Right?

10
0:0:13,81 --> 0:0:15,23
There are also symptoms

11
0:0:15,23 --> 0:0:15,87
There are also patients

12
0:0:15,87 --> 0:0:19,89
Isn't this just a given?

13
0:0:19,89 --> 0:0:20,67
Exactly

14
0:0:20,67 --> 0:0:22,72
But we need to broaden our perspective

15
0:0:22,72 --> 0:0:23,74
Let me tell you

16
0:0:23,74 --> 0:0:24,88
People in their twenties

17
0:0:24,88 --> 0:0:27,15
Because your mindset isn't fully developed

18
0:0:27,15 --> 0:0:28,31
Look at me, I'm over 40

19
0:0:28,31 --> 0:0:30,1
I don't care anymore.

20
0:0:30,1 --> 0:0:32,7
Who cares about finding a handsome guy?

21
0:0:32,7 --> 0:0:33,7
It doesn’t matter.

22
0:0:33,7 --> 0:0:35,66
Let it be.

23
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:37,2
No one belongs to anyone.

24
0:0:37,2 --> 0:0:38,98
No one should restrict anyone.

25
0:0:38,98 --> 0:0:41,38
No one should be confined by this.

26
0:0:41,38 --> 0:0:43,58
Since you two aren’t in a marriage.

27
0:0:43,58 --> 0:0:44,92
It doesn’t involve any children.

28
0:0:44,92 --> 0:0:46,6
It doesn't involve property

29
0:0:46,6 --> 0:0:46,7
Got it?

30
0:0:46,7 --> 0:0:48,24
It doesn't involve legal issues

31
0:0:48,24 --> 0:0:49,99
That's it

32
0:0:49,99 --> 0:0:50,179
You can date freely

33
0:0:50,179 --> 0:0:50,899
Be together freely

34
0:0:50,899 --> 0:0:52,339
There are no binding rules between you

35
0:0:52,339 --> 0:0:54,25
That's it

36
0:0:54,37 --> 0:0:56,7
No need to worry about it

37
0:0:56,7 --> 0:0:56,71
Let me tell you

38
0:0:56,71 --> 0:0:58,5
the person who truly cares for you

39
0:0:58,5 --> 0:0:59,77
won't ask you for a hundred male models

40
0:0:59,77 --> 0:1:1,14
and won't do anything out of the ordinary

41
0:1:1,14 --> 0:1:2,46
the person you're thinking about

42
0:1:2,46 --> 0:1:4,12
the one you want to know more about

43
0:1:4,12 --> 0:1:5,94
won't hide things from you for a lifetime

44
0:1:5,94 --> 0:1:7,58
sigh, won't keep secrets from you forever

45
0:1:7,58 --> 0:1:11,93
you wouldn't know how to deceive someone who doesn't want to deceive you

46
0:1:11,93 --> 0:1:12,77
You give him a chance

47
0:1:12,77 --> 0:1:14,61
he wouldn't think of deceiving you like that

48
0:1:14,61 --> 0:1:16,11
You wouldn't hide it from you for a lifetime

49
0:1:16,11 --> 0:1:17,69
or keep you in the dark

50
0:1:17,69 --> 0:1:18,77
or keep it a secret from you

51
0:1:18,77 --> 0:1:19,11
Oh

52
0:1:19,11 --> 0:1:21,9
or keep anything from you

53
0:1:21,9 --> 0:1:23,54
I don't really care about my cat

54
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:24,1
it's not mine anyway

55
0:1:24,1 --> 0:1:25,78
Which one of these nine cats is mine?

56
0:1:25,78 --> 0:1:27,8
You see, my goodness!

57
0:1:27,8 --> 0:1:28,2
I can't take it anymore.

58
0:1:28,2 --> 0:1:29,889
I feel so terrible.

59
0:1:29,889 --> 0:1:31,89
Is that how they were born?

60
0:1:31,89 --> 0:1:32,509
Aren't they all born from mother cats?

61
0:1:32,509 --> 0:1:33,49
Right?

62
0:1:33,49 --> 0:1:35,229
These nine kittens are all the closest to me, right?

63
0:1:35,229 --> 0:1:35,83
Isn't that so?

64
0:1:35,83 --> 0:1:36,57
So what?

65
0:1:36,57 --> 0:1:36,95
Right?

66
0:1:36,95 --> 0:1:37,75
Is that it?

67
0:1:37,75 --> 0:1:39,82
Don't overthink it.

68
0:1:39,82 --> 0:1:40,16
Oh!

69
0:1:40,16 --> 0:1:44,32
You can really give birth to Mother Nature and all that?

70
0:1:44,32 --> 0:1:47,3
We're just passersby.

71
0:1:47,3 --> 0:1:48,71
We're just passersby.

72
0:1:48,71 --> 0:1:50,59
You only have the right to use it.

73
0:1:50,59 --> 0:1:51,95
You don't have the ownership.

74
0:1:51,95 --> 0:1:53,95
His parents don't have the ownership either.

75
0:1:53,95 --> 0:1:55,91
The ownership lies with the heavens.

76
0:1:55,91 --> 0:1:58,43
When the heavens decide to take it, it's taken.

77
0:1:58,43 --> 0:1:59,759
He doesn't even have the right himself.

78
0:1:59,759 --> 0:2:0,659
I said, eh.

79
0:2:0,659 --> 0:2:1,839
I said, are you being formal today?

80
0:2:1,839 --> 0:2:2,999
The heavens say it's not your turn yet.

81
0:2:2,999 --> 0:2:3,479
Not eh.

82
0:2:3,479 --> 0:2:4,199
You mean it's just like that

83
0:2:4,199 --> 0:2:6,319
So, this thing, once you figure it out

84
0:2:6,319 --> 0:2:7,399
No one owns anyone

85
0:2:7,399 --> 0:2:9,41
No one should own anyone

86
0:2:9,41 --> 0:2:11,25
No one should dominate anyone

87
0:2:11,25 --> 0:2:12,93
No one should dictate to anyone

88
0:2:12,93 --> 0:2:15,1
If someone is charming, they spread their charm around

89
0:2:15,1 --> 0:2:15,69
It's just perfect

90
0:2:15,69 --> 0:2:18,5
This is for the survival and continuation of human society

91
0:2:18,5 --> 0:2:19,91
For the better development of future generations

92
0:2:19,91 --> 0:2:21,48
This is also a natural human inclination

93
0:2:21,48 --> 0:2:23,12
To be higher, faster, and stronger, right?

94
0:2:23,12 --> 0:2:23,62
It's quite normal

95
0:2:23,62 --> 0:2:24,86
I'm getting old

96
0:2:24,86 --> 0:2:26,56
Others might want something younger

97
0:2:26,56 --> 0:2:28,46
What's wrong?

98
0:2:28,46 --> 0:2:29,62
From my perspective

99
0:2:29,62 --> 0:2:31,2
Oh, you betrayed me

100
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:32,5
From a natural perspective

101
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:33,6
quality birth and upbringing

102
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:35,649
shouldn't it be like this

103
0:2:35,649 --> 0:2:37,69
shouldn't this be encouraged

104
0:2:37,69 --> 0:2:38,649
you just pretend you don't know and that's it

105
0:2:38,649 --> 0:2:39,969
do they still care about you

106
0:2:39,969 --> 0:2:41,9
they don't tell you, right

107
0:2:41,9 --> 0:2:42,369
I'll keep it from you in the future, won't that be fine

108
0:2:42,369 --> 0:2:42,869
that's how it is

109
0:2:42,869 --> 0:2:44,31
You need to see it clearly.

110
0:2:44,31 --> 0:2:45,35
That's how it is.

111
0:2:45,35 --> 0:2:47,7
Don't take yourself too seriously.

112
0:2:47,7 --> 0:2:49,75
I'm not joking around with you guys.

113
0:2:49,75 --> 0:2:50,69
We are telling you,

114
0:2:50,69 --> 0:2:52,61
As you get older,

115
0:2:52,61 --> 0:2:55,95
When your looks can no longer rule the world,

116
0:2:55,95 --> 0:2:57,45
In many situations,

117
0:2:57,45 --> 0:3:0,2
It's impossible to be the protagonist of someone else's story.

118
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:2,1
How should you adjust your mindset?

119
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:4,56
You should take things as they come.

120
0:3:4,92 --> 0:3:6,46
Take things as they come.

121
0:3:6,46 --> 0:3:7,48
Do whatever you want.

122
0:3:7,48 --> 0:3:8,66
Don’t bother me while I’m ascending to immortality.

123
0:3:8,66 --> 0:3:10,0
I’m working on my own path.

124
0:3:10,0 --> 0:3:11,38
It’s not related to anyone else.

125
0:3:11,38 --> 0:3:12,82
You need to have this kind of mindset.

126
0:3:12,82 --> 0:3:16,419
Don’t let gains and losses get you down.

127
0:3:16,419 --> 0:3:18,379
Oh, worrying too much

128
0:3:18,379 --> 0:3:19,519
Worrying too much

129
0:3:19,519 --> 0:3:21,41
Hey, why did you go out drinking?

130
0:3:21,41 --> 0:3:23,61
Hey, why did you come home so late?

131
0:3:23,61 --> 0:3:24,19
No way

132
0:3:24,19 --> 0:3:25,4
I have to manage your money

133
0:3:25,4 --> 0:3:25,96
No way

134
0:3:25,96 --> 0:3:27,0
I have to keep an eye on you

135
0:3:27,0 --> 0:3:28,58
I need to back up your phone

136
0:3:28,58 --> 0:3:29,88
I need to have a tracker

137
0:3:29,88 --> 0:3:31,4
I need to install a GPS in your car

138
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:32,32
Are you tired?

139
0:3:32,32 --> 0:3:34,24
Buddy, are you tired?

140
0:3:34,24 --> 0:3:35,26
Is life tiring?

141
0:3:35,26 --> 0:3:36,38
Are you tired?

142
0:3:36,38 --> 0:3:37,92
Do you think you're tired?

143
0:3:37,92 --> 0:3:39,52
It's just that thing, isn't it?

144
0:3:39,52 --> 0:3:41,28
It's just a small matter, isn't it?

145
0:3:41,28 --> 0:3:41,7
Really?
