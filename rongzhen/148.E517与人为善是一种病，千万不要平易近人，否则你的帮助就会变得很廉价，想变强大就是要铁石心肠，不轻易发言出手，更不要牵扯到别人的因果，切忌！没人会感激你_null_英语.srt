0:0:0,34 --> 0:0:1,5
Hi, everyone!

2
0:0:1,5 --> 0:0:3,77
Welcome to another episode of our chat.

3
0:0:3,77 --> 0:0:5,61
What shall we talk about today?

4
0:0:5,61 --> 0:0:8,43
We'll discuss a fundamental principle of being a good person.

5
0:0:8,43 --> 0:0:10,84
Many people don't understand what principles there are to being a good person.

6
0:0:10,84 --> 0:0:12,88
Actually, there is a basic principle to being a good person.

7
0:0:12,88 --> 0:0:14,54
And that principle is not to be too nice.

8
0:0:14,54 --> 0:0:16,52
Why shouldn't you be too nice?

9
0:0:16,52 --> 0:0:18,63
Let me explain it to you in detail.

10
0:0:18,63 --> 0:0:19,75
First, let's talk about this.

11
0:0:19,75 --> 0:0:21,43
The term 'good person' is used with quotation marks.

12
0:0:21,43 --> 0:0:24,7
Being a good person doesn't mean you have to do good deeds all the time.

13
0:0:24,7 --> 0:0:25,71
It's not about not being a kind person,

14
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:28,55
but rather, you shouldn't be too easy to please.

15
0:0:28,55 --> 0:0:30,1
Someone who is overly generous and kind,

16
0:0:30,1 --> 0:0:31,7
and very approachable.

17
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:33,24
Recently, a few younger guys,

18
0:0:33,24 --> 0:0:36,96
got thoroughly scolded by my four consecutive posts on social media today.

19
0:0:36,96 --> 0:0:38,84
Actually, they are all my loyal fans.

20
0:0:38,84 --> 0:0:39,88
They are all pretty great.

21
0:0:39,88 --> 0:0:42,14
After the young guy added me on WeChat,

22
0:0:42,14 --> 0:0:43,2
he was really happy.

23
0:0:43,2 --> 0:0:45,1
He’s willing to share anything with me.

24
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:49,64
Then I quickly went off on a rant in my Moments.

25
0:0:49,64 --> 0:0:50,5
Why is that?

26
0:0:50,5 --> 0:0:51,4
Let me tell you,

27
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:55,8
First off, I have around 17,000 WeChat friends.

28
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:57,88
Every day, countless people ask me all sorts of questions.

29
0:0:57,88 --> 0:0:59,2
So when I'm consulting,

30
0:0:59,2 --> 0:1:0,849
I set a threshold,

31
0:1:0,849 --> 0:1:1,769
you pay,

32
0:1:1,769 --> 0:1:3,38
and you can ask me some questions.

33
0:1:3,38 --> 0:1:4,42
If you don't pay,

34
0:1:4,42 --> 0:1:5,9
I won't even bother to respond.

35
0:1:5,9 --> 0:1:7,16
Why do I have to do it this way?

36
0:1:7,16 --> 0:1:7,86
Then they mention Brother Rong

37
0:1:7,86 --> 0:1:8,7
Are you short on money?

38
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:10,24
You're referring to that, right?

39
0:1:10,24 --> 0:1:11,6
It's about being short on money.

40
0:1:11,6 --> 0:1:13,16
But this is also a strategic issue.

41
0:1:13,16 --> 0:1:16,55
Why can't you be equally kind to everyone?

42
0:1:16,55 --> 0:1:19,29
Why can't you be generous to everyone?

43
0:1:19,29 --> 0:1:22,56
It's because humans are very complex creatures.

44
0:1:22,56 --> 0:1:24,2
It's not that you're good to others,

45
0:1:24,2 --> 0:1:25,42
that they will definitely be good to you.

46
0:1:25,42 --> 0:1:28,29
Or most of the time, when you're good to others,

47
0:1:28,29 --> 0:1:29,81
they will be grateful to you.

48
0:1:29,81 --> 0:1:31,13
But they won't do anything

49
0:1:31,13 --> 0:1:34,39
that actually benefits you.

50
0:1:34,39 --> 0:1:35,239
Over time,

51
0:1:35,239 --> 0:1:36,439
your kindness

52
0:1:36,439 --> 0:1:39,199
will be perceived as cheap.

53
0:1:39,199 --> 0:1:40,259
So in this sense,

54
0:1:40,259 --> 0:1:43,43
you'll end up feeling very drained.

55
0:1:43,43 --> 0:1:45,3
If I were to attend to everyone

56
0:1:45,3 --> 0:1:47,5
everyone would get involved in their personal karmic cycle

57
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:48,99
offering all sorts of advice

58
0:1:48,99 --> 0:1:50,25
without charging a fee

59
0:1:50,25 --> 0:1:52,57
then I would be exposed to these situations

60
0:1:52,57 --> 0:1:55,12
and be weighed down by these people's karmic issues every day

61
0:1:55,12 --> 0:1:56,68
the more advice I give

62
0:1:56,68 --> 0:1:58,76
the more I get involved in their relationships

63
0:1:58,76 --> 0:2:0,24
the more I get entangled in their lives

64
0:2:0,24 --> 0:2:2,76
My final personal fate and fortune

65
0:2:2,76 --> 0:2:5,46
various daily routines would be significantly disrupted

66
0:2:5,46 --> 0:2:9,1
so when some people start asking me all sorts of questions

67
0:2:9,1 --> 0:2:10,8
I give them a stern warning

68
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:12,63
don't really treat me like a godfather

69
0:2:12,63 --> 0:2:15,19
you need to understand that we are two equal individuals

70
0:2:15,19 --> 0:2:16,65
if you like what I do

71
0:2:16,65 --> 0:2:18,89
then please be an independent and self-reliant person

72
0:2:18,89 --> 0:2:20,82
this is a crucial matter

73
0:2:20,82 --> 0:2:22,12
I have a friend recently

74
0:2:22,12 --> 0:2:24,83
who is a PhD from a certain university

75
0:2:24,83 --> 0:2:25,99
a PhD in psychology

76
0:2:25,99 --> 0:2:27,91
and he also works as a mediator

77
0:2:27,91 --> 0:2:29,31
but in this role

78
0:2:29,31 --> 0:2:32,459
he worked as a counselor for about a month

79
0:2:32,459 --> 0:2:33,539
and then he quit

80
0:2:33,539 --> 0:2:36,879
because he is a typical example among my friends

81
0:2:36,879 --> 0:2:38,159
of someone with a people-pleasing personality

82
0:2:38,159 --> 0:2:42,329
Why would someone with a people-pleasing personality study psychology?

83
0:2:42,329 --> 0:2:45,649
They themselves have a bit of a need in this area.

84
0:2:45,649 --> 0:2:48,42
They might feel somewhat abnormal in certain aspects.

85
0:2:48,42 --> 0:2:50,34
But many kind children

86
0:2:50,34 --> 0:2:52,24
hope for a world filled with fairness,

87
0:2:52,24 --> 0:2:53,26
filled with love,

88
0:2:53,26 --> 0:2:55,54
and filled with all sorts of harmonious things.

89
0:2:55,54 --> 0:2:57,66
I also hope the world is full of love.

90
0:2:57,66 --> 0:2:59,96
Otherwise, some of my actions would be hard to explain.

91
0:2:59,96 --> 0:3:2,52
But you still need to live strategically to make this world full of love.

92
0:3:2,52 --> 0:3:4,42
You still need to live strategically.

93
0:3:4,42 --> 0:3:6,7
If you can't live strategically,

94
0:3:6,7 --> 0:3:8,2
without thinking,

95
0:3:8,2 --> 0:3:9,94
without some strategic goals,

96
0:3:9,94 --> 0:3:13,9
you'll end up being weighed down by the values of being a good person.

97
0:3:13,9 --> 0:3:16,4
For many people in making friends,

98
0:3:16,4 --> 0:3:17,4
in pursuing a career,

99
0:3:17,4 --> 0:3:18,8
in being a person,

100
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:21,2
Often in a state of being exploited

101
0:3:21,2 --> 0:3:21,64
being used

102
0:3:21,64 --> 0:3:23,18
being controlled

103
0:3:23,18 --> 0:3:27,22
So sometimes being a pushover doesn’t work

104
0:3:27,22 --> 0:3:29,1
That is to say, any of your actions

105
0:3:29,1 --> 0:3:32,579
any of your acts of helping others shouldn’t be devalued

106
0:3:32,579 --> 0:3:35,179
There must be equivalent benefits in exchange

107
0:3:35,179 --> 0:3:37,4
You can help others

108
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:38,2
But when you help others

109
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:39,36
If you don't ask for a penny

110
0:3:39,36 --> 0:3:41,52
people might not really appreciate it

111
0:3:41,52 --> 0:3:43,23
nor would they really do anything about it

112
0:3:43,23 --> 0:3:45,37
perhaps half of them would be grateful

113
0:3:45,37 --> 0:3:47,1
and your relationship with them would gradually improve

114
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:48,19
but consider this person

115
0:3:48,19 --> 0:3:51,63
who takes up so much of your social space

116
0:3:51,63 --> 0:3:54,51
what kind of real connection would you have with them

117
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:56,37
it would just waste your time

118
0:3:56,37 --> 0:3:59,13
So, whether from the perspective of time dilution,

119
0:3:59,13 --> 0:4:1,17
or from the aspect of benefit exchange,

120
0:4:1,17 --> 0:4:3,79
you can't help others for free.

121
0:4:3,79 --> 0:4:4,179
No matter what,

122
0:4:4,179 --> 0:4:6,939
even if you charge someone 20 yuan, you should still do it.

123
0:4:6,939 --> 0:4:9,13
This is a fundamental issue of values.

124
0:4:9,13 --> 0:4:11,1
That is to say, in our daily lives,

125
0:4:11,1 --> 0:4:13,17
all your interactions with others,

126
0:4:13,17 --> 0:4:15,53
should not devalue your actions.

127
0:4:15,53 --> 0:4:19,21
If you're helping others out of various obligations,

128
0:4:19,21 --> 0:4:20,41
or out of kindness,

129
0:4:20,41 --> 0:4:21,239
when you assist someone,

130
0:4:21,239 --> 0:4:22,799
whether you're helping a woman,

131
0:4:22,799 --> 0:4:23,679
or a man,

132
0:4:23,679 --> 0:4:24,819
basically helping someone of the opposite sex,

133
0:4:24,819 --> 0:4:26,12
or even helping your parents,

134
0:4:26,12 --> 0:4:27,88
or anyone in need,

135
0:4:27,88 --> 0:4:29,4
remember the help you offer

136
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:29,8
First, it shouldn't be cheap

137
0:4:29,8 --> 0:4:30,74
It shouldn't be free

138
0:4:30,74 --> 0:4:32,8
It shouldn't be voluntary on your part

139
0:4:32,8 --> 0:4:33,64
As long as the other party proposes it

140
0:4:33,64 --> 0:4:34,86
The other party needs you

141
0:4:34,86 --> 0:4:36,12
They genuinely need you

142
0:4:36,12 --> 0:4:38,12
And they are unwilling to spend money on something like this

143
0:4:38,12 --> 0:4:39,13
This is the right approach

144
0:4:39,13 --> 0:4:43,549
Because if the other party thinks your actions aren't worth spending money on

145
0:4:43,549 --> 0:4:45,689
That just shows your actions are cheap

146
0:4:45,689 --> 0:4:48,29
or that he's quite stingy

147
0:4:48,29 --> 0:4:50,7
so this matter isn't worth your help

148
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:53,12
Of course, when it comes to making friends, it shouldn't be about such tactics

149
0:4:53,12 --> 0:4:53,9
Speaking of making friends

150
0:4:53,9 --> 0:4:56,36
it starts with mutual gestures of goodwill, a form of reciprocal benefit

151
0:4:56,36 --> 0:4:58,44
but you'll find that many people in this world make friends

152
0:4:58,44 --> 0:5:0,28
solely for the purpose of exchanging benefits

153
0:5:0,28 --> 0:5:1,76
seeing them as mere tools for their own gain

154
0:5:1,76 --> 0:5:3,4
But how does he put it?

155
0:5:3,4 --> 0:5:4,8
From his perspective,

156
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:6,64
you are merely a tool to be used.

157
0:5:6,64 --> 0:5:10,16
You are just a resource manager, someone who controls resources.

158
0:5:10,16 --> 0:5:11,72
So, in this world,

159
0:5:11,72 --> 0:5:15,21
in our human society, most of the time,

160
0:5:15,21 --> 0:5:17,71
you can maintain a childlike heart.

161
0:5:17,71 --> 0:5:18,75
But let me tell you,

162
0:5:18,75 --> 0:5:21,5
a childlike heart is only for children.

163
0:5:21,5 --> 0:5:22,71
And it's particularly young children.

164
0:5:22,71 --> 0:5:24,17
By the time the child is eight or nine years old,

165
0:5:24,17 --> 0:5:25,45
At eleven or twelve years old,

166
0:5:25,45 --> 0:5:26,17
Thirteen or fourteen years old,

167
0:5:26,17 --> 0:5:28,28
They start to develop a sense of social awareness.

168
0:5:28,28 --> 0:5:30,88
You can be a bit nicer to those who are genuinely good.

169
0:5:30,88 --> 0:5:33,84
But if you are overly nice to those who are genuinely good,

170
0:5:33,84 --> 0:5:36,24
Without any protective shell against social threats,

171
0:5:36,24 --> 0:5:37,18
They will also be in trouble.

172
0:5:37,18 --> 0:5:40,97
So a truly good person should have pure intentions

173
0:5:40,97 --> 0:5:43,1
with decisive actions

174
0:5:43,1 --> 0:5:44,42
fierce as an angry Vajra

175
0:5:44,42 --> 0:5:45,26
compassionate like a Bodhisattva

176
0:5:45,26 --> 0:5:46,62
both qualities are essential

177
0:5:46,62 --> 0:5:48,2
if you only have the compassion of a Bodhisattva

178
0:5:48,2 --> 0:5:49,7
then to outsiders

179
0:5:49,7 --> 0:5:53,38
many would see you as someone they can easily manipulate

180
0:5:53,38 --> 0:5:54,76
to put it bluntly

181
0:5:54,76 --> 0:5:56,24
Just a casual object

182
0:5:56,24 --> 0:5:58,3
Guys can be casually exploited for gold coins

183
0:5:58,3 --> 0:6:0,8
What kind of girls can be casually taken advantage of

184
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:2,48
Just a casual object

185
0:6:2,48 --> 0:6:3,68
An object that can be casually ordered around

186
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:4,8
You're pretty nice to people

187
0:6:4,8 --> 0:6:6,44
But whether you're nice to people

188
0:6:7,56 --> 0:6:9,44
Depends on your youth

189
0:6:9,44 --> 0:6:10,64
Your family during your teenage years

190
0:6:10,64 --> 0:6:11,97
Regarding your education

191
0:6:11,97 --> 0:6:13,65
How you should face society

192
0:6:13,65 --> 0:6:14,93
Being kind to others and such

193
0:6:14,93 --> 0:6:15,669
But remember

194
0:6:15,669 --> 0:6:18,49
To protect the goodness in your heart

195
0:6:18,49 --> 0:6:19,869
Your shell needs to be tough

196
0:6:19,869 --> 0:6:20,829
Like a hedgehog

197
0:6:20,829 --> 0:6:22,329
A tough exterior

198
0:6:22,329 --> 0:6:24,15
And a soft interior is enough

199
0:6:25,97 --> 0:6:26,95
when doing good deeds

200
0:6:26,95 --> 0:6:29,79
for those who truly have no ability to defend themselves

201
0:6:29,79 --> 0:6:31,43
when performing genuinely good actions

202
0:6:31,43 --> 0:6:32,419
you can go ahead and do it

203
0:6:32,419 --> 0:6:34,199
but when it comes to helping an elderly lady

204
0:6:34,199 --> 0:6:35,99
or an elderly man

205
0:6:35,99 --> 0:6:37,6
you need to understand strategically

206
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:39,72
because these people may not necessarily be worthy of your help

207
0:6:39,72 --> 0:6:41,42
Some people might turn the tables on you

208
0:6:41,42 --> 0:6:42,86
Often, that's how it goes

209
0:6:42,86 --> 0:6:45,78
When you face the world with a kind heart

210
0:6:45,78 --> 0:6:47,5
The world can be full of malice

211
0:6:47,5 --> 0:6:49,39
But good and bad are equally present

212
0:6:49,39 --> 0:6:51,15
Treat good people better and better

213
0:6:51,15 --> 0:6:52,73
Treat bad people worse and worse

214
0:6:52,73 --> 0:6:55,9
Otherwise, you'll just be seen as a resource by others

215
0:6:55,9 --> 0:6:56,11
A herbivore

216
0:6:56,11 --> 0:6:56,86
Do you understand?

217
0:6:56,86 --> 0:6:58,1
So I'm teaching you

218
0:6:58,1 --> 0:7:1,4
this set of principles and behaviors for life

219
0:7:1,4 --> 0:7:2,26
most importantly

220
0:7:2,26 --> 0:7:4,62
to understand what the core of Machiavellianism is

221
0:7:4,62 --> 0:7:5,87
it's not egoism

222
0:7:5,87 --> 0:7:10,9
but rather strategically dealing with all kinds of treacherous situations in the world

223
0:7:10,9 --> 0:7:13,1
the intelligence in politics, the military conflicts

224
0:7:13,1 --> 0:7:14,95
and the power struggles

225
0:7:14,95 --> 0:7:17,53
All of these require your strategic thinking.

226
0:7:17,53 --> 0:7:18,33
When you need to deceive, do it.

227
0:7:18,33 --> 0:7:19,3
When you need to bluff, go for it.

228
0:7:19,3 --> 0:7:21,3
If you need to play a trick, then play it.

229
0:7:21,3 --> 0:7:23,26
Because that's how it is between nations.

230
0:7:23,26 --> 0:7:26,75
However, Machiavellianism is more often used in political arenas.

231
0:7:26,75 --> 0:7:30,34
Business battles are not fought in personal relationships.

232
0:7:30,34 --> 0:7:31,54
In personal relationships,

233
0:7:31,54 --> 0:7:33,9
if you always treat everything as a trade-off,

234
0:7:33,9 --> 0:7:35,28
You can't get true friends

235
0:7:35,28 --> 0:7:36,94
Sometimes, in a friendship

236
0:7:36,94 --> 0:7:39,59
You need to receive some genuine responses

237
0:7:39,59 --> 0:7:40,43
But let me tell you

238
0:7:40,43 --> 0:7:42,11
Making friends also requires a strategic approach

239
0:7:42,11 --> 0:7:44,3
If the other person has no resources

240
0:7:44,3 --> 0:7:46,48
If the other person is just an ordinary individual

241
0:7:46,48 --> 0:7:47,7
Then you have to see how things develop

242
0:7:47,7 --> 0:7:48,84
If it’s a couple of years

243
0:7:48,84 --> 0:7:51,22
Within 45 years, a very remarkable person grew up.

244
0:7:51,22 --> 0:7:52,88
He might not even repay you.

245
0:7:52,88 --> 0:7:53,94
So instead of that,

246
0:7:53,94 --> 0:7:57,8
it's better to directly befriend someone who already has resources.

247
0:7:57,8 --> 0:7:59,27
That's how people often are.

248
0:7:59,27 --> 0:8:0,71
If you say it's completely about no interests,

249
0:8:0,71 --> 0:8:1,89
it's impossible when it comes to exchanges.

250
0:8:1,89 --> 0:8:3,51
Otherwise, when someone gets old, they will have

251
0:8:3,51 --> 0:8:4,67
people frequently coming to visit them.

252
0:8:4,67 --> 0:8:6,11
But when it comes to a lifetime

253
0:8:6,11 --> 0:8:7,15
are you living for your friends?

254
0:8:7,15 --> 0:8:8,34
or for your career?

255
0:8:8,34 --> 0:8:9,38
or for love?

256
0:8:9,38 --> 0:8:10,88
You need to make your own choices.

257
0:8:10,88 --> 0:8:13,24
Because you only have so much to give.

258
0:8:13,24 --> 0:8:14,76
If your efforts are scattered,

259
0:8:14,76 --> 0:8:16,79
they become cheapened.

260
0:8:16,79 --> 0:8:19,51
And you should trust the people around me.

261
0:8:19,51 --> 0:8:20,99
Especially female influencers

262
0:8:20,99 --> 0:8:23,27
Especially those who are good at making friends

263
0:8:23,27 --> 0:8:24,659
They have quite a few friends

264
0:8:24,659 --> 0:8:26,379
If you try to pursue a female influencer

265
0:8:26,379 --> 0:8:29,439
It's different from pursuing someone who has many friends

266
0:8:29,439 --> 0:8:32,64
It's really hard to get close to someone who boasts about having many friends

267
0:8:32,64 --> 0:8:34,6
That's incredibly difficult

268
0:8:34,6 --> 0:8:36,63
I particularly dislike people with too many friends

269
0:8:36,63 --> 0:8:37,95
I have a lot of friends too

270
0:8:37,95 --> 0:8:39,89
But I don’t really get along well with anyone.

271
0:8:39,89 --> 0:8:41,45
That’s just the kind of relationship I have.

272
0:8:41,45 --> 0:8:43,49
When I need someone’s help,

273
0:8:43,49 --> 0:8:45,29
I’ll quickly warm up to them.

274
0:8:45,29 --> 0:8:47,5
But when I no longer need that person,

275
0:8:47,5 --> 0:8:48,89
I will definitely cut ties with them.

276
0:8:48,89 --> 0:8:50,73
Because I believe that, to me,

277
0:8:50,73 --> 0:8:52,57
everyone is a burden and a hindrance.

278
0:8:52,57 --> 0:8:53,59
Except for family, of course.

279
0:8:53,59 --> 0:8:54,89
Even loved ones can be foolish at times

280
0:8:54,89 --> 0:8:56,69
And their foolishness can affect me too

281
0:8:56,69 --> 0:8:59,9
So I often tend to be very cautious and introspective

282
0:8:59,9 --> 0:9:2,61
For historically, solitary rulers have always been like this

283
0:9:2,61 --> 0:9:3,69
As an ENTJ

284
0:9:3,69 --> 0:9:4,53
As someone with a strong and commanding personality

285
0:9:4,53 --> 0:9:6,13
You have to accept this loneliness

286
0:9:6,13 --> 0:9:8,97
Because you look down on ordinary people

287
0:9:8,97 --> 0:9:11,29
You find it hard to tolerate ordinary people

288
0:9:11,29 --> 0:9:12,21
Intolerable

289
0:9:12,21 --> 0:9:13,61
You'll find it incredibly annoying

290
0:9:13,61 --> 0:9:17,33
So this world offers you a unique perspective

291
0:9:17,33 --> 0:9:19,3
It gives you a more personal touch with the pen

292
0:9:19,3 --> 0:9:20,54
It almost feels like an NPD

293
0:9:20,54 --> 0:9:20,86
Right?

294
0:9:20,86 --> 0:9:24,13
But we don't leech off others' hard work

295
0:9:24,13 --> 0:9:25,49
We keep our distance

296
0:9:25,49 --> 0:9:27,17
Maintaining a certain distance from everyone

297
0:9:27,17 --> 0:9:29,17
To prevent others' foolishness from hurting us

298
0:9:29,17 --> 0:9:32,2
But more often, it also presents a cold front to others

299
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:34,5
Because your time is precious

300
0:9:34,5 --> 0:9:35,74
I've added so many friends

301
0:9:35,74 --> 0:9:37,4
If I added all 660,000 of my

302
0:9:37,4 --> 0:9:39,88
669,000 followers on WeChat

303
0:9:39,88 --> 0:9:41,88
I wouldn't have any time for myself every day

304
0:9:41,88 --> 0:9:43,69
So many times, you have to be tough

305
0:9:43,69 --> 0:9:46,33
Making choices is the first principle of being a person

306
0:9:46,33 --> 0:9:47,49
And more often than not

307
0:9:47,49 --> 0:9:49,1
If you're not tough enough

308
0:9:49,1 --> 0:9:50,1
Your actions

309
0:9:50,1 --> 0:9:51,55
Your career will suffer

310
0:9:51,55 --> 0:9:54,69
So have you given a lot of your time to

311
0:9:54,69 --> 0:9:55,97
The wrong people

312
0:9:55,97 --> 0:9:59,2
Have you invested a lot of your youth in

313
0:9:59,2 --> 0:10:1,26
People who don't deserve such dedication?

314
0:10:1,26 --> 0:10:3,7
Have you been giving too much?

315
0:10:3,7 --> 0:10:5,42
By giving so much to others

316
0:10:5,42 --> 0:10:7,4
You have less time for yourself

317
0:10:7,4 --> 0:10:9,14
Less time to develop your career

318
0:10:9,14 --> 0:10:11,32
Less time to cultivate your true abilities

319
0:10:11,32 --> 0:10:12,62
So don't be love-struck

320
0:10:12,62 --> 0:10:15,12
Don't be overly kind and helpful

321
0:10:15,12 --> 0:10:16,6
There needs to be a limit
