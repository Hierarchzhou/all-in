0:0:0,18 --> 0:0:0,74
Hello everyone

2
0:0:0,74 --> 0:0:2,18
This is episode 516 of Mattress

3
0:0:2,18 --> 0:0:5,14
I recorded this one while I was tipsy

4
0:0:5,14 --> 0:0:6,18
Why was I tipsy?

5
0:0:6,18 --> 0:0:10,15
Because I recently went out to dinner with some friends

6
0:0:10,15 --> 0:0:13,63
This is Crazy Thursday, buy one get one free

7
0:0:13,63 --> 0:0:15,9
Hehe

8
0:0:15,9 --> 0:0:17,9
Actually, I think recording at this moment is pretty great

9
0:0:17,9 --> 0:0:19,85
In this episode, I'll talk about a very simple example

10
0:0:19,85 --> 0:0:22,43
I really don't understand this kind of behavior from parents in Haidian.

11
0:0:22,43 --> 0:0:24,165
This tiger parenting approach.

12
0:0:24,17 --> 0:0:27,77
I think tiger parenting is a last resort.

13
0:0:27,77 --> 0:0:30,91
When they realize they can't push themselves, they start pushing their kids.

14
0:0:30,91 --> 0:0:34,21
Generally speaking, I feel that by coming to Haidian District,

15
0:0:34,21 --> 0:0:37,93
I've gained access to such a high-level educational environment.

16
0:0:37,93 --> 0:0:40,13
Why wouldn't my child study hard?

17
0:0:40,13 --> 0:0:42,79
But the resources and environment are one thing,

18
0:0:42,79 --> 0:0:45,95
What matters most is what kind of seed this is.

19
0:0:45,95 --> 0:0:48,15
As a medical student,

20
0:0:48,15 --> 0:0:50,47
you have achieved very high academic performance.

21
0:0:50,47 --> 0:0:54,23
Logically, the second generation should achieve even higher grades,

22
0:0:54,23 --> 0:0:55,43
but the probability of that is not high.

23
0:0:55,43 --> 0:0:58,84
Considering you are the pinnacle of intelligence in your family,

24
0:0:58,84 --> 0:1:0,94
from a genetic perspective,

25
0:1:0,94 --> 0:1:3,14
the next generation tends to regress to the mean.

26
0:1:3,14 --> 0:1:5,82
So, the likelihood of your offspring having outstanding academic performance

27
0:1:5,82 --> 0:1:7,3
is not high.

28
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:8,62
And to be honest

29
0:1:8,62 --> 0:1:11,16
when it comes to my friends around me

30
0:1:11,16 --> 0:1:13,78
they often wonder how to properly raise their children

31
0:1:13,78 --> 0:1:14,94
they really don’t know

32
0:1:14,94 --> 0:1:16,66
the cultivation of some key skills

33
0:1:16,66 --> 0:1:18,6
doesn’t take up much of her time

34
0:1:18,6 --> 0:1:22,44
You're like my sister, taking the kids to learn taekwondo.

35
0:1:22,44 --> 0:1:23,4
to learn English

36
0:1:23,4 --> 0:1:24,24
to learn math

37
0:1:24,24 --> 0:1:24,94
Going to learn an instrument

38
0:1:24,94 --> 0:1:26,3
I think it's all useless

39
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:28,58
Because if the child doesn't love learning

40
0:1:28,58 --> 0:1:30,94
taking them to practice this

41
0:1:30,94 --> 0:1:31,98
or sports activities

42
0:1:31,98 --> 0:1:33,2
or artistic activities

43
0:1:33,2 --> 0:1:33,98
or cultural activities

44
0:1:33,98 --> 0:1:35,16
is actually not effective

45
0:1:35,16 --> 0:1:38,28
the most important thing is that the child is interested in something

46
0:1:38,28 --> 0:1:40,34
And I think a child

47
0:1:40,34 --> 0:1:41,3
around six to nine years old

48
0:1:41,3 --> 0:1:46,3
won't show their specific talents before the age of ten

49
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:49,27
a person truly reveals their talents around fourteen or fifteen

50
0:1:49,27 --> 0:1:50,29
sixteen or seventeen

51
0:1:50,29 --> 0:1:51,65
eighteen or nineteen

52
0:1:51,65 --> 0:1:53,77
even then, it might still be a bit early

53
0:1:53,77 --> 0:1:55,7
I've always been telling everyone

54
0:1:55,7 --> 0:1:56,9
this is about English education

55
0:1:56,9 --> 0:1:57,53
It shouldn't be done before the age of 12.

56
0:1:57,53 --> 0:1:58,949
Because before the age of 12,

57
0:1:58,949 --> 0:2:1,829
you don't have a good grasp of cultural elements,

58
0:2:1,829 --> 0:2:4,8
especially the Chinese language environment,

59
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:5,44
subject-verb-

60
0:2:5,44 --> 0:2:6,18
subject-verb-object,

61
0:2:6,18 --> 0:2:9,639
and things like attributive, adverbial, and complement are not fully understood by you.

62
0:2:9,639 --> 0:2:13,48
So, you need to have a good understanding of your modern language.

63
0:2:13,48 --> 0:2:16,32
I think the reason many people struggle in a short period of time is

64
0:2:16,32 --> 0:2:20,78
It's quite simple, from a very early age, there was a focus on nurturing the child.

65
0:2:20,78 --> 0:2:21,78
The fundamental reason

66
0:2:21,78 --> 0:2:24,15
lies in their exposure to so many geniuses.

67
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:24,85
Geniuses.

68
0:2:24,85 --> 0:2:26,61
A child's song drifted to Sanya.

69
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:28,41
A child ran 5 kilometers.

70
0:2:28,41 --> 0:2:30,19
From Anhui to Henan.

71
0:2:30,19 --> 0:2:32,259
Such things, how can they be described?

72
0:2:32,259 --> 0:2:34,179
It's like the memories from a past life haven't been erased.

73
0:2:34,179 --> 0:2:37,87
The outcome is that many talents are required for such things.

74
0:2:37,87 --> 0:2:39,769
Let's talk about the saying 'great things come to those who wait'.

75
0:2:39,769 --> 0:2:41,69
Great things come to those who wait.

76
0:2:41,69 --> 0:2:42,369
Many things, you see,

77
0:2:42,369 --> 0:2:44,529
are truly useful to society,

78
0:2:44,529 --> 0:2:46,86
these talents might not emerge until you're in your twenties,

79
0:2:46,86 --> 0:2:48,78
or even your thirties.

80
0:2:48,78 --> 0:2:50,67
So you can't be too hasty.

81
0:2:50,67 --> 0:2:52,43
Therefore, pushing kids too hard has no benefits.

82
0:2:52,43 --> 0:2:55,97
The most important thing for a child is to be happy.

83
0:2:55,97 --> 0:2:58,87
It’s about the accumulation of positive experiences during childhood.

84
0:2:58,87 --> 0:3:1,35
This will influence his memories of childhood many years later.

85
0:3:1,35 --> 0:3:4,38
When he looks back, he should have fond memories of his childhood.

86
0:3:4,38 --> 0:3:6,9
So, when it comes to a child’s development,

87
0:3:6,9 --> 0:3:9,1
it’s crucial to focus on cultivating good behavior and habits.

88
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:12,38
In this area, I recommend a balanced approach.

89
0:3:12,38 --> 0:3:14,32
For example, when it comes to my own experience,

90
0:3:14,32 --> 0:3:18,329
many children around me have regular routines for meals and sleep.

91
0:3:18,329 --> 0:3:19,429
Attend school regularly

92
0:3:19,429 --> 0:3:20,269
Maintain a regular schedule

93
0:3:20,269 --> 0:3:21,289
Engage in regular exercise

94
0:3:21,289 --> 0:3:22,609
Keep yourself in good health

95
0:3:22,609 --> 0:3:24,3
This is the right approach

96
0:3:24,3 --> 0:3:25,95
But when it comes to skill development

97
0:3:25,95 --> 0:3:28,7
You just need to ensure the child can survive

98
0:3:28,7 --> 0:3:29,5
That's really all it takes

99
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:30,57
Many parents are too anxious

100
0:3:30,57 --> 0:3:31,73
You, like me when I was a kid,

101
0:3:31,73 --> 0:3:32,99
also practiced the electronic keyboard,

102
0:3:32,99 --> 0:3:34,9
also took vocal lessons,

103
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:35,69
also dabbled in computers,

104
0:3:35,69 --> 0:3:37,41
also tried various input methods,

105
0:3:37,41 --> 0:3:38,35
also played Go,

106
0:3:38,35 --> 0:3:39,87
also practiced calligraphy,

107
0:3:39,87 --> 0:3:41,41
but what's the point of all these things?

108
0:3:41,41 --> 0:3:42,39
and even took art classes.

109
0:3:42,39 --> 0:3:44,51
Actually, I find these things to be the worst.

110
0:3:44,51 --> 0:3:46,27
I've always disliked these things

111
0:3:46,27 --> 0:3:49,57
I'm also not willing to spend more time learning about them.

112
0:3:49,57 --> 0:3:50,57
So, when it comes to it,

113
0:3:50,57 --> 0:3:53,67
this kind of accumulation is completely useless to me.

114
0:3:53,67 --> 0:3:56,43
Over time, it can even create a rebellious attitude.

115
0:3:56,43 --> 0:3:58,6
My art has always been graded on a two-point scale

116
0:3:58,6 --> 0:4:1,64
I have a particular disinterest in things like art and calligraphy.

117
0:4:1,64 --> 0:4:3,48
So, to be honest, parents in Haidian District say,

118
0:4:3,48 --> 0:4:6,19
Why am I particularly reluctant to go out for meals?

119
0:4:6,19 --> 0:4:7,299
Because every time it's mealtime,

120
0:4:7,299 --> 0:4:10,48
I notice parents picking up their kids right after school,

121
0:4:10,48 --> 0:4:13,8
and then start scolding them right away,

122
0:4:13,8 --> 0:4:14,48
Why didn’t you do your homework?

123
0:4:14,48 --> 0:4:15,9
Why are your grades so poor?

124
0:4:15,9 --> 0:4:17,76
Why do you always play on the tablet when you get home?

125
0:4:17,76 --> 0:4:18,68
It’s always the same story.

126
0:4:18,68 --> 0:4:21,92
And yet, these parents themselves don’t earn much either.

127
0:4:21,92 --> 0:4:25,23
Then, you also need to scold the child in various aspects.

128
0:4:25,23 --> 0:4:26,79
Parents are already very tired.

129
0:4:26,79 --> 0:4:27,79
So, I suggest you,

130
0:4:27,79 --> 0:4:29,95
if you are normal,

131
0:4:29,95 --> 0:4:32,8
if you think your child is just an average person,

132
0:4:32,8 --> 0:4:36,1
don't focus on his development before the age of 12.

133
0:4:36,1 --> 0:4:39,1
What I believe truly deserves cultivation is,

134
0:4:39,1 --> 0:4:42,0
for example, which good school he can get into for college,

135
0:4:42,0 --> 0:4:43,0
you should start preparing in advance.

136
0:4:43,0 --> 0:4:44,48
No matter if you choose the selection route

137
0:4:44,48 --> 0:4:48,48
or the unconventional path through the college entrance exam or the arts exam route

138
0:4:48,48 --> 0:4:50,5
This is what I can see

139
0:4:50,5 --> 0:4:52,69
Of course, not everyone is suited for the arts exam route

140
0:4:52,69 --> 0:4:53,81
But I’ve always told everyone

141
0:4:53,81 --> 0:4:56,6
The arts exam route is a relatively easier one

142
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:59,4
to boost your college entrance exam performance

143
0:4:59,4 --> 0:4:59,88
You could get into a first-tier university

144
0:4:59,88 --> 0:5:1,19
But you could get into a 211 university

145
0:5:1,19 --> 0:5:2,39
You can get into a 211 university

146
0:5:2,39 --> 0:5:3,55
but you could also aim for a 985

147
0:5:3,55 --> 0:5:6,27
Often, the arts exams can increase your chances

148
0:5:6,27 --> 0:5:7,79
of getting into a prestigious university

149
0:5:7,79 --> 0:5:8,95
This is a good thing

150
0:5:8,95 --> 0:5:10,77
And the arts are relatively easier

151
0:5:10,77 --> 0:5:14,34
They can reduce the difficulty of your middle and high school studies

152
0:5:14,34 --> 0:5:15,42
You need to understand

153
0:5:15,42 --> 0:5:18,48
that your child’s IQ is on the lower side

154
0:5:18,48 --> 0:5:20,94
In terms of your asset allocation,

155
0:5:20,94 --> 0:5:22,43
your level is relatively low.

156
0:5:22,43 --> 0:5:25,79
So, for an ordinary family,

157
0:5:25,79 --> 0:5:27,94
this is the least desirable option.

158
0:5:27,94 --> 0:5:29,9
A typical person,

159
0:5:29,9 --> 0:5:31,18
when they enter their youth,

160
0:5:31,18 --> 0:5:32,6
in their twenties and thirties,

161
0:5:32,6 --> 0:5:33,87
or even in their forties and fifties,

162
0:5:33,87 --> 0:5:36,83
should find ways to increase the value of their assets.

163
0:5:36,83 --> 0:5:38,58
Double your career

164
0:5:38,58 --> 0:5:40,36
This time, he should focus on

165
0:5:40,36 --> 0:5:40,86
Of course

166
0:5:40,86 --> 0:5:42,2
You're taking your family

167
0:5:42,2 --> 0:5:44,19
Starting a business with debt

168
0:5:44,19 --> 0:5:44,95
Trying to do something

169
0:5:44,95 --> 0:5:46,39
That sounds a bit like a fairy tale

170
0:5:46,39 --> 0:5:47,15
I don't think so

171
0:5:47,15 --> 0:5:49,999
One person can't entirely rely on these things

172
0:5:49,999 --> 0:5:50,879
having a family

173
0:5:50,879 --> 0:5:51,639
and a career

174
0:5:51,639 --> 0:5:52,199
is not very likely

175
0:5:52,199 --> 0:5:53,759
I think one has to make sacrifices

176
0:5:53,759 --> 0:5:55,64
like I sacrificed my marriage

177
0:5:55,64 --> 0:5:59,27
so having a career is a common human desire

178
0:5:59,27 --> 0:6:0,57
a normal state of affairs

179
0:6:0,57 --> 0:6:2,7
because if you want to achieve something great

180
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:4,63
the most important thing isn't actually the funding

181
0:6:4,63 --> 0:6:7,85
It's a complete cycle of your experiences.

182
0:6:7,85 --> 0:6:9,56
You need to have a complete one.

183
0:6:9,56 --> 0:6:12,2
Something that allows you to unleash your energy in Space

184
0:6:12,2 --> 0:6:14,48
And this thing should be something you find within your lifetime.

185
0:6:14,48 --> 0:6:16,39
Finding the right track for yourself.

186
0:6:16,39 --> 0:6:18,7
This is incredibly important.

187
0:6:18,7 --> 0:6:21,63
So we say that pushing your kids is the last resort.

188
0:6:21,63 --> 0:6:24,789
What you should really accumulate is your initial capital.

189
0:6:25,29 --> 0:6:26,669
If you accumulate initial capital,

190
0:6:26,669 --> 0:6:28,679
you might end up not getting married,

191
0:6:28,679 --> 0:6:30,879
or not having children.

192
0:6:30,879 --> 0:6:31,439
So, to put it another way,

193
0:6:33,429 --> 0:6:35,349
you should make a bold move in your career,

194
0:6:35,349 --> 0:6:35,949
make a second attempt,

195
0:6:35,949 --> 0:6:38,26
or even a third attempt, with small-scale trials and errors.

196
0:6:38,26 --> 0:6:40,26
You might actually see your career take off.

197
0:6:40,26 --> 0:6:42,43
And these issues would be resolved.

198
0:6:42,43 --> 0:6:44,19
What we usually see is,

199
0:6:44,19 --> 0:6:46,1
more people pin their hopes on the next generation.

200
0:6:46,1 --> 0:6:48,27
I think those who truly pin their hopes on the next generation,

201
0:6:48,27 --> 0:6:50,89
are actually at a loss with their own generation.

202
0:6:50,89 --> 0:6:52,93
So I really think parents in Haidian District,

203
0:6:52,93 --> 0:6:54,27
you can relax a bit,

204
0:6:54,27 --> 0:6:56,42
and have a second spring in your careers,

205
0:6:56,42 --> 0:6:58,26
rather than burdening your children,

206
0:6:58,26 --> 0:7:0,8
because your children might, in terms of ability,

207
0:7:0,8 --> 0:7:2,74
be even less capable than you at the genetic level.
