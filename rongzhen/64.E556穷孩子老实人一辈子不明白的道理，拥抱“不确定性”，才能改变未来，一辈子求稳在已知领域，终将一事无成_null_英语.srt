0:0:0,62 --> 0:0:1,42
Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,42 --> 0:0:3,74
We humans have a habit

3
0:0:3,74 --> 0:0:5,24
or perhaps it’s a flaw

4
0:0:5,24 --> 0:0:7,9
of observing

5
0:0:7,9 --> 0:0:9,44
and predicting

6
0:0:9,76 --> 0:0:12,26
Observing and predicting are like fortune-telling

7
0:0:12,26 --> 0:0:15,51
It is essentially an act of observation

8
0:0:15,51 --> 0:0:18,45
The purpose is to reduce uncertainty

9
0:0:18,45 --> 0:0:20,11
and increase certainty

10
0:0:20,11 --> 0:0:24,81
But the key to breaking through in life isn't about certainty.

11
0:0:24,81 --> 0:0:27,51
How should I put it, our Chinese nation is...

12
0:0:27,51 --> 0:0:31,45
Generally speaking, not particularly inclined to take risks.

13
0:0:31,45 --> 0:0:34,63
Considering our predominant way of life,

14
0:0:34,63 --> 0:0:37,95
Agriculture, fishing, hunting, and various other means,

15
0:0:38,23 --> 0:0:42,39
If we encounter natural disasters or all sorts of wars,

16
0:0:42,39 --> 0:0:44,41
Life becomes extremely difficult.

17
0:0:44,41 --> 0:0:45,75
Families break apart,

18
0:0:45,75 --> 0:0:47,29
Homes are destroyed and lives are lost.

19
0:0:47,77 --> 0:0:51,9
So, when we talk about it fundamentally

20
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:52,93
from the root of the source code

21
0:0:52,93 --> 0:0:54,769
it really dislikes uncertainty

22
0:0:54,769 --> 0:0:57,29
which is quite different from maritime civilizations

23
0:0:57,29 --> 0:0:59,569
maritime civilizations tend to enjoy adventure and exploration

24
0:0:59,569 --> 0:1:0,84
you might notice

25
0:1:0,84 --> 0:1:1,78
on this planet

26
0:1:1,78 --> 0:1:3,22
the majority at present

27
0:1:3,22 --> 0:1:6,52
is still the territory controlled by maritime civilizations

28
0:1:6,52 --> 0:1:8,9
Let's talk about the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand

29
0:1:8,9 --> 0:1:10,25
along with the South American colonies

30
0:1:10,25 --> 0:1:11,29
and the African colonies

31
0:1:11,29 --> 0:1:12,53
In many cases

32
0:1:12,53 --> 0:1:14,87
they actually controlled most of the territories

33
0:1:14,87 --> 0:1:17,23
If you want to change your life

34
0:1:17,23 --> 0:1:20,63
you should try to increase the uncertainties as much as possible

35
0:1:20,63 --> 0:1:21,53
The secret to life

36
0:1:21,53 --> 0:1:26,4
is that many people summarize the key to getting rich as the secret to life

37
0:1:26,4 --> 0:1:30,44
These things are summarized through observations of past experiences.

38
0:1:30,44 --> 0:1:32,34
To make definitive observations,

39
0:1:32,34 --> 0:1:35,2
One could say that the secret to life is actually just one thing:

40
0:1:35,2 --> 0:1:37,49
Increasing the proportion of uncertainty.

41
0:1:37,495 --> 0:1:41,17
For example, everything I do today,

42
0:1:41,17 --> 0:1:42,85
You can see, everything I do is fine.

43
0:1:42,85 --> 0:1:47,3
Like reading books and sleeping,

44
0:1:47,3 --> 0:1:48,85
Or going for a walk.

45
0:1:48,85 --> 0:1:52,3
On the surface, these things seem to add up.

46
0:1:52,3 --> 0:1:52,61
Well, how to put it

47
0:1:52,61 --> 0:1:56,23
I'm quite familiar with the habit of reading with certainty, right?

48
0:1:56,23 --> 0:1:58,1
Sleep is for restoring energy

49
0:1:58,1 --> 0:1:59,1
Going out for a walk

50
0:1:59,1 --> 0:2:0,44
Yeah, to get some sunshine

51
0:2:0,44 --> 0:2:4,46
But in fact, the route I take changes every time

52
0:2:4,46 --> 0:2:5,76
The books I read

53
0:2:5,76 --> 0:2:9,8
Often alter the dreams I have and my usual thoughts and feelings

54
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:13,269
It opens the door to my subconscious

55
0:2:13,269 --> 0:2:14,629
So, quite often,

56
0:2:14,629 --> 0:2:15,7
we find that

57
0:2:15,7 --> 0:2:19,58
it's this uncertainty that is the key to changing one's life.

58
0:2:19,58 --> 0:2:20,9
Many of us enjoy fortune-telling,

59
0:2:20,9 --> 0:2:23,17
but I’m not particularly into fortune-telling myself.

60
0:2:23,17 --> 0:2:25,73
However, I know a lot of people who are into astrology,

61
0:2:25,73 --> 0:2:26,99
face reading,

62
0:2:26,99 --> 0:2:27,73
tarot reading,

63
0:2:27,73 --> 0:2:28,649
and palm reading.

64
0:2:28,649 --> 0:2:30,89
Zi Wei Dou Shu

65
0:2:30,89 --> 0:2:34,609
there are all kinds of methods, traditional Western

66
0:2:34,609 --> 0:2:35,94
and Eastern

67
0:2:36,22 --> 0:2:38,54
The reason I'm reluctant to have my fortune told is

68
0:2:38,54 --> 0:2:41,86
because fortune-telling can increase the certainty in your life

69
0:2:41,86 --> 0:2:46,129
but since my life’s certainty is already quite good

70
0:2:46,129 --> 0:2:49,56
I’m willing to reinforce this positive affirmation

71
0:2:49,56 --> 0:2:52,4
but doing so can also lead to

72
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:54,2
less change in your life

73
0:2:54,2 --> 0:2:56,4
The most important thing in life is to embrace change.

74
0:2:56,4 --> 0:2:57,8
Your fate is already determined.

75
0:2:57,8 --> 0:2:59,0
You’ve already observed it.

76
0:2:59,0 --> 0:3:0,2
It’s predestined.

77
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:2,92
The more you observe these things, the more certain they become.

78
0:3:2,92 --> 0:3:5,19
Their nature can’t be altered.

79
0:3:5,19 --> 0:3:6,95
In many moments of life, you’ll see this.

80
0:3:6,95 --> 0:3:8,13
That’s how it works.

81
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:10,579
For instance, the major events in my life.

82
0:3:10,579 --> 0:3:12,99
Let's not talk about other major events

83
0:3:12,99 --> 0:3:13,499
just about what's relevant to all of you

84
0:3:13,499 --> 0:3:15,599
In June 2020

85
0:3:15,599 --> 0:3:18,279
I had already started living apart before the divorce

86
0:3:18,279 --> 0:3:19,839
We went to get the divorce certificate two weeks after separating

87
0:3:19,839 --> 0:3:23,79
Right?

88
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:24,12
During this time, I started chatting on a mattress program

89
0:3:24,12 --> 0:3:27,22
The show first started with posts on Weibo

90
0:3:27,22 --> 0:3:28,98
The show first started posting on Weibo

91
0:3:28,98 --> 0:3:31,8
Because I had followers on Weibo before

92
0:3:31,8 --> 0:3:33,99
I used to post videos on Weibo

93
0:3:33,99 --> 0:3:36,15
Weibo is a platform for text

94
0:3:36,15 --> 0:3:38,61
Who would spend a lot of time watching videos?

95
0:3:38,61 --> 0:3:40,35
It's like posting on Douyin today

96
0:3:40,35 --> 0:3:42,28
If you post long videos

97
0:3:42,28 --> 0:3:43,8
It's actually a short video platform

98
0:3:43,8 --> 0:3:44,6
It's a text platform

99
0:3:44,6 --> 0:3:46,3
Not many people watch

100
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:48,73
Back then, if I had posted on Bilibili

101
0:3:48,73 --> 0:3:50,87
the outcome today might have been very different

102
0:3:50,87 --> 0:3:54,31
or if I had started posting on YouTube a few years earlier while studying abroad

103
0:3:54,31 --> 0:3:55,57
it might have felt even more different

104
0:3:56,57 --> 0:3:58,11
But why didn't I do it?

105
0:3:58,11 --> 0:4:1,3
Well, I studied directing

106
0:4:1,3 --> 0:4:2,65
and acting

107
0:4:2,65 --> 0:4:3,79
I'm in the film industry

108
0:4:3,79 --> 0:4:7,97
The thing I'm most certain about is film

109
0:4:7,97 --> 0:4:8,53
TV series

110
0:4:8,53 --> 0:4:12,74
short videos like plays don’t really make money, right?

111
0:4:12,74 --> 0:4:14,44
and they don’t have much practical value either

112
0:4:14,44 --> 0:4:15,72
it’s just someone chatting away

113
0:4:15,72 --> 0:4:17,39
what practical value does it have?

114
0:4:17,39 --> 0:4:20,959
but you never know in this uncertain world

115
0:4:20,959 --> 0:4:24,39
these things actually carry immense power

116
0:4:24,39 --> 0:4:27,279
you never know how far this video might travel

117
0:4:27,279 --> 0:4:29,7
that’s the secret of the internet age

118
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:31,48
You need to promote your movie.

119
0:4:31,48 --> 0:4:32,12
Or stage a play.

120
0:4:32,12 --> 0:4:33,34
If no one comes to watch, there's no show.

121
0:4:33,34 --> 0:4:35,11
It's like writing a book now.

122
0:4:35,11 --> 0:4:37,55
Only those who buy the book can read it.

123
0:4:37,55 --> 0:4:38,87
But when it comes to browsing videos,

124
0:4:38,87 --> 0:4:40,63
You might suddenly come across one.

125
0:4:40,63 --> 0:4:41,19
Come across one.

126
0:4:41,19 --> 0:4:44,19
You might end up watching all of my over a thousand videos.

127
0:4:44,19 --> 0:4:45,91
Then you'll become my follower.

128
0:4:45,91 --> 0:4:49,39
So this thing has a huge amount of uncertainty.

129
0:4:49,39 --> 0:4:53,39
And I started on November 15, 2022.

130
0:4:53,39 --> 0:4:54,57
That's when I started gaining popularity on Bilibili.

131
0:4:54,57 --> 0:4:56,99
But before that, I had 2,200 followers.

132
0:4:56,99 --> 0:4:59,89
I was quite reluctant back then.

133
0:4:59,89 --> 0:5:0,73
Maybe once every month,

134
0:5:0,73 --> 0:5:2,73
or once every two months, I would upload something to Bilibili.

135
0:5:2,73 --> 0:5:3,53
I used to post my videos on Weibo.

136
0:5:3,53 --> 0:5:6,82
I basically update my Weibo videos every three to four days.

137
0:5:6,82 --> 0:5:10,0
During that period, Weibo membership brought me a small amount of income.

138
0:5:10,0 --> 0:5:11,98
With a relatively small number of followers,

139
0:5:11,98 --> 0:5:13,1
it’s now just around 130,000.

140
0:5:13,1 --> 0:5:13,78
Take a look,

141
0:5:13,78 --> 0:5:14,74
plus these 670,000 followers,

142
0:5:14,74 --> 0:5:15,87
I have a total of 800,000 across all platforms.

143
0:5:15,87 --> 0:5:18,85
So, my Weibo follower count is really quite low.

144
0:5:18,85 --> 0:5:20,27
Speaking of Weibo followers,

145
0:5:20,27 --> 0:5:21,31
To be honest

146
0:5:21,31 --> 0:5:23,169
there are a lot of fake followers

147
0:5:23,169 --> 0:5:26,549
on this Weibo platform, you see tens of millions of followers

148
0:5:26,549 --> 0:5:27,769
but many of them are fake

149
0:5:27,769 --> 0:5:28,489
they're not real

150
0:5:28,489 --> 0:5:30,689
unlike Bilibili followers, who are more valuable

151
0:5:30,689 --> 0:5:32,58
they are genuine fans

152
0:5:32,98 --> 0:5:36,56
back then, all my certainty was on Weibo

153
0:5:36,56 --> 0:5:38,42
so I preferred to post on Weibo

154
0:5:38,42 --> 0:5:39,86
I didn't want to post on Bilibili either

155
0:5:39,86 --> 0:5:42,78
And just like that, two and a half years passed

156
0:5:42,78 --> 0:5:44,62
Two and a half years went by

157
0:5:44,62 --> 0:5:46,26
After I posted on Weibo for a year

158
0:5:46,26 --> 0:5:48,67
It's now June 2025

159
0:5:48,67 --> 0:5:50,47
I'm talking about what happened after I became popular

160
0:5:50,47 --> 0:5:51,55
I didn't become popular for two and a half years

161
0:5:51,55 --> 0:5:53,6
Two and a half years of not being popular, then two and a half years of being popular

162
0:5:53,6 --> 0:5:55,36
So at the beginning, when I wasn't popular

163
0:5:55,36 --> 0:5:57,58
During those two and a half years, I was posting on Weibo.

164
0:5:57,58 --> 0:5:59,56
So, it grew quite slowly.

165
0:5:59,56 --> 0:6:1,39
Gaining followers is kind of like this.

166
0:6:1,39 --> 0:6:4,81
I was wandering in a state of certainty.

167
0:6:4,81 --> 0:6:6,97
Every time I posted a video,

168
0:6:6,97 --> 0:6:8,59
I would gain a few hundred followers.

169
0:6:8,59 --> 0:6:11,73
Each video would spark some heated discussions.

170
0:6:11,73 --> 0:6:13,45
At the very least, there would be a few thousand views.

171
0:6:13,45 --> 0:6:14,72
At most, it could reach a few hundred thousand.

172
0:6:14,72 --> 0:6:15,96
It even has a million views

173
0:6:15,96 --> 0:6:18,1
But the conversion rate is actually quite low

174
0:6:18,1 --> 0:6:20,26
Because the nature of the Weibo platform is like that

175
0:6:20,26 --> 0:6:23,22
It's similar to how many people are reluctant to change careers in our daily lives

176
0:6:23,22 --> 0:6:26,56
We Chinese are very, very wary of this

177
0:6:26,56 --> 0:6:29,59
Changing careers or doing unstable jobs

178
0:6:29,59 --> 0:6:31,77
Parents always advise you to take stable jobs

179
0:6:31,77 --> 0:6:35,33
But only by taking on uncertainties can you change your fate

180
0:6:35,33 --> 0:6:37,3
You're like me coming to Bilibili

181
0:6:37,3 --> 0:6:37,81
I came to Bilibili

182
0:6:37,81 --> 0:6:38,85
I started doing these things

183
0:6:38,85 --> 0:6:41,45
I didn't know these videos would become popular

184
0:6:41,45 --> 0:6:43,76
It wasn't until after I had posted quite a few episodes

185
0:6:43,76 --> 0:6:46,0
Actually, it was the 147th episode that took off

186
0:6:46,0 --> 0:6:47,6
But the things I did before that

187
0:6:47,6 --> 0:6:49,4
Most of what you see on Bilibili

188
0:6:49,4 --> 0:6:50,48
Before I became popular

189
0:6:50,48 --> 0:6:51,71
I didn't post that many videos

190
0:6:51,71 --> 0:6:53,71
But I decided to post on Bilibili

191
0:6:53,71 --> 0:6:55,43
because my Weibo account was suspended

192
0:6:55,43 --> 0:6:59,51
At that time, I had to pivot my operations

193
0:6:59,51 --> 0:7:0,67
I had to do something

194
0:7:0,67 --> 0:7:2,47
Because my passion for creation is still there

195
0:7:2,47 --> 0:7:4,65
It's just that the platform suspended my account

196
0:7:4,65 --> 0:7:7,61
The most crucial move I made at that time was to start posting on Bilibili

197
0:7:7,61 --> 0:7:8,97
And I didn't go to any other platforms

198
0:7:8,97 --> 0:7:10,49
Bilibili only had 2,200 followers back then

199
0:7:10,49 --> 0:7:13,63
It's the same as the number of followers many people have now.

200
0:7:13,99 --> 0:7:16,29
But back then, I kept posting on Bilibili.

201
0:7:16,29 --> 0:7:17,67
And I was putting in extra effort.

202
0:7:17,67 --> 0:7:20,73
That's when I was working on uncertainty.

203
0:7:20,73 --> 0:7:23,97
So you realize that major changes in life

204
0:7:23,97 --> 0:7:27,11
happen when you're dealing with the most uncertain events.

205
0:7:27,11 --> 0:7:28,35
You draw a card.

206
0:7:28,35 --> 0:7:30,25
Before you draw, you don't know what it is.

207
0:7:30,25 --> 0:7:31,81
If you draw with the cards face up,

208
0:7:31,81 --> 0:7:34,44
Your life will surely be determined by the choices you make.

209
0:7:34,44 --> 0:7:36,5
If you only do things that are certain,

210
0:7:36,5 --> 0:7:38,78
everyone does things that are certain,

211
0:7:38,78 --> 0:7:41,3
your life will not change,

212
0:7:41,3 --> 0:7:43,4
because this is a life that can be predicted.

213
0:7:43,4 --> 0:7:44,78
I've been posting on Weibo all my life,

214
0:7:44,78 --> 0:7:47,18
I might still be posting there now,

215
0:7:47,18 --> 0:7:47,74
if I keep posting,

216
0:7:47,74 --> 0:7:49,87
I might have at most 300,000 followers.

217
0:7:49,87 --> 0:7:50,91
There might also be an increase

218
0:7:50,91 --> 0:7:53,5
But where is the upper limit of Weibo's overall revenue?

219
0:7:53,5 --> 0:7:54,7
It won't make much money

220
0:7:54,7 --> 0:7:56,82
And that era has already passed

221
0:7:56,82 --> 0:7:58,62
This is an outdated profession

222
0:7:58,62 --> 0:8:0,54
You might be in an outdated profession

223
0:8:0,54 --> 0:8:1,58
You have certainty

224
0:8:1,58 --> 0:8:3,83
How much more you can earn each day at work

225
0:8:3,83 --> 0:8:5,17
The total amount of salary you receive

226
0:8:5,17 --> 0:8:6,81
How much can it appreciate?

227
0:8:6,81 --> 0:8:7,75
How much will your pension be?

228
0:8:7,75 --> 0:8:9,67
These are all things you can determine and calculate.

229
0:8:9,67 --> 0:8:11,38
But if you go into business,

230
0:8:11,38 --> 0:8:13,24
If you suddenly move abroad,

231
0:8:13,24 --> 0:8:14,66
If you suddenly change jobs at this point,

232
0:8:14,66 --> 0:8:15,38
Move to a new city,

233
0:8:15,38 --> 0:8:15,98
Change your job,

234
0:8:15,98 --> 0:8:17,74
Switch industries or move abroad

235
0:8:17,74 --> 0:8:19,71
These things are all uncertainties.

236
0:8:19,71 --> 0:8:21,75
We tend to dislike uncertainties.

237
0:8:21,75 --> 0:8:24,43
At that time, I didn't know if I would become popular on Bilibili.

238
0:8:24,43 --> 0:8:26,9
But after doing it for a while,

239
0:8:26,9 --> 0:8:29,9
it collapses back into something certain.

240
0:8:29,9 --> 0:8:31,9
So this is the most crucial point.

241
0:8:31,9 --> 0:8:33,67
When we talk about many events we undertake,

242
0:8:33,67 --> 0:8:36,55
we can't control anything beyond the certainties.

243
0:8:36,55 --> 0:8:37,99
Once something is determined,

244
0:8:37,99 --> 0:8:39,93
It's time for a change, isn't it?

245
0:8:39,93 --> 0:8:41,33
Once you've decided,

246
0:8:41,33 --> 0:8:42,89
you'll get used to it.

247
0:8:42,89 --> 0:8:44,53
it won't change anymore.

248
0:8:44,53 --> 0:8:45,83
There won't be any more changes.

249
0:8:45,83 --> 0:8:46,73
You'll get used to it.

250
0:8:46,73 --> 0:8:48,68
But we enjoy these kinds of things in life.

251
0:8:48,68 --> 0:8:51,219
We only go out to play after checking the guides.

252
0:8:51,219 --> 0:8:52,179
Whatever we do

253
0:8:52,179 --> 0:8:53,939
With the lessons from predecessors,

254
0:8:53,939 --> 0:8:55,99
we are motivated to act.

255
0:8:55,99 --> 0:8:55,979
Zhang Haifeng tells you,

256
0:8:55,979 --> 0:8:56,819
this major is great,

257
0:8:56,819 --> 0:8:57,75
so you choose it,

258
0:8:57,75 --> 0:8:59,69
but millions of others choose the same path,

259
0:8:59,69 --> 0:9:0,859
and the competition intensifies.

260
0:9:0,859 --> 0:9:2,499
So, the key lies in this:

261
0:9:2,499 --> 0:9:3,979
you must embrace uncertainty,

262
0:9:3,979 --> 0:9:5,79
embrace the unknown,

263
0:9:5,79 --> 0:9:7,47
embrace uncharted territories,

264
0:9:7,47 --> 0:9:8,95
paths not yet walked,

265
0:9:8,95 --> 0:9:10,71
outcomes that cannot be predicted.

266
0:9:10,71 --> 0:9:13,19
Only then will you achieve favorable results,

267
0:9:13,19 --> 0:9:14,71
transform your life,

268
0:9:14,71 --> 0:9:18,109
and add new certainties to your life’s certainty.

269
0:9:18,109 --> 0:9:23,189
In other words, new certainties emerge

270
0:9:23,189 --> 0:9:24,89
from old uncertainties,

271
0:9:24,89 --> 0:9:26,549
while always relying on old certainties

272
0:9:26,549 --> 0:9:28,96
only increases their proportion.

273
0:9:28,96 --> 0:9:29,84
That's how it is.

274
0:9:29,84 --> 0:9:32,28
If I were still updating on Weibo today,

275
0:9:32,28 --> 0:9:34,22
that would be adding to the old certainties.

276
0:9:34,22 --> 0:9:36,38
My followers would still grow,

277
0:9:36,38 --> 0:9:39,78
but the growth and income would be much less compared to Bilibili.

278
0:9:39,78 --> 0:9:41,42
But doing this on Bilibili

279
0:9:41,42 --> 0:9:42,44
is meaningful.

280
0:9:42,44 --> 0:9:45,26
Of course, one day, Bilibili might not be as good,

281
0:9:45,26 --> 0:9:46,38
not as conducive to growth,

282
0:9:46,38 --> 0:9:50,69
and then exploring a new uncertainty on YouTube could be a new venture.

283
0:9:50,69 --> 0:9:51,929
This is the essence of life’s existence,

284
0:9:51,929 --> 0:9:53,809
to strive against uncertainty,

285
0:9:53,809 --> 0:9:55,849
to bet on uncertainty,

286
0:9:55,849 --> 0:9:58,38
only then can you truly defy fate and change your destiny.
