Hi everyone

2
0:0:2,26 --> 0:0:3,26
This isn't looking too good

3
0:0:3,26 --> 0:0:4,92
But I still have to say this

4
0:0:4,92 --> 0:0:7,68
Because I don't think it's worth doing another episode on this

5
0:0:7,68 --> 0:0:9,42
So, could you please

6
0:0:9,42 --> 0:0:12,94
Not bring kids under 12 to ski?

7
0:0:12,94 --> 0:0:16,2
I'm talking to you, the so-called middle-class parents

8
0:0:16,2 --> 0:0:18,62
Are you trying to elevate your social status through your kids?

9
0:0:18,62 --> 0:0:21,94
Now there are even two-year-olds on the ski slopes on Xiaohongshu

10
0:0:21,94 --> 0:0:22,62
Where are the skis?

11
0:0:22,62 --> 0:0:24,84
You know about skiing, right?

12
0:0:24,84 --> 0:0:26,4
In Western countries,

13
0:0:26,4 --> 0:0:27,48
it's a trendy activity,

14
0:0:27,48 --> 0:0:29,73
but the fatality and injury rates are quite high.

15
0:0:29,73 --> 0:0:31,75
Actually, I suggest you consider,

16
0:0:31,75 --> 0:0:34,12
letting your child practice stunt motorcycling.

17
0:0:34,12 --> 0:0:36,24
The fatality rate for stunt motorcycling

18
0:0:36,24 --> 0:0:37,64
is lower than that of skiing.

19
0:0:37,64 --> 0:0:40,36
The risk in skiing isn't about whether you can do it or not,

20
0:0:40,36 --> 0:0:41,48
it can happen suddenly.

21
0:0:41,48 --> 0:0:43,52
You, like me, a 170-pound adult,

22
0:0:43,52 --> 0:0:45,3
could send your 30-pound child flying,

23
0:0:45,3 --> 0:0:46,8
and there's a high chance they might end up permanently disabled,

24
0:0:46,8 --> 0:0:48,6
or even in a vegetative state.

25
0:0:48,6 --> 0:0:51,9
You middle-aged moms facing a midlife crisis,

26
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:52,5
can you please

27
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:56,89
just not use your children as tools for social mobility?

28
0:0:56,89 --> 0:0:58,45
If you're experiencing a midlife crisis,

29
0:0:58,45 --> 0:0:59,549
consider having an affair,

30
0:0:59,549 --> 0:1:0,589
it might actually be a good thing.

31
0:1:0,589 --> 0:1:1,549
This is quite good.

32
0:1:1,549 --> 0:1:4,609
Then you can dream about meeting a domineering CEO.

33
0:1:4,609 --> 0:1:7,489
And have the domineering CEO duel with your husband.

34
0:1:7,489 --> 0:1:10,189
Don't think of using your young child for that.

35
0:1:10,189 --> 0:1:12,289
Especially children under 18.

36
0:1:12,289 --> 0:1:13,609
If it's not their own wish.

37
0:1:13,609 --> 0:1:14,769
Don't take them to the ski resort.

38
0:1:14,769 --> 0:1:15,689
Whether it's the beginner slopes.

39
0:1:15,689 --> 0:1:16,489
Intermediate to advanced slopes.

40
0:1:16,489 --> 0:1:17,409
Because of those instructors.

41
0:1:17,409 --> 0:1:18,749
Those people at the ski resorts

42
0:1:18,749 --> 0:1:21,979
Those refined ones, how do I put it

43
0:1:21,979 --> 0:1:23,219
The refined elites on Xiaohongshu

44
0:1:23,219 --> 0:1:25,9
They won't tell you the truth

45
0:1:25,9 --> 0:1:28,23
They won't foot the medical bills for your child

46
0:1:28,23 --> 0:1:30,78
So many people around me

47
0:1:30,78 --> 0:1:32,46
Who have been disabled

48
0:1:32,46 --> 0:1:33,42
Who have lost money

49
0:1:33,42 --> 0:1:35,17
Who have been severely injured

50
0:1:35,17 --> 0:1:36,5
Are all here

51
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:37,13
But you keep on

52
0:1:37,13 --> 0:1:40,1
You should take responsibility for your 120 pounds

53
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:41,29
Or your 160 pounds

54
0:1:41,29 --> 0:1:42,0
It doesn’t matter

55
0:1:42,0 --> 0:1:43,16
If you die, so be it

56
0:1:43,16 --> 0:1:45,81
Your lives don’t seem to have much value, right

57
0:1:45,81 --> 0:1:48,61
But please don’t let the flowers of our country

58
0:1:48,61 --> 0:1:51,69
The future ones who could potentially bring more social value

59
0:1:51,69 --> 0:1:52,93
These young people

60
0:1:52,93 --> 0:1:55,85
Those post-2010s, don’t take them to their deaths, okay

61
0:1:55,85 --> 0:1:57,13
Especially after 2020

62
0:1:57,13 --> 0:1:58,37
Don't do that

63
0:1:58,37 --> 0:2:0,5
Don't do such despicable things

64
0:2:0,5 --> 0:2:0,93
This is murder

65
0:2:0,93 --> 0:2:2,94
Are you really that clueless

66
0:2:2,94 --> 0:2:4,8
You guys are clueless

67
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:5,3
If you die, so be it

68
0:2:5,3 --> 0:2:5,84
It's not a pity

69
0:2:5,84 --> 0:2:7,9
But don't let the kids suffer

70
0:2:7,9 --> 0:2:8,46
Ok
