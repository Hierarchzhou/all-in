0:0:0,58 --> 0:0:2,2
Hey, it's episode 526.

2
0:0:2,2 --> 0:0:4,88
Today, I, Lao Rong, am sitting down with everyone to discuss.

3
0:0:4,88 --> 0:0:9,9
Let's discuss the concept of Yin and Yang in Chinese Culture.

4
0:0:9,9 --> 0:0:10,99
Yang has its own path.

5
0:0:10,99 --> 0:0:13,9
And Yin has another path.

6
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:14,34
They are different.

7
0:0:14,34 --> 0:0:17,38
Often, we talk about being consistent inside and out.

8
0:0:17,38 --> 0:0:19,28
But in reality, the surface and the inside can be different.

9
0:0:19,28 --> 0:0:20,3
There are many aspects to consider.

10
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:22,54
It represents the interplay of yin and yang

11
0:0:22,54 --> 0:0:24,12
and the connection between above and below

12
0:0:24,12 --> 0:0:24,88
which are in opposition

13
0:0:24,88 --> 0:0:28,43
meaning that some things have one form in folk culture

14
0:0:28,43 --> 0:0:30,41
and another form in official contexts

15
0:0:30,41 --> 0:0:32,94
some things look one way for men

16
0:0:32,94 --> 0:0:34,62
and another way for women

17
0:0:34,62 --> 0:0:36,51
some things appear one way on the surface

18
0:0:36,51 --> 0:0:38,69
but are quite different behind the scenes

19
0:0:38,69 --> 0:0:42,22
We often say that our culture is inclusive and diverse.

20
0:0:42,22 --> 0:0:44,74
Chinese culture has elements of subtlety.

21
0:0:44,74 --> 0:0:46,14
This is quite prevalent.

22
0:0:46,14 --> 0:0:48,3
It's more of a philosophy of survival.

23
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:51,27
After all, we are a civilization with a history of thousands of years.

24
0:0:51,27 --> 0:0:52,75
Isn't it a civilization with a 5000-year history?

25
0:0:52,75 --> 0:0:54,91
More accurately, it's a blend of various civilizations.

26
0:0:54,91 --> 0:0:57,54
Along with this inclusiveness.

27
0:0:57,54 --> 0:1:1,0
Of course, we have our own cultural and philosophical traditions.

28
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:2,26
There are many things to talk about

29
0:1:2,26 --> 0:1:3,58
like what we're discussing today

30
0:1:3,58 --> 0:1:5,22
including what you see me talking about

31
0:1:5,22 --> 0:1:8,52
although on the surface, I'm discussing Machiavellianism

32
0:1:8,52 --> 0:1:11,8
the core foundations of Western political science

33
0:1:11,8 --> 0:1:13,52
and Adlerian psychology in the West

34
0:1:13,52 --> 0:1:18,14
and how to put it, Max Weber's sociology in the West

35
0:1:18,14 --> 0:1:21,3
but in reality, I'm also delving into our own

36
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:23,22
Chinese philosophical principles

37
0:1:23,22 --> 0:1:29,73
Oh, last time I talked about the widespread AOE among the post-60s and post-70s generation.

38
0:1:29,73 --> 0:1:33,9
So many people said, 'Hey, Brother Rong, that's not right.'

39
0:1:33,9 --> 0:1:35,79
Actually, there are quite a few post-60s and post-70s who are pretty decent.

40
0:1:35,79 --> 0:1:37,64
I was referring to these decent people,

41
0:1:37,64 --> 0:1:41,3
who are definitely more open-minded in their generation,

42
0:1:41,3 --> 0:1:42,78
more understanding,

43
0:1:42,78 --> 0:1:45,28
and more capable of being inclusive.

44
0:1:45,28 --> 0:1:48,789
And those who lack this inclusiveness,

45
0:1:48,789 --> 0:1:51,249
the ones who get upset and angry right away,

46
0:1:51,249 --> 0:1:55,9
Actually, to me, animals are just objects to be utilized.

47
0:1:55,9 --> 0:1:57,77
It's because, from any era you look at it,

48
0:1:57,77 --> 0:1:59,87
or from any perspective,

49
0:1:59,87 --> 0:2:1,57
we say no regional discrimination,

50
0:2:1,57 --> 0:2:3,5
no ageism,

51
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:4,47
no gender discrimination.

52
0:2:4,47 --> 0:2:8,35
But when you don't engage in some aspects of communication studies

53
0:2:8,35 --> 0:2:12,51
your content won’t create much of a stir,

54
0:2:12,51 --> 0:2:15,15
and after watching, it won’t evoke any emotional response from the audience.

55
0:2:15,15 --> 0:2:15,91
When it comes to this thing

56
0:2:15,91 --> 0:2:17,63
From the perspective of communication studies

57
0:2:17,63 --> 0:2:19,51
It won’t spread very far

58
0:2:19,51 --> 0:2:21,69
Therefore, it hasn’t been properly transmitted

59
0:2:21,69 --> 0:2:23,11
It’s given a strong name as the Way

60
0:2:23,11 --> 0:2:24,93
Even though it’s named as the Way

61
0:2:24,93 --> 0:2:27,879
In reality, there’s nothing gained, nothing to be gained

62
0:2:27,879 --> 0:2:29,179
So when it comes to many things

63
0:2:29,179 --> 0:2:33,42
The purpose of spreading something is actually about

64
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:35,62
A genuine achievement

65
0:2:35,62 --> 0:2:37,89
A real celebrity

66
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:40,1
The established figures from the 1960s

67
0:2:40,1 --> 0:2:40,49
And those from the 1970s

68
0:2:40,49 --> 0:2:44,85
is dismissive of the previous forum or video

69
0:2:44,85 --> 0:2:46,62
To hurl insults at others

70
0:2:46,62 --> 0:2:48,62
Or engage in verbal battles through private messages

71
0:2:48,62 --> 0:2:51,46
When you are 50, even 60 years old

72
0:2:51,46 --> 0:2:53,16
Or 70 years old

73
0:2:53,16 --> 0:2:55,72
At 567, you're already one foot in the grave.

74
0:2:55,72 --> 0:2:57,4
The yellow earth is already up to your neck.

75
0:2:57,4 --> 0:2:59,329
It’s already up to your chin.

76
0:2:59,329 --> 0:3:1,569
You’re going to compete with the younger generation?

77
0:3:1,569 --> 0:3:4,909
This first shows that you haven’t attained enlightenment.

78
0:3:4,909 --> 0:3:7,4
You lack virtue.

79
0:3:7,4 --> 0:3:9,78
You haven’t seen through the mechanisms of life.

80
0:3:9,78 --> 0:3:11,31
Secondly, speaking of which,

81
0:3:11,31 --> 0:3:13,73
Aren’t there many people of your generation?

82
0:3:13,73 --> 0:3:15,11
Indeed, just like Yuan Tengfei

83
0:3:15,11 --> 0:3:16,13
just like Shi Guopeng

84
0:3:16,13 --> 0:3:17,27
it's this kind of thinking

85
0:3:17,27 --> 0:3:19,58
this is the understanding I was talking about

86
0:3:19,58 --> 0:3:21,66
it also refers to some of the outstanding figures

87
0:3:21,66 --> 0:3:22,62
he is like this

88
0:3:22,62 --> 0:3:24,88
but this is the sorrow of the times

89
0:3:24,88 --> 0:3:27,44
it flows like a long river

90
0:3:27,44 --> 0:3:28,66
it is the sorrow of the times

91
0:3:28,66 --> 0:3:29,66
So it's a monk

92
0:3:29,66 --> 0:3:31,28
Haha, it doesn't matter

93
0:3:31,28 --> 0:3:32,78
But for the later generations

94
0:3:32,78 --> 0:3:36,19
The younger ones looking ahead

95
0:3:36,19 --> 0:3:38,61
When they look at people like you

96
0:3:38,61 --> 0:3:41,35
They actually see things quite clearly

97
0:3:41,35 --> 0:3:45,25
Especially for those of us who are better at English

98
0:3:45,25 --> 0:3:46,95
When we look at America or the West

99
0:3:46,95 --> 0:3:49,1
We see things more clearly, right?

100
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:51,48
Because you didn't get an 8.05 in IELTS, right?

101
0:3:51,48 --> 0:3:52,72
That's how it is.

102
0:3:52,72 --> 0:3:54,76
So many times, these people are not convinced.

103
0:3:54,76 --> 0:3:57,74
These people, their views on Western politics are often shaped by a lack of understanding.

104
0:3:57,74 --> 0:4:2,56
They have a deep and profound affection for Western systems.

105
0:4:2,56 --> 0:4:3,92
A profound love, you see.

106
0:4:3,92 --> 0:4:5,48
That's just the way it is.

107
0:4:5,48 --> 0:4:6,62
They simply don't understand.

108
0:4:6,62 --> 0:4:9,4
They suffer from not being proficient in English.

109
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:9,649
Did you know?

110
0:4:9,649 --> 0:4:13,429
They haven't implemented widespread scientific literacy education.

111
0:4:13,429 --> 0:4:14,889
Nor have they provided education in humanities and political science.

112
0:4:14,889 --> 0:4:18,54
So, he always has a vague admiration for these things.

113
0:4:18,54 --> 0:4:21,12
It's almost like a religious sentiment.

114
0:4:21,12 --> 0:4:23,28
A deep affection for A MEEA.

115
0:4:23,28 --> 0:4:24,58
So, it's quite normal.

116
0:4:24,58 --> 0:4:27,49
He has experienced the United States during the Clinton era.

117
0:4:27,49 --> 0:4:31,1
He has seen the U.S. military during the Gulf War.

118
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:33,22
He looks ambitious.

119
0:4:33,22 --> 0:4:34,86
Watching Titanic,

120
0:4:34,86 --> 0:4:37,69
he naturally has a fantasy about that kind of beauty,

121
0:4:37,69 --> 0:4:40,91
but this fantasy is disconnected from reality.

122
0:4:40,91 --> 0:4:42,39
In reality,

123
0:4:42,39 --> 0:4:45,52
what he sees is the emotions between white people,

124
0:4:45,52 --> 0:4:47,44
the emotions between white people and their countries,

125
0:4:47,44 --> 0:4:49,84
the love that white countries have for white people.

126
0:4:49,84 --> 0:4:53,66
He doesn’t factor in that he is a non-believer.

127
0:4:53,66 --> 0:4:55,46
I am not Anglo-Saxon

128
0:4:55,46 --> 0:4:56,84
I am of the yellow race

129
0:4:56,84 --> 0:4:58,76
I am a descendant of the Chinese civilization

130
0:4:58,76 --> 0:5:0,78
He couldn't have predicted this

131
0:5:0,78 --> 0:5:3,82
So it often leads to the tragedy of their era

132
0:5:3,82 --> 0:5:5,54
So it still hurts

133
0:5:5,54 --> 0:5:8,2
Hehe, why be so sad and hurt

134
0:5:8,2 --> 0:5:10,4
So just watch him

135
0:5:10,4 --> 0:5:11,69
It gets funnier

136
0:5:11,69 --> 0:5:13,97
Let's be honest here

137
0:5:15,81 --> 0:5:17,41
Where does power come from?

138
0:5:17,41 --> 0:5:18,73
He would say

139
0:5:18,73 --> 0:5:20,49
Whom does it serve?

140
0:5:20,49 --> 0:5:24,51
You folks, the older generations, the 60s and 70s babies

141
0:5:24,51 --> 0:5:25,67
Let me ask you

142
0:5:25,67 --> 0:5:26,65
People often say

143
0:5:26,65 --> 0:5:29,7
I've given you a like and followed you.

144
0:5:29,7 --> 0:5:30,11
You're amazing

145
0:5:30,11 --> 0:5:31,71
What's the point of it?

146
0:5:31,71 --> 0:5:32,64
Right?

147
0:5:32,64 --> 0:5:36,8
The most useful followers for me are those who have powered up with a payment.

148
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:38,4
My captain

149
0:5:38,4 --> 0:5:39,32
My consulting followers

150
0:5:39,32 --> 0:5:41,44
These people are putting in real money.

151
0:5:41,44 --> 0:5:42,27
For what?

152
0:5:42,27 --> 0:5:44,27
And what are most of these people?

153
0:5:44,27 --> 0:5:46,25
Mostly they are from the post-90s and post-00s generations.

154
0:5:46,25 --> 0:5:49,38
Most of them, you could say over 80%, are from the post-90s generation.

155
0:5:49,38 --> 0:5:51,4
There are very few from the post-80s generation.

156
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:52,22
And even fewer from the post-00s generation.

157
0:5:52,22 --> 0:5:54,8
Because the post-00s are still mostly in school.

158
0:5:54,8 --> 0:5:55,74
Speaking of the post-80s generation,

159
0:5:55,74 --> 0:5:57,28
many of them don't use Bilibili.

160
0:5:57,28 --> 0:6:0,4
There are usually only a few from the post-60s and post-70s generations.

161
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:1,48
Even if you really like it, from my perspective,

162
0:6:1,48 --> 0:6:4,51
it doesn't make much of a difference, right?

163
0:6:4,51 --> 0:6:6,9
No Poland, nothing to see here

164
0:6:6,9 --> 0:6:7,6
You're not a paying customer

165
0:6:7,6 --> 0:6:9,32
Others won't be inclined towards you

166
0:6:9,32 --> 0:6:11,84
Especially in today's internet context

167
0:6:11,84 --> 0:6:13,48
You had your time

168
0:6:13,48 --> 0:6:15,54
Back in your day, Yilin magazine

169
0:6:15,54 --> 0:6:18,5
Many things were already given to you back then

170
0:6:18,5 --> 0:6:21,5
So arguing with people online now

171
0:6:21,5 --> 0:6:23,1
Or criticizing those people

172
0:6:23,1 --> 0:6:25,8
You're actually a giant baby of the times.

173
0:6:25,8 --> 0:6:27,78
You've already passed the age of thirty, the age of establishment.

174
0:6:27,78 --> 0:6:30,66
Forty is the age of no confusion, which is already in your fifties or sixties.

175
0:6:31,56 --> 0:6:32,63
The age of sixty, the age of maturity.

176
0:6:32,63 --> 0:6:34,39
By then, you'll have lost most of your functions.

177
0:6:34,39 --> 0:6:35,59
You would have already retired.

178
0:6:35,59 --> 0:6:39,27
Now you're using software that young people use online.

179
0:6:39,27 --> 0:6:40,91
And competing for gold with the younger generation.

180
0:6:40,91 --> 0:6:42,18
What's your reason for that?

181
0:6:42,18 --> 0:6:44,24
You're most likely around 1450.

182
0:6:44,86 --> 0:6:47,909
You're not a true person from the 60s or 70s.

183
0:6:47,909 --> 0:6:50,309
Think about how many people from the 80s use Bilibili.

184
0:6:50,309 --> 0:6:54,469
People from the sixties and seventies who still use Bilibili to watch trending videos

185
0:6:54,469 --> 0:6:56,77
make up a small portion of the crowd.

186
0:6:56,77 --> 0:6:59,17
I'm even among the genuine followers

187
0:6:59,17 --> 0:7:0,57
Among the genuine paying followers

188
0:7:0,57 --> 0:7:2,69
people in this age group are very few.

189
0:7:2,69 --> 0:7:6,544
Because I can see the actual data precisely in the backend.

190
0:7:6,61 --> 0:7:9,95
My followers from the post-90s generation make up about 400,000.

191
0:7:9,95 --> 0:7:13,1
My Gen X and Gen Y followers add up to 390.

192
0:7:13,1 --> 0:7:13,45
Right?

193
0:7:13,45 --> 0:7:14,65
You can't even tell.

194
0:7:14,65 --> 0:7:17,44
So how did these people suddenly appear?

195
0:7:17,44 --> 0:7:19,92
That's why many people notice this kind of thing.

196
0:7:19,92 --> 0:7:20,82
Seeing this kind of traffic,

197
0:7:20,82 --> 0:7:22,75
they think it's about them.

198
0:7:22,75 --> 0:7:24,3
You are not who you think you are.

199
0:7:24,3 --> 0:7:25,35
You don't have to admit it.

200
0:7:25,35 --> 0:7:27,19
You can just click the exit button in the top right corner.

201
0:7:27,19 --> 0:7:28,89
Why do you have to complain?

202
0:7:28,89 --> 0:7:30,31
Why do you have to attack?

203
0:7:30,31 --> 0:7:31,62
It's pointless.

204
0:7:32,1 --> 0:7:35,38
So if you want to achieve something in today's self-media, 

205
0:7:35,38 --> 0:7:36,86
you first can't be afraid of being attacked.

206
0:7:36,86 --> 0:7:38,14
You also can't be afraid of being slandered.

207
0:7:38,14 --> 0:7:39,99
Sometimes you just need to AOE.

208
0:7:39,99 --> 0:7:42,25
Sometimes, overcorrection is necessary.

209
0:7:42,25 --> 0:7:44,15
After you've said something that went too far,

210
0:7:44,15 --> 0:7:45,39
you should apologize if you need to.

211
0:7:45,39 --> 0:7:47,85
But if you're constantly afraid of losing followers,

212
0:7:47,85 --> 0:7:49,81
constantly afraid of saying something too harsh,

213
0:7:49,81 --> 0:7:51,17
you'll never gain new followers.

214
0:7:51,17 --> 0:7:52,74
You won't grow at all.

215
0:7:52,74 --> 0:7:54,36
It's the same with everything.

216
0:7:54,36 --> 0:7:55,86
Including when you see me criticizing Confucius.

217
0:7:55,86 --> 0:7:58,68
Isn't Confucius considered the Supreme Sage and Teacher?

218
0:7:58,68 --> 0:8:0,96
Isn't he?

219
0:8:0,96 --> 0:8:1,88
Well, it's a bit complicated.

220
0:8:1,88 --> 0:8:4,32
He was one of the notable scholars during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.

221
0:8:4,32 --> 0:8:5,32
So, when we talk about it,

222
0:8:5,32 --> 0:8:6,8
we're discussing Confucius's historical significance.

223
0:8:6,8 --> 0:8:10,55
It's not something that can be undermined by just a few words from me.

224
0:8:10,55 --> 0:8:11,98
I've also mentioned Zhuge Liang.

225
0:8:11,98 --> 0:8:15,32
Is it because I dislike the Chancellor that I talk about Zhuge Liang?

226
0:8:15,32 --> 0:8:19,46
I'm not talking about the Zhuge Liang from historical records.

227
0:8:19,46 --> 0:8:21,16
I mean, not the Zhuge Liang from the novel.

228
0:8:21,16 --> 0:8:23,92
When I mention Zhuge Liang, this person who has been gone for a thousand years,

229
0:8:23,92 --> 0:8:25,74
it's not to nitpick or criticize him.

230
0:8:25,74 --> 0:8:29,329
Rather, it's for the people who admire him in later generations,

231
0:8:29,329 --> 0:8:30,169
those who love him,

232
0:8:30,169 --> 0:8:31,649
so they don't make the same mistakes he did,

233
0:8:31,649 --> 0:8:32,93
and end up with regrets.

234
0:8:32,93 --> 0:8:34,21
The same goes for Confucius.

235
0:8:34,21 --> 0:8:36,37
Was I talking about the real Confucius himself?

236
0:8:36,37 --> 0:8:37,73
I was referring to Dong Zhongshu.

237
0:8:39,97 --> 0:8:42,11
I was talking about those pedantic scholars.

238
0:8:42,11 --> 0:8:43,46
Not Confucius himself.

239
0:8:43,46 --> 0:8:44,8
So when many people hear this,

240
0:8:44,8 --> 0:8:46,5
Rong Zhen says those from the 60s and 70s,

241
0:8:46,5 --> 0:8:47,98
You’re actually insulting us and the like,

242
0:8:47,98 --> 0:8:49,58
You’re at this age now,

243
0:8:49,58 --> 0:8:50,94
And you’re still so worked up about it.

244
0:8:50,94 --> 0:8:52,26
Don't you have the three highs?

245
0:8:52,26 --> 0:8:54,28
Don't you have high cholesterol and high blood pressure?

246
0:8:54,28 --> 0:8:55,3
Right?

247
0:8:55,3 --> 0:8:56,55
Don't you have diabetes?

248
0:8:56,55 --> 0:8:58,3
Don't you have prostatitis?

249
0:8:58,3 --> 0:8:59,55
A lot of issues are like this.

250
0:8:59,55 --> 0:9:1,75
Do you really have to compete with the younger generation?

251
0:9:1,75 --> 0:9:4,25
And this is a topic we're discussing among ourselves.

252
0:9:4,25 --> 0:9:5,79
Rather than putting it in the newspaper.

253
0:9:5,79 --> 0:9:6,83
Then talking about the post-60s generation

254
0:9:6,83 --> 0:9:8,31
the post-70s generation being bad or something

255
0:9:8,31 --> 0:9:11,48
I wonder if there are more bad apples among you

256
0:9:11,48 --> 0:9:12,6
or more brainwashed ones

257
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:14,6
or if some people are just from your era

258
0:9:14,6 --> 0:9:15,0
Some people say

259
0:9:15,0 --> 0:9:16,859
that in our time, we still have entrepreneurs

260
0:9:16,859 --> 0:9:18,659
Which era doesn't have entrepreneurs?

261
0:9:18,659 --> 0:9:19,259
Buddy

262
0:9:19,259 --> 0:9:20,519
Are you?

263
0:9:20,519 --> 0:9:21,759
You're not though.

264
0:9:21,759 --> 0:9:22,659
You need to power up.

265
0:9:22,659 --> 0:9:24,339
Then you could become a business owner.

266
0:9:24,339 --> 0:9:25,52
But you're not though.

267
0:9:25,52 --> 0:9:27,48
So you have little influence.

268
0:9:27,48 --> 0:9:29,849
To me, you're nothing.

269
0:9:29,849 --> 0:9:32,649
So let's talk about what a true fan is like.

270
0:9:32,649 --> 0:9:34,549
What defines a true paying follower?

271
0:9:34,549 --> 0:9:35,689
What kind of person are you?

272
0:9:37,4 --> 0:9:38,22
gave others money

273
0:9:38,22 --> 0:9:41,6
gave others a real boost of energy

274
0:9:41,6 --> 0:9:42,339
only then will they respect you

275
0:9:42,339 --> 0:9:44,559
So that's the way of it

276
0:9:44,559 --> 0:9:46,819
Why do I respect the post-60s so little

277
0:9:46,819 --> 0:9:47,459
What about the post-70s?

278
0:9:47,459 --> 0:9:49,19
Ah, what do you all think?

279
0:9:49,19 --> 0:9:51,55
Maybe it's because there's indeed Shi Guopeng

280
0:9:51,55 --> 0:9:53,29
Yuan Tengfei talks about human existence

281
0:9:53,29 --> 0:9:53,95
Of course, let's start with that

282
0:9:53,95 --> 0:9:56,21
Do you think I haven't bought any of Yuan Tengfei and Shi Guopeng's books?

283
0:9:56,21 --> 0:9:57,69
Oh, I have bought their books too

284
0:9:57,69 --> 0:10:0,3
When it comes to learning from others, I always focus on their strengths

285
0:10:0,3 --> 0:10:1,89
I always look for the best in others

286
0:10:1,89 --> 0:10:3,47
I always see the good in others

287
0:10:3,47 --> 0:10:5,13
Like how I have books by Yi Zhongtian at home

288
0:10:5,13 --> 0:10:8,29
You can see I have books by many authors at home

289
0:10:8,29 --> 0:10:9,57
These people's books

290
0:10:9,57 --> 0:10:13,87
Do I agree with every single one of their viewpoints?

291
0:10:13,87 --> 0:10:14,37
Right?

292
0:10:14,37 --> 0:10:15,39
That's not the case.

293
0:10:15,39 --> 0:10:16,83
But when it comes to a person

294
0:10:16,83 --> 0:10:20,69
When it comes to Yan Chongnian's books, do I have a lot to say about them?

295
0:10:20,69 --> 0:10:21,409
If you want to study someone

296
0:10:21,409 --> 0:10:22,689
You need to understand their work

297
0:10:22,689 --> 0:10:24,949
They can become a leading expert in their field

298
0:10:24,949 --> 0:10:26,37
He must have his own skills.

299
0:10:26,37 --> 0:10:28,77
I haven't bought any of Zhang Xuefeng's books, right?

300
0:10:28,77 --> 0:10:30,21
But when you say I agree,

301
0:10:30,21 --> 0:10:32,5
with Zhang Xuefeng's views on everything,

302
0:10:32,5 --> 0:10:34,1
his views on women's efforts in particular,

303
0:10:34,1 --> 0:10:35,74
I don't align with him, right?

304
0:10:35,74 --> 0:10:39,3
So it's not about being exactly the same as others,

305
0:10:39,3 --> 0:10:40,6
it's about finding common ground while respecting differences,

306
0:10:40,6 --> 0:10:41,9
and learning from each other's strengths to make up for our weaknesses.

307
0:10:41,9 --> 0:10:44,56
Being able to see people's strengths is truly important.

308
0:10:44,56 --> 0:10:45,98
So, in many cases,

309
0:10:45,98 --> 0:10:49,0
I'm talking to those of you who insulted me in the comments of my last video

310
0:10:49,0 --> 0:10:51,349
Actually, I was swept up by my own traffic.

311
0:10:51,349 --> 0:10:53,709
Every time you scold, every time you like

312
0:10:53,709 --> 0:10:54,709
every time you share it,

313
0:10:54,709 --> 0:10:55,189
every time you do something,

314
0:10:55,189 --> 0:10:57,65
you're helping to expand my influence.

315
0:10:57,65 --> 0:10:59,71
If you truly dislike such statements,

316
0:10:59,71 --> 0:11:1,84
You should just close it from the top right corner.

317
0:11:1,84 --> 0:11:4,2
And the official can approve it for me.

318
0:11:4,2 --> 0:11:6,28
If the official lets me speak for 45 years here,

319
0:11:6,28 --> 0:11:8,66
That proves my words have a market.

320
0:11:8,66 --> 0:11:10,43
I can influence a lot of people.

321
0:11:10,43 --> 0:11:12,83
Your words can't influence many people.

322
0:11:12,83 --> 0:11:14,11
So you only have a dozen followers

323
0:11:14,11 --> 0:11:15,47
You have fewer than a hundred followers.

324
0:11:15,47 --> 0:11:17,1
So your words carry little weight.

325
0:11:17,1 --> 0:11:19,59
So this is the fact you should accept.

326
0:11:19,59 --> 0:11:20,87
All these things.

327
0:11:20,87 --> 0:11:22,15
Don't always complain about them.

328
0:11:22,15 --> 0:11:24,15
I can't figure out what's up with the young people nowadays.

329
0:11:24,15 --> 0:11:25,72
I can't stand that.

330
0:11:25,72 --> 0:11:27,4
You're always criticizing me.

331
0:11:27,4 --> 0:11:29,92
Remember, this person is a big deal in China.

332
0:11:29,92 --> 0:11:31,7
Even if it's something happening in the world.

333
0:11:31,7 --> 0:11:34,98
Even if there's something you don't understand at all.

334
0:11:34,98 --> 0:11:37,3
You should also understand that they have their own audience.

335
0:11:37,3 --> 0:11:38,86
Just like a Gen X once told me,

336
0:11:38,86 --> 0:11:40,94
I don't get what today's kids are into with all this cosplay.

337
0:11:40,94 --> 0:11:42,4
What's the point of it?

338
0:11:42,4 --> 0:11:45,45
Well, if you don't understand, then you just don't understand.

339
0:11:45,45 --> 0:11:46,79
You've hit the nail on the head.

340
0:11:46,79 --> 0:11:47,98
You don't understand,

341
0:11:47,98 --> 0:11:50,3
it's because you're out of touch with the times.

342
0:11:50,3 --> 0:11:52,3
it's because you can't see through these things.

343
0:11:52,3 --> 0:11:55,66
And now, those who are making a mark in society are the post-80s generation.

344
0:11:55,66 --> 0:11:56,1
The post-90s generation.

345
0:11:56,1 --> 0:11:56,8
The post-00s generation.

346
0:11:56,8 --> 0:11:59,48
In a few years, I'll start criticizing the post-80s generation.

347
0:11:59,48 --> 0:12:2,77
Because by then, they will have become an obstacle to social progress.

348
0:12:2,77 --> 0:12:4,93
As a member of the post-80s generation,

349
0:12:4,93 --> 0:12:6,47
I am also an obstacle to progress.

350
0:12:6,47 --> 0:12:8,65
So I criticize myself along with them.

351
0:12:8,65 --> 0:12:11,599
Do you think I don't criticize myself often enough?

352
0:12:11,599 --> 0:12:13,839
I criticize myself a lot too

353
0:12:13,839 --> 0:12:14,799
Let me tell you

354
0:12:14,799 --> 0:12:15,89
Know yourself

355
0:12:15,89 --> 0:12:16,95
Understand the world

356
0:12:16,95 --> 0:12:17,81
Embrace all beings

357
0:12:17,81 --> 0:12:19,17
These are three realms

358
0:12:19,17 --> 0:12:21,15
Have you truly known yourself?

359
0:12:21,15 --> 0:12:22,349
Extend kindness to others

360
0:12:22,349 --> 0:12:25,449
Do you dare to confront your own ego?

361
0:12:25,449 --> 0:12:28,429
To break down the barriers brought by self-esteem

362
0:12:28,429 --> 0:12:32,29
If you can truly overcome these obstacles to this extent

363
0:12:32,29 --> 0:12:34,41
If you can truly understand to this depth

364
0:12:34,41 --> 0:12:35,77
Eliminate the ego

365
0:12:35,77 --> 0:12:38,19
Then you will truly see the greater self

366
0:12:38,19 --> 0:12:39,79
See the universe and all beings

367
0:12:39,79 --> 0:12:41,57
See yourself and your true self

368
0:12:41,57 --> 0:12:42,85
In fact, these are all the same

369
0:12:42,85 --> 0:12:44,21
The universe is also you

370
0:12:44,21 --> 0:12:45,25
All beings are also you

371
0:12:45,25 --> 0:12:46,21
You are also among all beings

372
0:12:46,21 --> 0:12:47,37
You are also yourself

373
0:12:47,37 --> 0:12:51,31
Often, some people reach a certain age

374
0:12:51,31 --> 0:12:54,979
I think it's still possible to catch up in your thirties and forties

375
0:12:54,979 --> 0:12:56,999
Or even in your sixties and seventies

376
0:12:56,999 --> 0:12:58,419
Or fifties and sixties

377
0:12:58,419 --> 0:13:0,699
There are still those with a childlike mindset

378
0:13:0,699 --> 0:13:3,2
Even after adolescence, they still have youthful aspirations

379
0:13:3,2 --> 0:13:5,64
If you care so much about face and self-respect,

380
0:13:5,64 --> 0:13:8,72
you'll end up achieving nothing in your life,

381
0:13:8,72 --> 0:13:11,24
amounting to nothing at all.

382
0:13:11,24 --> 0:13:12,54
Using this to describe you,

383
0:13:12,54 --> 0:13:13,38
is an insult to nothingness itself.

384
0:13:13,38 --> 0:13:15,28
You can't even understand a few harsh words.

385
0:13:15,6 --> 0:13:17,88
Are you the one who was verbally abused by Prime Minister Zhuge Liang until you spat blood?

386
0:13:21,9 --> 0:13:22,32
Is it

387
0:13:22,32 --> 0:13:23,22
Are you Wang Lang?

388
0:13:23,22 --> 0:13:23,72
Is that right

389
0:13:23,72 --> 0:13:25,8
You can't even bear a few harsh words

390
0:13:25,8 --> 0:13:27,99
Let alone something that doesn't concern you

391
0:13:27,99 --> 0:13:30,41
Why are you so eager to prove yourself?

392
0:13:30,41 --> 0:13:32,79
Didn't you just fall into my trap of communication studies?

393
0:13:32,79 --> 0:13:33,43
Buddy

394
0:13:33,43 --> 0:13:35,29
So these people are useless

395
0:13:35,29 --> 0:13:36,75
These people don't pay either.

396
0:13:36,75 --> 0:13:38,47
These people aren't my followers at all.

397
0:13:38,47 --> 0:13:39,98
Not even followed

398
0:13:39,98 --> 0:13:41,2
You either follow

399
0:13:41,2 --> 0:13:41,88
or pay,

400
0:13:41,88 --> 0:13:42,58
right?

401
0:13:42,58 --> 0:13:43,82
Either you don't even follow

402
0:13:43,82 --> 0:13:44,72
after all these years,

403
0:13:44,72 --> 0:13:46,16
Do you think you've given me the Triple Combo?

404
0:13:46,16 --> 0:13:47,24
I have to answer you

405
0:13:47,24 --> 0:13:48,46
Do you think you can give me a Triple Combo?

406
0:13:48,46 --> 0:13:49,47
You followed me

407
0:13:49,47 --> 0:13:50,71
Are we equals?

408
0:13:50,71 --> 0:13:52,9
We're not equals at all

409
0:13:52,9 --> 0:13:52,59
Buddy

410
0:13:52,59 --> 0:13:53,43
So, when it comes to it

411
0:13:53,43 --> 0:13:55,319
I won't pay you any attention

412
0:13:55,319 --> 0:13:56,559
I'll just use you

413
0:13:56,559 --> 0:13:57,659
and won't pay you any attention

414
0:13:57,659 --> 0:13:59,55
and when we get to the crucial moment

415
0:13:59,55 --> 0:14:3,21
China has always operated on both yin and yang principles simultaneously

416
0:14:3,21 --> 0:14:5,21
our high school

417
0:14:5,21 --> 0:14:7,1
our high school had very strict rules

418
0:14:7,1 --> 0:14:9,48
boys' hair couldn't be longer than one centimeter

419
0:14:9,48 --> 0:14:10,9
girls weren't allowed to wear makeup

420
0:14:10,9 --> 0:14:11,92
we couldn't have much of a life

421
0:14:11,92 --> 0:14:12,64
we couldn't do anything at all

422
0:14:12,64 --> 0:14:14,2
Unlike today's middle school students

423
0:14:14,2 --> 0:14:18,69
Of course, our school's academic performance was only average in Haidian District

424
0:14:18,69 --> 0:14:19,669
But our school had strict rules

425
0:14:19,669 --> 0:14:21,269
Why did our school have such strict rules?

426
0:14:21,269 --> 0:14:23,9
Because it was a special era

427
0:14:23,9 --> 0:14:26,56
Our school produced a particularly high number of delinquents

428
0:14:26,56 --> 0:14:28,44
These delinquents from our school

429
0:14:28,44 --> 0:14:30,4
If you take the time to look into it

430
0:14:30,4 --> 0:14:33,1
You can start by searching for Rongzhen High School on Baidu

431
0:14:33,1 --> 0:14:35,82
Then, over the decades, what this high school has been up to

432
0:14:35,82 --> 0:14:36,86
You'll find out

433
0:14:36,86 --> 0:14:37,7
So the school later tightened its rules

434
0:14:37,7 --> 0:14:39,78
But let me tell you

435
0:14:39,78 --> 0:14:41,24
The stricter a school is

436
0:14:41,24 --> 0:14:43,8
The greater the contrast

437
0:14:43,8 --> 0:14:44,46
The more rebellious people there are

438
0:14:44,46 --> 0:14:46,26
That's the characteristic of our school

439
0:14:47,5 --> 0:14:49,99
Well, our school has produced another talent, how should I say it

440
0:14:49,99 --> 0:14:53,85
Someone from the performance department has become the lead singer of a rock band

441
0:14:53,85 --> 0:14:55,19
It's all about death metal and such

442
0:14:55,19 --> 0:14:57,67
So, the more repressed, the more liberating it becomes

443
0:14:57,67 --> 0:15:1,17
In our year, it was the least romantic across the entire school

444
0:15:1,17 --> 0:15:3,9
There were all kinds of couples, but the least amount of dating

445
0:15:3,9 --> 0:15:6,469
But there was this girl in our year

446
0:15:6,469 --> 0:15:8,269
I knew her before

447
0:15:8,269 --> 0:15:12,69
She hasn't really talked to many people since high school

448
0:15:12,69 --> 0:15:14,31
She has generally avoided boys

449
0:15:14,31 --> 0:15:17,38
Later, she married her junior high school physical education teacher

450
0:15:17,38 --> 0:15:18,8
Based on my deduction

451
0:15:18,8 --> 0:15:20,34
This is my deduction

452
0:15:20,34 --> 0:15:21,38
I'm not slandering anyone

453
0:15:21,38 --> 0:15:22,4
Based on my deduction

454
0:15:22,4 --> 0:15:25,9
This girl was probably still a minor during her school days

455
0:15:25,9 --> 0:15:30,4
And she might have had some inappropriate relationship with the teacher

456
0:15:30,4 --> 0:15:31,4
But to talk about it

457
0:15:31,4 --> 0:15:32,48
He was the victim.

458
0:15:32,48 --> 0:15:35,329
This teacher turned out to be such a wolf in sheep's clothing.

459
0:15:35,329 --> 0:15:36,969
Although they ended up together later.

460
0:15:36,969 --> 0:15:38,45
They seem to be divorced now.

461
0:15:38,45 --> 0:15:40,53
But it was over this very incident.

462
0:15:40,53 --> 0:15:41,85
I've been talking about this all along.

463
0:15:41,85 --> 0:15:44,75
In our school, where the discipline is so strict.

464
0:15:44,75 --> 0:15:45,97
How could something like this happen?

465
0:15:45,97 --> 0:15:48,73
So, human nature is truly unpredictable.

466
0:15:48,73 --> 0:15:50,45
There's another teacher at our school

467
0:15:50,45 --> 0:15:52,3
who also got divorced

468
0:15:52,3 --> 0:15:53,15
and is now with a student

469
0:15:53,15 --> 0:15:54,19
so when we talk about it

470
0:15:54,19 --> 0:15:58,39
we say that the kind of thing that often happens at Japanese schools

471
0:15:58,39 --> 0:16:0,86
the kind of thing you see in adult films

472
0:16:0,86 --> 0:16:2,74
actually happens at our school

473
0:16:2,74 --> 0:16:4,66
of course, I'm not saying we spread gossip

474
0:16:4,66 --> 0:16:6,46
or use it to attack others

475
0:16:6,46 --> 0:16:6,94
Where are you going?

476
0:16:6,94 --> 0:16:9,42
You didn't know these two students at first

477
0:16:9,42 --> 0:16:11,6
What are these two people doing now?

478
0:16:11,6 --> 0:16:11,84
Where are they?

479
0:16:11,84 --> 0:16:12,66
To start with

480
0:16:12,66 --> 0:16:14,74
This was something from 20 years ago

481
0:16:14,74 --> 0:16:16,6
But we were all quite surprised back then

482
0:16:16,6 --> 0:16:17,66
How did you get married right after graduation?

483
0:16:17,66 --> 0:16:19,97
How did you end up marrying the teacher so soon after?

484
0:16:19,97 --> 0:16:21,93
How did the teacher get divorced from his wife?

485
0:16:21,93 --> 0:16:22,95
You two are together now?

486
0:16:22,95 --> 0:16:26,109
It's just that back then, there was a lot of gossip.

487
0:16:26,109 --> 0:16:27,909
They had to go through a lot of such pressure.

488
0:16:27,909 --> 0:16:29,489
But what I'm saying is,

489
0:16:29,489 --> 0:16:31,3
As a role model,

490
0:16:31,3 --> 0:16:33,3
If you're a college teacher,

491
0:16:33,3 --> 0:16:34,59
In some aspects,

492
0:16:34,59 --> 0:16:35,47
You marry a student.

493
0:16:35,47 --> 0:16:39,3
It's still somewhat possible, not too disgusting.

494
0:16:39,3 --> 0:16:40,17
You're a teacher at an art school.

495
0:16:40,17 --> 0:16:42,41
Or a regular middle school teacher.

496
0:16:42,41 --> 0:16:43,99
A junior or senior high school teacher.

497
0:16:43,99 --> 0:16:47,51
A school actually had this happen twice.

498
0:16:47,51 --> 0:16:51,23
Two teachers from the same year went to mess with students.

499
0:16:51,23 --> 0:16:52,51
It makes me feel really... I don't know what to say.

500
0:16:52,51 --> 0:16:53,59
Because they're minors.

501
0:16:53,59 --> 0:16:56,5
They don't have much judgment at that age.

502
0:16:56,5 --> 0:16:57,61
You can care about others

503
0:16:57,61 --> 0:16:58,53
You can love others

504
0:16:58,53 --> 0:16:59,51
You can tutor others

505
0:16:59,51 --> 0:17:0,93
You can follow others' growth

506
0:17:0,93 --> 0:17:2,13
But you bring someone home to marry

507
0:17:2,13 --> 0:17:3,1
What's going on here

508
0:17:3,1 --> 0:17:3,569
Right

509
0:17:3,569 --> 0:17:4,709
Isn't that a creepy old man

510
0:17:4,709 --> 0:17:5,689
So, to talk about it

511
0:17:5,689 --> 0:17:6,449
Often, you see,

512
0:17:6,449 --> 0:17:9,9
people say that the postgraduate entrance exam is tough.

513
0:17:9,9 --> 0:17:9,81
Regarding postgraduate studies,

514
0:17:9,81 --> 0:17:10,73
sometimes I hesitate to mention,

515
0:17:10,73 --> 0:17:12,81
things about the academic circle to you.

516
0:17:12,81 --> 0:17:13,909
Of course,

517
0:17:13,909 --> 0:17:15,949
many postgraduate supervisors are not inappropriate in their behavior.

518
0:17:15,949 --> 0:17:17,229
You folks from the 60s,

519
0:17:17,229 --> 0:17:18,589
70s, and even the 50s,

520
0:17:18,589 --> 0:17:19,709
Many people in the circle of knowledge

521
0:17:19,709 --> 0:17:21,109
Many so-called people in the cultural circle

522
0:17:21,109 --> 0:17:23,61
Do you not feel tempted to touch a young girl's thigh when you see it?

523
0:17:23,61 --> 0:17:25,67
So on the surface, you appear to be a role model

524
0:17:25,67 --> 0:17:26,89
How do you appear on the surface?

525
0:17:26,89 --> 0:17:28,25
How do I appear on the surface?

526
0:17:28,25 --> 0:17:29,86
I am the one who supervises China

527
0:17:31,52 --> 0:17:32,94
Then you should be touching your students' thighs

528
0:17:32,94 --> 0:17:33,86
Touching students' thighs, right?

529
0:17:33,86 --> 0:17:34,48
Isn't that right?

530
0:17:34,48 --> 0:17:35,16
You said it

531
0:17:35,16 --> 0:17:35,76
For the sake of art

532
0:17:35,76 --> 0:17:36,88
So in many cases

533
0:17:36,88 --> 0:17:38,7
China is a place of yin and yang

534
0:17:38,7 --> 0:17:42,8
Precisely because we often advocate for moral righteousness

535
0:17:42,8 --> 0:17:43,34
Full of moral righteousness

536
0:17:43,34 --> 0:17:46,6
So hypocrites can easily gain the upper hand

537
0:17:46,6 --> 0:17:48,78
That's why I use this kind of value system

538
0:17:48,78 --> 0:17:50,72
Just like the Machiavellianism you mentioned

539
0:17:50,72 --> 0:17:52,4
We appear to be bad on the surface

540
0:17:52,4 --> 0:17:55,9
But in reality, we are far from being true villains

541
0:17:55,9 --> 0:17:58,279
We are just not hypocritical

542
0:17:58,279 --> 0:18:0,859
Teach people to be genuine

543
0:18:0,859 --> 0:18:2,459
To be a real person

544
0:18:2,459 --> 0:18:3,939
To seek the true path

545
0:18:3,939 --> 0:18:4,999
To be truly constant and firm

546
0:18:4,999 --> 0:18:6,62
In many cases, it's like this

547
0:18:6,62 --> 0:18:7,74
So essentially speaking

548
0:18:7,74 --> 0:18:10,28
What I study is Eastern philosophy

549
0:18:10,28 --> 0:18:11,74
Indeed, I am sharp and true

550
0:18:11,74 --> 0:18:12,9
So these things

551
0:18:12,9 --> 0:18:15,56
I have a strong pursuit of truth

552
0:18:15,56 --> 0:18:17,0
But I can be unrestrained and free

553
0:18:17,0 --> 0:18:17,82
I can be unrestrained and free

554
0:18:17,82 --> 0:18:19,36
Why do I add little sisters on WeChat

555
0:18:19,36 --> 0:18:20,76
Because I am a true and sharp person

556
0:18:20,76 --> 0:18:22,7
I must tell you

557
0:18:22,7 --> 0:18:23,29
I want to add you on WeChat

558
0:18:23,29 --> 0:18:24,99
I might have all sorts of intentions

559
0:18:24,99 --> 0:18:28,62
If you're not afraid and you also have intentions towards me

560
0:18:28,62 --> 0:18:31,27
Then we can collude and act in concert

561
0:18:31,27 --> 0:18:35,1
If you are a very pure person

562
0:18:35,1 --> 0:18:37,77
You don't want too much of this kind of thing

563
0:18:37,77 --> 0:18:40,48
Then I naturally will demote you

564
0:18:40,48 --> 0:18:42,6
But there are some hypocritical people

565
0:18:42,6 --> 0:18:42,66
Not at all

566
0:18:42,66 --> 0:18:44,16
Let me tell you about aesthetics

567
0:18:44,16 --> 0:18:46,22
Let's discuss art

568
0:18:46,22 --> 0:18:48,62
So the distinction between truth and falsehood is usually like this

569
0:18:48,62 --> 0:18:51,56
But falsehood often exists in the world in the form of truth

570
0:18:51,56 --> 0:18:53,99
And true people often use falsehood

571
0:18:53,99 --> 0:18:56,29
Using good and evil to represent themselves

572
0:18:56,29 --> 0:18:57,19
To proclaim themselves

573
0:18:57,19 --> 0:19:0,5
Because we are still far from the true path of sainthood in our hearts

574
0:19:0,5 --> 0:19:3,38
So I don't consider myself a perfect person

575
0:19:3,38 --> 0:19:5,62
But I pursue the true path

576
0:19:5,62 --> 0:19:6,96
I pursue true beauty

577
0:19:6,96 --> 0:19:8,4
True goodness

578
0:19:8,4 --> 0:19:11,88
But I am still far from those truly pure and good people

579
0:19:11,88 --> 0:19:13,14
But what do we call this

580
0:19:13,14 --> 0:19:14,68
We call this chaotic good

581
0:19:14,68 --> 0:19:16,889
Ha, we are not neutral good

582
0:19:16,889 --> 0:19:18,289
Nor are we lawful good

583
0:19:18,289 --> 0:19:19,769
We are chaotic good

584
0:19:19,769 --> 0:19:21,329
People are different from each other

585
0:19:21,329 --> 0:19:24,159
So in the yin and yang of life, everyone should understand

586
0:19:24,159 --> 0:19:27,64
This is what is necessary to survive in Chinese society
