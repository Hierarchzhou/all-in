1
0:0:1,66 --> 0:0:3,72
The other day, I ran into a high school classmate.

2
0:0:3,72 --> 0:0:6,24
We discussed a lot of things.

3
0:0:6,24 --> 0:0:8,78
He really can't stand what I'm doing with videos now.

4
0:0:8,78 --> 0:0:12,3
He said, 'Isn't what you're doing just the same as the thick-skinned and black-hearted teachings of the 80s and 90s?'

5
0:0:12,3 --> 0:0:14,9
I responded, 'What you're saying is...'

6
0:0:14,9 --> 0:0:17,9
I'm saying you actually don't understand the difference between individualism and selfishness.

7
0:0:17,9 --> 0:0:18,91
They are two different things.

8
0:0:18,91 --> 0:0:19,99
Let me start by saying,

9
0:0:19,99 --> 0:0:22,97
The debate over individualism and collectivism in our country

10
0:0:22,97 --> 0:0:26,62
I recommend everyone to read Hayek's 'The Road to Serfdom'.

11
0:0:26,62 --> 0:0:28,7
When it comes to collectivism and such concepts,

12
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:30,8
I'm not particularly fond of them.

13
0:0:30,8 --> 0:0:33,18
We have our DPRK friend here to keep things in check.

14
0:0:33,18 --> 0:0:34,2
So, to put it this way,

15
0:0:34,2 --> 0:0:35,72
We talk about the period after Reform and Opening up,

16
0:0:35,72 --> 0:0:38,0
Chinese society has been very vibrant and prosperous.

17
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:39,68
Recently, we have a new topic on the table,

18
0:0:39,68 --> 0:0:42,82
which is how to manage the new relationship between China and the U.S.

19
0:0:42,82 --> 0:0:45,2
Our country has actually set the tone in this area

20
0:0:45,2 --> 0:0:48,64
We hope everyone can talk more about the good things between China and the U.S.

21
0:0:48,64 --> 0:0:49,82
Friendly stories

22
0:0:49,82 --> 0:0:53,289
We don’t want to keep stirring up such confrontations

23
0:0:53,289 --> 0:0:54,149
Or divisions

24
0:0:54,149 --> 0:0:56,9
This competition of ideologies

25
0:0:56,9 --> 0:0:57,449
This type of person doesn't like to get involved in such things.

26
0:0:57,449 --> 0:0:58,78
Everything should be prioritized based on the bigger picture

27
0:0:58,78 --> 0:1:1,26
We should still focus more on telling positive stories between China and the U.S.

28
0:1:1,26 --> 0:1:2,66
Especially recently, with the major confrontation between China and the U.S.

29
0:1:2,66 --> 0:1:5,3
people have found that the people on both sides can be friendly to each other.

30
0:1:5,3 --> 0:1:6,58
When we talk about Western civilization,

31
0:1:6,58 --> 0:1:10,29
It's a place where individualism is highly prevalent.

32
0:1:10,29 --> 0:1:11,27
Some people say,

33
0:1:11,27 --> 0:1:13,37
these individuals are selfish and self-centered.

34
0:1:13,37 --> 0:1:14,17
How so?

35
0:1:14,17 --> 0:1:15,41
They don’t take care of the collective.

36
0:1:15,41 --> 0:1:16,67
In what ways?

37
0:1:18,55 --> 0:1:20,86
I'm asking you, what should modern society look like?

38
0:1:20,86 --> 0:1:22,9
And how did the prototype of modern society come about?

39
0:1:22,9 --> 0:1:25,1
It all started with the development of individualism.

40
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:26,3
We talk about individualism

41
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:26,94
Humanism

42
0:1:26,94 --> 0:1:27,95
Individualism,

43
0:1:27,95 --> 0:1:30,23
many things aren't simply equated with others.

44
0:1:30,23 --> 0:1:32,15
It's not just about taking care of ourselves,

45
0:1:32,15 --> 0:1:34,55
we also explore the direction in which individuals should develop.

46
0:1:34,55 --> 0:1:36,15
We won't be catering to the group anymore

47
0:1:36,15 --> 0:1:39,61
On the contrary, if you don't understand your own worth

48
0:1:39,61 --> 0:1:42,55
You can't maximize the value of your life

49
0:1:42,55 --> 0:1:44,33
How can you take care of others then?

50
0:1:44,33 --> 0:1:45,38
Right?

51
0:1:45,38 --> 0:1:49,26
So many Chinese people live their entire lives in the shadow of others

52
0:1:49,26 --> 0:1:51,1
Living in the shadow of their own parents

53
0:1:51,1 --> 0:1:52,84
Living under the judgment of others

54
0:1:52,84 --> 0:1:55,119
Always thinking about this, isn't it?

55
0:1:55,119 --> 0:1:56,319
To return home in glory

56
0:1:56,319 --> 0:1:58,36
Always wanting to stand out

57
0:1:58,36 --> 0:2:0,8
Then fearing what others might say

58
0:2:0,8 --> 0:2:1,36
So life becomes exhausting

59
0:2:1,36 --> 0:2:3,88
You'll find that within the social consciousness of a small peasant society,

60
0:2:3,88 --> 0:2:4,96
Those feudal notions

61
0:2:4,96 --> 0:2:6,97
Many things are not worth promoting

62
0:2:6,97 --> 0:2:9,23
Because it used to be a rural society

63
0:2:9,23 --> 0:2:10,89
Your travel was slow with carriages and horses

64
0:2:10,89 --> 0:2:12,709
A letter can be cherished for a lifetime.

65
0:2:12,709 --> 0:2:14,109
When it comes to many things,

66
0:2:14,109 --> 0:2:16,149
they don't move at the fast pace of modern society.

67
0:2:16,149 --> 0:2:19,69
In the context of living in a modern big city,

68
0:2:19,69 --> 0:2:23,7
an individual can feel insignificant in a city.

69
0:2:23,7 --> 0:2:25,4
After all, Beijing has over 30 million people.

70
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:27,28
What am I, Rongzhen, in comparison?

71
0:2:27,28 --> 0:2:27,68
Right?

72
0:2:27,68 --> 0:2:28,9
So many things are like this.

73
0:2:28,9 --> 0:2:32,37
Being a web celebrity in a big city is somewhat insignificant.

74
0:2:32,37 --> 0:2:33,77
But in a smaller place,

75
0:2:33,77 --> 0:2:35,13
if someone becomes famous,

76
0:2:35,13 --> 0:2:36,53
everyone pays a lot of attention.

77
0:2:36,53 --> 0:2:37,21
That's how it is.

78
0:2:37,21 --> 0:2:37,89
So many people

79
0:2:37,89 --> 0:2:41,13
wonder why web celebrities don't want to stay in Beijing anymore,

80
0:2:41,13 --> 0:2:42,13
they prefer to return to their hometowns,

81
0:2:42,13 --> 0:2:44,25
or move to smaller cities.

82
0:2:44,25 --> 0:2:45,9
That's how it is.

83
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:47,72
Many Beijing UPloaders have moved to Shanghai since then.

84
0:2:47,72 --> 0:2:48,28
Exactly.

85
0:2:48,28 --> 0:2:50,26
Because in Beijing, you don't stand out.

86
0:2:50,26 --> 0:2:52,52
There are so many talented people in Beijing.

87
0:2:52,52 --> 0:2:53,12
Right?

88
0:2:53,12 --> 0:2:55,36
So often we talk about individualism

89
0:2:55,36 --> 0:2:57,6
You improve yourself.

90
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:58,88
The pursuit of self-improvement

91
0:2:58,88 --> 0:3:0,88
The commonly mentioned Taoist philosophy

92
0:3:0,88 --> 0:3:3,86
cultivating immortality and spiritual practice

93
0:3:3,86 --> 0:3:5,49
making oneself better

94
0:3:5,49 --> 0:3:6,45
you will understand

95
0:3:6,45 --> 0:3:7,35
only when you are well

96
0:3:7,35 --> 0:3:8,13
can others be well

97
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:9,79
because we judge others by our own standards

98
0:3:9,79 --> 0:3:11,829
many things are hard to gauge

99
0:3:11,829 --> 0:3:13,809
in addition to our rural society

100
0:3:13,809 --> 0:3:15,849
Many small farmers have a rather strong mindset.

101
0:3:15,849 --> 0:3:17,89
Like what kind of car you drive,

102
0:3:17,89 --> 0:3:19,17
what kind of house you live in,

103
0:3:19,17 --> 0:3:20,17
whether you’ve renovated it or not,

104
0:3:20,17 --> 0:3:21,33
what clothes you wear,

105
0:3:21,33 --> 0:3:23,1
all these things are for show,

106
0:3:23,1 --> 0:3:25,51
not a reflection of your true inner feelings.

107
0:3:25,51 --> 0:3:27,21
Even your child’s academic performance,

108
0:3:27,21 --> 0:3:28,47
and how much money you make.

109
0:3:28,47 --> 0:3:30,61
So, it's that time of the year again for our annual celebration

110
0:3:30,61 --> 0:3:31,9
This period

111
0:3:31,9 --> 0:3:32,269
I want to share with everyone

112
0:3:32,269 --> 0:3:34,949
the comparison thief of joy

113
0:3:34,949 --> 0:3:39,79
comparing these things can rob you of all your joy

114
0:3:39,79 --> 0:3:41,47
you keep comparing yourself with others

115
0:3:41,47 --> 0:3:43,19
I have 600,000 followers.

116
0:3:43,19 --> 0:3:45,51
I have one million followers, you know, one million.

117
0:3:45,51 --> 0:3:46,75
I still have three million followers.

118
0:3:46,75 --> 0:3:47,75
Let's aim for 3 million followers.

119
0:3:47,75 --> 0:3:48,959
There are still 10 million followers.

120
0:3:48,959 --> 0:3:49,939
You're always comparing

121
0:3:49,939 --> 0:3:51,739
Then what about the achievements you've made

122
0:3:51,739 --> 0:3:53,839
Do you have to be the top to feel good

123
0:3:53,839 --> 0:3:54,859
Only then do you feel satisfied

124
0:3:54,859 --> 0:3:57,459
I was the first person on Bilibili to receive the Power Up badge.

125
0:3:57,459 --> 0:3:59,99
Should I be overjoyed

126
0:3:59,99 --> 0:3:59,859
Should I be complacent

127
0:3:59,859 --> 0:4:1,78
It's not about being arrogant in victory or dejected in defeat

128
0:4:1,78 --> 0:4:2,78
I've been telling you this every day

129
0:4:2,78 --> 0:4:3,98
What's going on with you

130
0:4:3,98 --> 0:4:4,86
You should be modest and cautious

131
0:4:4,86 --> 0:4:5,42
Not proud or impatient

132
0:4:5,42 --> 0:4:7,3
And when you're happy about your achievements

133
0:4:7,3 --> 0:4:8,69
You shouldn't be unhappy

134
0:4:8,69 --> 0:4:10,97
Someone else might have achieved even more than you

135
0:4:10,97 --> 0:4:11,89
You shouldn't let that make you unhappy

136
0:4:11,89 --> 0:4:12,95
I got accepted into Renmin University.

137
0:4:12,95 --> 0:4:15,31
But you know, some people get into Tsinghua or Peking University.

138
0:4:15,31 --> 0:4:16,89
You'll find that your parents,

139
0:4:16,89 --> 0:4:19,47
and the people around you all have this kind of mindset,

140
0:4:19,47 --> 0:4:21,45
this elitist way of thinking.

141
0:4:21,45 --> 0:4:23,87
Coupled with a deeply ingrained peasant mentality, it's really scary.

142
0:4:23,87 --> 0:4:24,75
If I don't become the top student,

143
0:4:24,75 --> 0:4:26,51
then I'm not cut out for academics in this life.

144
0:4:26,51 --> 0:4:27,31
I won't be the champion.

145
0:4:27,31 --> 0:4:29,7
I guess I'm not destined to be a sports star in this life.

146
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:30,55
I can only do the bare minimum, then.

147
0:4:30,55 --> 0:4:31,9
Is that how it is?

148
0:4:31,9 --> 0:4:32,74
Oh, is that how it is?

149
0:4:32,74 --> 0:4:34,28
Is that how the world works?

150
0:4:34,28 --> 0:4:35,88
The world is full of diversity.

151
0:4:35,88 --> 0:4:38,8
The world offers many opportunities to many people.

152
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:40,26
So, in the context of the past,

153
0:4:40,26 --> 0:4:41,54
suppress individualism

154
0:4:41,54 --> 0:4:42,58
suppress Humanism

155
0:4:42,58 --> 0:4:43,48
Suppressing the humanities

156
0:4:43,48 --> 0:4:44,16
Suppressing this thing

157
0:4:44,16 --> 0:4:45,6
That's taking the old Soviet path

158
0:4:45,6 --> 0:4:46,2
It's completely useless

159
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:47,18
The Soviet Union is gone

160
0:4:47,18 --> 0:4:48,28
The Soviet Union collapsed

161
0:4:48,28 --> 0:4:50,34
The Soviet Union no longer exists

162
0:4:50,34 --> 0:4:51,7
Think more clearly

163
0:4:51,7 --> 0:4:52,98
Don't swerve so much.

164
0:4:52,98 --> 0:4:55,28
Think deeply about what's really going on with you.

165
0:4:55,28 --> 0:4:56,18
Why did you do that?

166
0:4:56,18 --> 0:4:56,54
Why?

167
0:4:56,54 --> 0:4:57,26
Now, let me tell you.

168
0:4:57,26 --> 0:5:0,42
Pure science can't solve sociological issues.

169
0:5:0,42 --> 0:5:1,86
Humanistic elements.

170
0:5:1,86 --> 0:5:2,38
The spirit.

171
0:5:2,38 --> 0:5:4,16
The spiritual pursuits of the people.

172
0:5:4,16 --> 0:5:6,24
Only the humanities can solve it

173
0:5:6,24 --> 0:5:7,2
Such as sociology

174
0:5:7,2 --> 0:5:7,6
Political science

175
0:5:7,6 --> 0:5:8,0
historiography

176
0:5:8,0 --> 0:5:9,8
And international relations

177
0:5:9,8 --> 0:5:11,5
We didn't pay enough attention to these in the past

178
0:5:11,5 --> 0:5:13,22
Including social psychology

179
0:5:13,22 --> 0:5:15,14
These fields like sociology should be studied

180
0:5:15,14 --> 0:5:18,709
If you don't study them, others' external theories will take over

181
0:5:18,709 --> 0:5:19,809
the upper hand in the public opinion field

182
0:5:19,809 --> 0:5:20,569
Is that possible?

183
0:5:20,569 --> 0:5:21,21
Right?

184
0:5:21,21 --> 0:5:22,99
So we deal with a few boxing influencers

185
0:5:22,99 --> 0:5:24,73
Can the birth rate really bounce back?

186
0:5:24,73 --> 0:5:25,61
Is that how it works?

187
0:5:25,61 --> 0:5:29,61
It's not that we overly emphasize collectivism all the time.

188
0:5:29,61 --> 0:5:31,9
Not focused on individualism

189
0:5:31,9 --> 0:5:34,78
Individualism should be developed alongside collectivism.

190
0:5:34,78 --> 0:5:37,26
Neither idealism nor materialism is entirely correct.

191
0:5:37,26 --> 0:5:40,22
It should be the path of moderation and balance.

192
0:5:40,22 --> 0:5:41,78
So I really dislike Confucianism.

193
0:5:41,78 --> 0:5:43,6
But the doctrine of the mean is not wrong.

194
0:5:43,6 --> 0:5:45,44
The doctrine of the mean is absolutely correct.

195
0:5:45,44 --> 0:5:46,74
Inclusiveness and diversity.

196
0:5:46,74 --> 0:5:49,3
Sino-American cooperation can achieve great things.

197
0:5:49,3 --> 0:5:51,28
The humanities and sciences can sit side by side.

198
0:5:51,28 --> 0:5:53,12
Can we integrate Eastern and Western knowledge?

199
0:5:53,12 --> 0:5:54,52
Can we avoid overemphasizing literature?

200
0:5:54,52 --> 0:5:55,26
Or overemphasizing rituals?

201
0:5:55,26 --> 0:5:56,6
We should balance literature and science.

202
0:5:56,6 --> 0:5:59,74
Can we take the best from both China and the U.S.?

203
0:5:59,74 --> 0:6:2,34
In fact, The New China also learned from the Soviet Union.

204
0:6:2,34 --> 0:6:3,54
and also from the United States.

205
0:6:3,54 --> 0:6:4,98
We've learned a lot.

206
0:6:4,98 --> 0:6:7,86
Many aspects of the Reform and Opening up have been learned from the West for a long time.

207
0:6:7,86 --> 0:6:10,26
We learned a lot during the New Culture Movement era.

208
0:6:10,26 --> 0:6:12,86
In the past, the United States was seen as a relatively good example among Western powers.

209
0:6:12,86 --> 0:6:14,97
a relatively positive state.

210
0:6:16,65 --> 0:6:17,9
Right?

211
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:19,41
So, we shouldn't overcorrect on so many things.

212
0:6:19,41 --> 0:6:20,97
We shouldn’t think about everything in such a way.

213
0:6:20,97 --> 0:6:22,26
Always causing trouble with others.

214
0:6:22,26 --> 0:6:23,36
Going down together in a blaze of glory.

215
0:6:23,36 --> 0:6:25,66
And then making it impossible to get along with others.

216
0:6:25,66 --> 0:6:27,3
Just part ways.

217
0:6:27,3 --> 0:6:28,5
Is that how he lives?

218
0:6:28,5 --> 0:6:29,87
Is that the culture?

219
0:6:29,87 --> 0:6:31,83
So many things are like this.

220
0:6:31,83 --> 0:6:32,27
I said it.

221
0:6:32,27 --> 0:6:33,27
We need to read Marx,

222
0:6:33,27 --> 0:6:34,89
and also take industry courses.

223
0:6:34,89 --> 0:6:36,35
Each has its limitations.

224
0:6:36,35 --> 0:6:37,81
Each has its historical context.

225
0:6:37,81 --> 0:6:40,57
Only by deeply Sinicizing it,

226
0:6:40,57 --> 0:6:42,95
We'll proceed based on our realistic approach.

227
0:6:42,95 --> 0:6:46,57
The various lessons and experiences from the Chinese revolution are also important.

228
0:6:46,57 --> 0:6:48,95
We need to revise them before moving forward.

229
0:6:48,95 --> 0:6:49,43
Of course.

230
0:6:49,43 --> 0:6:50,91
Can you just read Hayek?

231
0:6:50,91 --> 0:6:53,71
Just reading Hayek suggests that the market is the solution to all problems.

232
0:6:53,71 --> 0:6:54,62
That's it.

233
0:6:54,62 --> 0:6:57,3
The United States today is following Hayek's path.

234
0:6:57,3 --> 0:6:58,419
Right?

235
0:6:58,419 --> 0:7:0,279
And when it comes to collectivism, there are certain aspects to consider.

236
0:7:0,279 --> 0:7:1,619
if it ends up like the Soviet Union

237
0:7:1,619 --> 0:7:2,559
is that really right?

238
0:7:2,559 --> 0:7:4,299
The economy also collapsed, which was clearly wrong

239
0:7:4,299 --> 0:7:6,289
So, we shouldn’t overcorrect

240
0:7:8,989 --> 0:7:11,89
you shouldn’t lean too far left

241
0:7:11,89 --> 0:7:12,28
or too far right

242
0:7:12,28 --> 0:7:13,36
be moderate

243
0:7:13,36 --> 0:7:18,91
listen to both sides, focus on both technology and spirit

244
0:7:18,91 --> 0:7:21,89
Cultivating and advancing in technology can go hand in hand.

245
0:7:21,89 --> 0:7:23,17
Balancing arts and sciences is important.

246
0:7:23,17 --> 0:7:24,43
We can excel in both China and the U.S.

247
0:7:24,43 --> 0:7:25,39
No problem at all.

248
0:7:25,39 --> 0:7:25,87
Right?

249
0:7:25,87 --> 0:7:27,57
We're not planning to film Journey to the West.

250
0:7:27,57 --> 0:7:29,789
That's just how many things work.

251
0:7:29,789 --> 0:7:31,769
So we shouldn't overcorrect.

252
0:7:31,769 --> 0:7:32,989
Some things are just like that.

253
0:7:32,989 --> 0:7:34,489
We can't say it's for collectivism.

254
0:7:34,489 --> 0:7:36,29
We completely abandon individualism.

255
0:7:36,29 --> 0:7:38,359
and individuals just fade away

256
0:7:38,359 --> 0:7:39,139
That's not the case

257
0:7:39,139 --> 0:7:40,599
If you're from the seventies

258
0:7:40,599 --> 0:7:40,959
or the sixties

259
0:7:40,959 --> 0:7:41,639
you can do that

260
0:7:41,639 --> 0:7:41,999
or the eighties

261
0:7:41,999 --> 0:7:42,359
or the nineties

262
0:7:42,359 --> 0:7:43,399
Can the post-00s really do that?

263
0:7:43,399 --> 0:7:43,94
Right?

264
0:7:43,94 --> 0:7:45,46
The post-80s are the generation bridging the gap.

265
0:7:45,46 --> 0:7:46,82
We've really had it tough.

266
0:7:46,82 --> 0:7:48,24
We actually get the most criticism.

267
0:7:48,24 --> 0:7:50,28
And we didn't get to enjoy much good stuff.

268
0:7:50,28 --> 0:7:50,88
The post-90s.

269
0:7:50,88 --> 0:7:52,16
The post-00s don't have to carry that burden anymore.

270
0:7:52,16 --> 0:7:53,52
They don't have to bear that weight.

271
0:7:53,52 --> 0:7:55,1
Why should anyone carry the burden of history?

272
0:7:55,1 --> 0:7:56,88
Why should anyone carry the burden of history?

273
0:7:56,88 --> 0:7:57,28
Right?

274
0:7:57,28 --> 0:7:58,44
They have a new starting point.

275
0:7:58,44 --> 0:7:59,9
A new beginning is just like that.

276
0:7:59,9 --> 0:8:0,9
As he grew up,

277
0:8:0,9 --> 0:8:1,86
China had already become strong.

278
0:8:1,86 --> 0:8:3,32
Of course, he doesn’t have to carry it.

279
0:8:3,32 --> 0:8:6,72
All the scar literature from the Heshang generation

280
0:8:6,72 --> 0:8:7,42
He doesn't need to

281
0:8:7,42 --> 0:8:8,46
He's starting anew

282
0:8:8,46 --> 0:8:9,26
He's different

283
0:8:9,26 --> 0:8:10,82
In today's China

284
0:8:10,82 --> 0:8:12,18
We talk about a hundred schools of thought contending

285
0:8:12,18 --> 0:8:13,5
A hundred flowers blooming is the best

286
0:8:16,56 --> 0:8:17,68
When it comes to many things

287
0:8:17,68 --> 0:8:18,32
You are in America.

288
0:8:18,32 --> 0:8:19,92
There are certain things you really can't do

289
0:8:19,92 --> 0:8:21,17
It can't be said that criticism is off-limits

290
0:8:21,17 --> 0:8:22,45
because of the banner of political correctness

291
0:8:22,45 --> 0:8:23,27
there's also PC

292
0:8:23,27 --> 0:8:23,95
right?

293
0:8:23,95 --> 0:8:24,81
Moving on

294
0:8:24,81 --> 0:8:25,85
but it's not the case here

295
0:8:25,85 --> 0:8:27,53
PC is illegal here

296
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:29,99
so a lot of things are like this

297
0:8:29,99 --> 0:8:32,61
there's not much overly controversial stuff to talk about

298
0:8:32,61 --> 0:8:34,3
There's nothing too special about it

299
0:8:34,3 --> 0:8:35,83
Of course, if you raise a big banner

300
0:8:35,83 --> 0:8:37,569
there will definitely be people who attack you

301
0:8:37,569 --> 0:8:38,789
but regardless

302
0:8:38,789 --> 0:8:40,409
Individualism is not a bad thing.

303
0:8:40,409 --> 0:8:42,819
developing oneself has never been a bad thing

304
0:8:42,819 --> 0:8:43,899
it's always been like that

305
0:8:43,899 --> 0:8:44,619
Hayek

306
0:8:44,619 --> 0:8:47,699
he emphasized some of his ideas from his time

307
0:8:47,699 --> 0:8:50,26
So you need to understand his things to be inclusive

308
0:8:50,26 --> 0:8:52,12
So everyone must understand

309
0:8:52,12 --> 0:8:54,18
We must understand both heaven and hell

310
0:8:54,18 --> 0:8:56,14
We must understand the religions of all places

311
0:8:56,14 --> 0:8:58,12
So, you dislike religion.

312
0:8:58,12 --> 0:8:59,8
You should study religion even more

313
0:8:59,8 --> 0:9:0,72
You dislike history

314
0:9:0,72 --> 0:9:1,88
You should study history

315
0:9:1,88 --> 0:9:3,48
You dislike these humanities subjects

316
0:9:3,48 --> 0:9:5,23
You should focus on the humanities.

317
0:9:5,23 --> 0:9:7,63
You have a good grasp of both areas.

318
0:9:7,63 --> 0:9:9,44
Skills never weigh you down.

319
0:9:9,44 --> 0:9:10,62
But it’s not enough to dabble in them.

320
0:9:10,62 --> 0:9:13,48
Sometimes you need to apply engineering thinking to solve social issues.

321
0:9:13,48 --> 0:9:14,8
Would that work?

322
0:9:14,8 --> 0:9:15,56
That would be chaos.

323
0:9:15,56 --> 0:9:17,92
Many issues involve public sentiment.

324
0:9:17,92 --> 0:9:19,86
It's essential to be familiar with communication studies.

325
0:9:19,86 --> 0:9:20,58
Journalism

326
0:9:20,58 --> 0:9:21,96
some aspects of psychology

327
0:9:21,96 --> 0:9:23,94
especially some aspects of sociology

328
0:9:23,94 --> 0:9:25,2
you can truly encounter

329
0:9:25,2 --> 0:9:26,38
you can't just say anything

330
0:9:26,38 --> 0:9:27,48
Let's come up with an algorithm

331
0:9:27,48 --> 0:9:29,82
and then eliminate those below 84%

332
0:9:29,82 --> 0:9:30,77
We'll all get rid of them

333
0:9:30,77 --> 0:9:32,1
Is that how it works?'

334
0:9:32,1 --> 0:9:32,45
Is that right?

335
0:9:32,45 --> 0:9:33,65
So, when it comes to some things,

336
0:9:33,65 --> 0:9:35,43
we shouldn't overcorrect,

337
0:9:35,43 --> 0:9:38,21
using these methods to tackle every problem.

338
0:9:38,21 --> 0:9:41,47
Speaking of the cooperation between China and the U.S. today,

339
0:9:41,47 --> 0:9:42,67
there's a lot that can be done.

340
0:9:42,67 --> 0:9:44,97
There are many wonderful stories to tell.

341
0:9:44,97 --> 0:9:48,96
For many people, the U.S. is a completely different place,

342
0:9:48,96 --> 0:9:51,3
and today, let's talk about it.

343
0:9:51,3 --> 0:9:53,68
Chinese people are quite familiar with American culture.

344
0:9:53,68 --> 0:9:55,96
When it comes to its culture and geography, many aspects are well-known.

345
0:9:55,96 --> 0:9:58,14
Through cultural exports, there's a good understanding of it.

346
0:9:58,14 --> 0:9:59,58
Many aspects of the other side are known.

347
0:9:59,58 --> 0:10:0,58
Like today, for example.

348
0:10:0,58 --> 0:10:1,9
There are many things on Xiaohongshu.

349
0:10:1,9 --> 0:10:4,329
People are starting to make egg custard now.

350
0:10:4,329 --> 0:10:6,9
Soy sauce is even sold out.

351
0:10:6,9 --> 0:10:9,9
They're also beginning to learn how to make tofu with green onions.

352
0:10:9,9 --> 0:10:9,929
Learning how to make braised pork is also a good idea.

353
0:10:9,929 --> 0:10:10,95
This is a good thing.

354
0:10:10,95 --> 0:10:12,15
So, when it comes to many things,

355
0:10:12,15 --> 0:10:15,579
you need to take the puzzle piece from others,

356
0:10:15,579 --> 0:10:17,319
only by bringing the flat head over,

357
0:10:17,319 --> 0:10:18,759
walk on two legs,

358
0:10:18,759 --> 0:10:20,519
read with both hands,

359
0:10:20,519 --> 0:10:21,339
can this issue be resolved.

360
0:10:21,339 --> 0:10:25,869
Don't always promote your stuff just for the sake of it.

361
0:10:25,869 --> 0:10:26,929
Conducting propaganda

362
0:10:26,929 --> 0:10:29,44
Engaging in public opinion warfare is pointless.

363
0:10:29,44 --> 0:10:31,76
You need to thoroughly understand what others have

364
0:10:31,76 --> 0:10:34,42
Or rather, what your enemies have

365
0:10:34,42 --> 0:10:36,26
Take our current attitude toward Japan

366
0:10:36,26 --> 0:10:37,75
What about the generation born in the 2000s

367
0:10:37,75 --> 0:10:39,95
Why are those born in the 1990s also interested in Japan?

368
0:10:39,95 --> 0:10:41,49
Because they have visited Japan multiple times

369
0:10:41,49 --> 0:10:42,91
And they have learned the Japanese language

370
0:10:42,91 --> 0:10:44,41
Life in Japan has changed

371
0:10:44,41 --> 0:10:46,45
So many people have developed an interest in Japan

372
0:10:46,45 --> 0:10:49,5
It's connected to the bubble economy of the 1970s and 80s

373
0:10:49,5 --> 0:10:50,37
People who went to work there during that time

374
0:10:50,37 --> 0:10:51,94
Can we think the same way?

375
0:10:51,94 --> 0:10:53,47
Of course, it's a different story

376
0:10:53,47 --> 0:10:55,79
Today's international students are different from those 20 years ago

377
0:10:55,79 --> 0:10:56,57
They are not the same

378
0:10:56,57 --> 0:10:58,55
Today's students are more confident

379
0:10:58,55 --> 0:11:0,21
It feels even better

380
0:11:0,21 --> 0:11:1,73
I started eating right away when I got back

381
0:11:1,73 --> 0:11:2,85
Back then, you see

382
0:11:2,85 --> 0:11:5,73
I didn’t really notice much difference in the food after I went out

383
0:11:5,73 --> 0:11:7,19
It was just cooking for myself over there

384
0:11:7,19 --> 0:11:7,849
Right?

385
0:11:7,849 --> 0:11:9,809
But it’s not like today’s production

386
0:11:9,809 --> 0:11:11,609
The material life is so abundant now

387
0:11:11,609 --> 0:11:14,4
Back then, I thought learning a few Western dishes was quite fun

388
0:11:14,4 --> 0:11:15,64
That was just how things were back then.

389
0:11:15,64 --> 0:11:18,2
The development gap in life was huge back then.

390
0:11:18,2 --> 0:11:19,88
So the disparities persist to this day.

391
0:11:19,88 --> 0:11:22,83
But the roles have reversed in many aspects.

392
0:11:22,83 --> 0:11:23,95
It's completely different now.

393
0:11:23,95 --> 0:11:27,55
So we can say that today we have a thoroughly new

394
0:11:27,55 --> 0:11:29,12
cultural confidence.

395
0:11:29,12 --> 0:11:30,48
cultural confidence.

396
0:11:30,48 --> 0:11:31,48
Don't be so

397
0:11:31,48 --> 0:11:32,44
Like a dagger to one's pride

398
0:11:32,44 --> 0:11:33,28
Don't be so uptight

399
0:11:33,28 --> 0:11:34,2
Progress step by step

400
0:11:34,2 --> 0:11:35,12
A very conservative state

401
0:11:35,12 --> 0:11:36,21
That's not the case

402
0:11:36,21 --> 0:11:37,23
Move forward

403
0:11:37,23 --> 0:11:38,39
Stride forward boldly

404
0:11:38,39 --> 0:11:40,21
Tackle problems as they arise

405
0:11:40,21 --> 0:11:42,22
Don't worry about potential issues

406
0:11:42,22 --> 0:11:44,26
If there's a problem, solve it, and everything will be fine.

407
0:11:44,26 --> 0:11:46,12
No day is the end of the world

408
0:11:46,12 --> 0:11:47,9
We need to have confidence.

409
0:11:47,9 --> 0:11:49,88
But not a blind confidence.

410
0:11:49,88 --> 0:11:51,68
It's like water without a source.

411
0:11:51,68 --> 0:11:53,88
A very important person.

412
0:11:53,88 --> 0:11:54,92
Development works the same way.

413
0:11:54,92 --> 0:11:56,4
No matter what opinion you express.

414
0:11:56,4 --> 0:11:56,96
I'll be fine.

415
0:11:56,96 --> 0:11:58,22
There will definitely be people who criticize you

416
0:11:58,22 --> 0:12:0,44
Just like I mentioned in my last video

417
0:12:0,44 --> 0:12:1,4
It's been 26 years

418
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:2,38
I finally understand myself

419
0:12:2,38 --> 0:12:5,1
No one will love me anymore, and so on

420
0:12:5,1 --> 0:12:6,74
Then many people read the title

421
0:12:6,74 --> 0:12:7,54
Read a couple of sentences

422
0:12:7,54 --> 0:12:8,34
Come in to criticize

423
0:12:8,34 --> 0:12:9,22
Say what they think

424
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:11,329
Or someone comes to wish me well

425
0:12:11,329 --> 0:12:13,249
I think that's pretty funny

426
0:12:13,249 --> 0:12:13,809
You know

427
0:12:13,809 --> 0:12:18,17
I'm just using this question to expand my thinking.

428
0:12:18,17 --> 0:12:20,63
What kind of things do I observe?

429
0:12:20,63 --> 0:12:22,69
I really need some love

430
0:12:23,21 --> 0:12:24,19
I really need some love

431
0:12:24,19 --> 0:12:25,15
Just do it

432
0:12:25,15 --> 0:12:25,67
Right?

433
0:12:25,67 --> 0:12:27,37
You don't have to worry about so many new things

434
0:12:27,37 --> 0:12:30,12
I'm not really lacking

435
0:12:30,12 --> 0:12:31,58
With you guys, I'm not lacking

436
0:12:31,58 --> 0:12:34,29
Those are the people I was talking about who left the comments.

437
0:12:34,29 --> 0:12:36,15
How could I be lacking?

438
0:12:36,15 --> 0:12:37,93
I've always been practicing in real situations

439
0:12:37,93 --> 0:12:38,73
How so?

440
0:12:38,73 --> 0:12:39,99
So how could I possibly be lacking?

441
0:12:39,99 --> 0:12:42,45
Exactly, it's like Sima Zhao's intentions, right?

442
0:12:42,45 --> 0:12:43,57
That's just how things are

443
0:12:43,57 --> 0:12:45,93
So don't judge by appearances

444
0:12:45,93 --> 0:12:48,1
That's not people's real thoughts

445
0:12:48,1 --> 0:12:48,81
That's the way it is

446
0:12:48,81 --> 0:12:50,1
Because I'm doing a show

447
0:12:50,1 --> 0:12:51,73
I definitely need to open up my mind

448
0:12:51,73 --> 0:12:53,87
I have to put myself in the character's shoes

449
0:12:53,87 --> 0:12:55,35
I need to become that character

450
0:12:55,35 --> 0:12:58,339
I need to embody the state of someone who doesn't get love

451
0:12:58,339 --> 0:13:0,199
So this is a kind of performance.

452
0:13:0,199 --> 0:13:2,359
It's a reenactment of a scenario.

453
0:13:2,359 --> 0:13:5,179
It's also a way to put ourselves in others' shoes and discuss these issues together.

454
0:13:5,179 --> 0:13:9,73
It's not that I actually have these problems myself.

455
0:13:9,73 --> 0:13:13,11
I might not be able to delve deeply into these issues either.

456
0:13:13,11 --> 0:13:14,57
So, up to today.

457
0:13:14,57 --> 0:13:17,27
Don't really think that others...

458
0:13:17,27 --> 0:13:18,77
Will definitely have some issue.

459
0:13:18,77 --> 0:13:19,81
Before they would discuss it with you.

460
0:13:19,81 --> 0:13:20,37
These things

461
0:13:20,37 --> 0:13:22,93
It's not really because there's a principle in communication studies.

462
0:13:22,93 --> 0:13:25,62
which is that you need to position yourself in a relatively humble place

463
0:13:25,62 --> 0:13:27,76
you have to be the clown in society

464
0:13:27,76 --> 0:13:31,24
the one who is seen as funny by everyone

465
0:13:31,24 --> 0:13:31,94
that person

466
0:13:31,94 --> 0:13:34,8
the one in an awkward situation

467
0:13:34,8 --> 0:13:35,84
This aligns with the principles of communication studies.

468
0:13:35,84 --> 0:13:39,17
you don't necessarily have to be a one-to-one replica in real life

469
0:13:39,17 --> 0:13:40,17
Exact replica

470
0:13:40,17 --> 0:13:40,97
That's how it is

471
0:13:40,97 --> 0:13:44,58
So we often say that we shouldn't create confrontation

472
0:13:44,58 --> 0:13:45,84
We should look for common ground

473
0:13:45,84 --> 0:13:47,72
Don't argue until you're red in the face

474
0:13:47,72 --> 0:13:48,88
Or until your neck is stiff

475
0:13:48,88 --> 0:13:50,569
We should seek resonance

476
0:13:50,569 --> 0:13:53,7
In the process, discover new opportunities

477
0:13:53,7 --> 0:13:56,22
And make new friends along the way

478
0:13:56,22 --> 0:13:58,6
I highly recommend everyone to visit Xiao Hong's Study Room

479
0:13:58,6 --> 0:14:0,14
Now, chat more with foreigners

480
0:14:0,14 --> 0:14:1,34
Check the accounts

481
0:14:1,34 --> 0:14:4,2
Talk about what we lack compared to others

482
0:14:4,2 --> 0:14:5,8
We can also check and compare

483
0:14:5,8 --> 0:14:8,589
But more often, it’s that others might suddenly find their wall has fallen

484
0:14:8,589 --> 0:14:10,149
An information gap appears

485
0:14:10,149 --> 0:14:10,849
They realize

486
0:14:10,849 --> 0:14:13,169
That the Chinese people are not actually living in such dire straits

487
0:14:13,169 --> 0:14:13,789
In dire straits

488
0:14:13,789 --> 0:14:15,72
It’s actually quite amusing

489
0:14:15,72 --> 0:14:18,4
But we have some things here too

490
0:14:18,4 --> 0:14:20,98
That can be learned from developed countries, which is quite different

491
0:14:20,98 --> 0:14:23,46
So our main focus should be on liberating our own minds

492
0:14:23,46 --> 0:14:24,96
Liberating our own minds

493
0:14:24,96 --> 0:14:28,87
Is not about saving someone or becoming one of them

494
0:14:28,87 --> 0:14:30,75
It’s not about standing alone

495
0:14:30,75 --> 0:14:33,6
These things are all about confidence

496
0:14:33,6 --> 0:14:36,84
But I suggest you don’t set up

497
0:14:36,84 --> 0:14:38,319
How should I put this

498
0:14:38,319 --> 0:14:40,719
A strong barrier, like Trump

499
0:14:40,719 --> 0:14:41,779
Building a border wall

500
0:14:41,779 --> 0:14:43,999
Opening up and allowing visa-free entry

501
0:14:43,999 --> 0:14:44,519
No problem

502
0:14:44,519 --> 0:14:45,81
Let everyone come and see

503
0:14:45,81 --> 0:14:47,45
Let them see our lives

504
0:14:47,45 --> 0:14:48,65
Let them see our thoughts

505
0:14:48,65 --> 0:14:49,37
There’s no issue

506
0:14:49,37 --> 0:14:50,59
Correcting wrongs should not go too far

507
0:14:50,59 --> 0:14:52,35
Being well-versed in both Eastern and Western knowledge

508
0:14:52,35 --> 0:14:54,51
Balancing humanities and sciences

509
0:14:54,51 --> 0:14:55,23
Integrating both civil and military aspects

510
0:14:55,23 --> 0:14:56,23
This is the best

511
0:14:56,23 --> 0:14:59,7
Because as you can see, in Bagua Tai Chi and all these things

512
0:14:59,7 --> 0:15:0,51
Yin and Yang are in harmonious balance

513
0:15:0,51 --> 0:15:2,27
There shouldn’t be so much conflict

514
0:15:2,27 --> 0:15:5,3
Always fighting like those in the Middle East

515
0:15:5,3 --> 0:15:5,87
That’s not interesting

516
0:15:5,87 --> 0:15:7,63
The best is not about heaven and hell

517
0:15:7,63 --> 0:15:8,99
Not about rewarding the good and punishing the evil

518
0:15:8,99 --> 0:15:10,77
It’s about the fusion of Yin and Yang

519
0:15:10,77 --> 0:15:11,95
The integration of good and evil

520
0:15:11,95 --> 0:15:13,41
This is the essence of human nature

521
0:15:13,41 --> 0:15:15,45
This is why sometimes I talk about some dark aspects

522
0:15:15,45 --> 0:15:17,27
And then blend them together

523
0:15:17,27 --> 0:15:18,8
Because this is a harmonious balance

524
0:15:18,8 --> 0:15:20,78
This is what makes it interesting

525
0:15:20,78 --> 0:15:22,46
So today, we’re saying don’t overcorrect

526
0:15:22,46 --> 0:15:25,28
Don’t use a mindset of struggle

527
0:15:25,28 --> 0:15:27,5
Struggle with everyone

528
0:15:27,5 --> 0:15:28,96
Struggle between left and right

529
0:15:28,96 --> 0:15:30,46
Struggle between good and evil

530
0:15:30,46 --> 0:15:31,6
The struggle between good and evil

531
0:15:31,6 --> 0:15:32,65
To others, they still see it as a step towards good

532
0:15:32,65 --> 0:15:34,67
Then what are you?

533
0:15:34,67 --> 0:15:35,73
So many things are like this

534
0:15:35,73 --> 0:15:37,19
Don’t always look for confrontation

535
0:15:37,19 --> 0:15:38,95
Find more points of agreement

536
0:15:38,95 --> 0:15:40,59
Tell the story of Sino-American friendship well

537
0:15:40,59 --> 0:15:43,3
Right?

538
0:15:43,3 --> 0:15:43,71
Welcome President Trump’s visit to China
