1
0:0:1,4 --> 0:0:3,2
Let me talk about it.

2
0:0:3,2 --> 0:0:4,0
Hehehe

3
0:0:4,0 --> 0:0:5,46
I'm not imitating Wang Weiheng.

4
0:0:5,46 --> 0:0:9,11
Let me talk about the Middle East issue.

5
0:0:9,11 --> 0:0:13,3
If you look through my older videos, you might notice the issue of the Middle East.

6
0:0:13,3 --> 0:0:15,7
When it comes to the Middle East issue for me...

7
0:0:15,7 --> 0:0:18,45
Is something I've only discussed once.

8
0:0:18,45 --> 0:0:20,7
An issue I've only discussed once.

9
0:0:20,7 --> 0:0:21,87
In that ancient video

10
0:0:21,87 --> 0:0:25,21
I once talked about a certain way of thinking back then

11
0:0:25,21 --> 0:0:27,71
which is not to offend small-minded people

12
0:0:27,71 --> 0:0:30,129
how to put it

13
0:0:30,129 --> 0:0:33,649
a country like Israel, how should I say

14
0:0:33,649 --> 0:0:36,95
is very much like a small-minded person in life

15
0:0:36,95 --> 0:0:37,93
if you offend them

16
0:0:37,93 --> 0:0:39,58
troubles will pile up

17
0:0:39,58 --> 0:0:41,8
if you confront them directly

18
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:42,74
they won’t confront you head-on

19
0:0:42,74 --> 0:0:43,98
That's the kind of situation.

20
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:48,26
So, how should we approach this kind of international relationship?

21
0:0:48,26 --> 0:0:50,14
Back then, I said not to provoke them.

22
0:0:50,14 --> 0:0:51,18
If you do provoke them,

23
0:0:51,18 --> 0:0:53,94
they will cause you trouble on significant issues.

24
0:0:53,94 --> 0:0:55,32
First, let's build up some armor.

25
0:0:55,32 --> 0:0:57,819
The Middle East issue is a very complex one.

26
0:0:57,819 --> 0:0:58,419
Um,

27
0:0:58,419 --> 0:1:1,59
Around the start of the first Middle East War

28
0:1:1,59 --> 0:1:2,939
It's been 77 years now.

29
0:1:2,939 --> 0:1:5,539
If everyone wants to delve into the Middle East issues,

30
0:1:5,539 --> 0:1:7,1
they are incredibly complex.

31
0:1:7,1 --> 0:1:8,8
Um,

32
0:1:8,8 --> 0:1:11,76
all these grudges and entanglements date back to before 77 years ago.

33
0:1:11,76 --> 0:1:14,8
It's also closely related to the support from the UK and the US.

34
0:1:14,8 --> 0:1:15,66
Regardless,

35
0:1:15,66 --> 0:1:19,36
the series of actions taken by Israel against the people of Gaza,

36
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:20,68
such behavior, to put it bluntly,

37
0:1:20,68 --> 0:1:22,94
This would be considered a war crime.

38
0:1:22,94 --> 0:1:25,22
It falls under the category of genocide.

39
0:1:25,22 --> 0:1:25,9
Regardless of the circumstances,

40
0:1:25,9 --> 0:1:27,5
This is simply unjustifiable.

41
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:29,3
When we look at it,

42
0:1:29,3 --> 0:1:30,79
It can actually backfire.

43
0:1:30,79 --> 0:1:32,11
At present,

44
0:1:32,11 --> 0:1:34,91
Israeli citizens' international travel,

45
0:1:34,91 --> 0:1:37,16
And they find that many places are

46
0:1:37,16 --> 0:1:38,8
I find them extremely repulsive

47
0:1:38,8 --> 0:1:39,8
So, when it comes to this matter

48
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:44,64
You've made your own international space smaller.

49
0:1:44,64 --> 0:1:47,16
But how can we put it when talking about this issue

50
0:1:47,16 --> 0:1:49,38
It's like the Munich massacre incident

51
0:1:49,38 --> 0:1:54,25
regarding that Hamas raid on their Music event

52
0:1:54,25 --> 0:1:55,88
Right?

53
0:1:55,88 --> 0:1:58,52
Israel's response was extremely strong

54
0:1:58,52 --> 0:2:2,12
but they feel why the international community doesn't support them

55
0:2:2,12 --> 0:2:4,8
Why does the international community show so much sympathy for these people?

56
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:6,16
So, to explain,

57
0:2:6,16 --> 0:2:8,96
the international public opinion is overwhelmingly one-sided.

58
0:2:8,96 --> 0:2:10,1
Generally speaking,

59
0:2:10,1 --> 0:2:12,8
at the beginning, there were still some people who sympathized with Israel,

60
0:2:12,8 --> 0:2:14,63
but as time went on,

61
0:2:14,63 --> 0:2:16,63
as the Gaza situation progressed,

62
0:2:16,63 --> 0:2:19,43
now there’s actually a state where everyone is calling for action against them.

63
0:2:19,43 --> 0:2:21,43
So, everyone feels that their actions have been extremely excessive.

64
0:2:21,43 --> 0:2:23,12
would all condemn it

65
0:2:23,6 --> 0:2:26,36
but today, from what perspective should we consider

66
0:2:26,36 --> 0:2:27,12
this issue

67
0:2:27,12 --> 0:2:28,76
speaking of which

68
0:2:28,76 --> 0:2:29,36
Israel

69
0:2:29,36 --> 0:2:33,33
could still potentially be the dominant power in the Middle East

70
0:2:33,33 --> 0:2:36,17
based on the analysis of international trends

71
0:2:36,17 --> 0:2:37,99
the U.S. military has

72
0:2:37,99 --> 0:2:40,99
deployed a significant number of aerial refueling tankers

73
0:2:40,99 --> 0:2:44,13
Flying over from the other side of the Atlantic

74
0:2:44,13 --> 0:2:45,41
it's likely they are supporting Israel

75
0:2:45,41 --> 0:2:48,65
because he now has control over the airspace above Tehran

76
0:2:48,65 --> 0:2:49,69
securing air superiority

77
0:2:49,69 --> 0:2:50,35
which means

78
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:53,85
if we look at this from an international political perspective

79
0:2:53,85 --> 0:2:56,67
without any emotional bias, in a cold and objective manner

80
0:2:56,67 --> 0:2:58,23
coldly analyzing this situation

81
0:2:58,23 --> 0:3:0,95
you'll find that the suffering of the people in Gaza is profound

82
0:3:0,95 --> 0:3:4,55
This thing validates a very long-standing rule

83
0:3:4,55 --> 0:3:5,55
the law of the jungle

84
0:3:5,55 --> 0:3:6,85
in this world

85
0:3:6,85 --> 0:3:8,7
it's survival of the fittest

86
0:3:8,7 --> 0:3:9,3
it's very harsh

87
0:3:9,3 --> 0:3:11,99
there isn't really any country with the power

88
0:3:11,99 --> 0:3:14,64
or the capability to mediate the situation

89
0:3:14,64 --> 0:3:17,56
because there is no country around which

90
0:3:17,56 --> 0:3:18,92
basically has no formidable rivals

91
0:3:18,92 --> 0:3:20,2
People say that the State of Israel is so small

92
0:3:20,2 --> 0:3:21,74
why doesn't it have formidable enemies?

93
0:3:21,74 --> 0:3:24,46
That's because you have to look at the major players in the Middle East

94
0:3:24,46 --> 0:3:25,66
like Saudi Arabia and Iran

95
0:3:25,66 --> 0:3:30,37
and Egypt, not to mention Tunisia

96
0:3:30,37 --> 0:3:33,9
Turkey should be the strongest power

97
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:37,82
Turkey, a secular country

98
0:3:37,82 --> 0:3:40,38
although it's somewhat returning to the old path of religious influence

99
0:3:40,38 --> 0:3:42,899
it remains a very powerful nation

100
0:3:42,899 --> 0:3:44,379
And the Ottoman Empire

101
0:3:44,379 --> 0:3:48,88
once extended its reach to the west

102
0:3:48,88 --> 0:3:50,72
all the way to the Danube River

103
0:3:50,72 --> 0:3:53,52
and in the east, it controlled Palestine

104
0:3:53,52 --> 0:3:55,43
and Egypt, which was quite formidable

105
0:3:55,43 --> 0:3:58,27
It could be said that compared to the Eastern Roman Empire of old,

106
0:3:58,27 --> 0:3:59,51
though it controlled slightly less territory

107
0:3:59,51 --> 0:4:2,5
but its control over the Middle East was very strong

108
0:4:2,5 --> 0:4:3,86
due to religious factors

109
0:4:3,86 --> 0:4:5,61
He belongs to the same religion

110
0:4:5,61 --> 0:4:8,9
However, in other areas

111
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:11,64
If you've read the history of the Middle East wars

112
0:4:11,64 --> 0:4:13,82
You'll find this is the Middle East War for the nth time.

113
0:4:13,82 --> 0:4:15,56
From the first to the fourth

114
0:4:15,56 --> 0:4:17,56
In terms of Egypt's military capability

115
0:4:17,56 --> 0:4:19,52
It has generally been weaker

116
0:4:19,52 --> 0:4:21,28
There were times when it was strong

117
0:4:21,28 --> 0:4:24,19
But when you consider these Arab countries together

118
0:4:24,19 --> 0:4:26,219
When we talk about Arab countries as a whole,

119
0:4:26,219 --> 0:4:28,219
due to the strategy we have adopted,

120
0:4:28,219 --> 0:4:32,22
our diplomatic approach has been to facilitate the reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

121
0:4:32,22 --> 0:4:34,9
As a responsible major country,

122
0:4:34,9 --> 0:4:36,86
in many issues,

123
0:4:36,86 --> 0:4:39,3
we have maintained a neutral stance.

124
0:4:39,3 --> 0:4:42,35
However, regarding the excessive actions taken by Israel recently,

125
0:4:42,35 --> 0:4:43,78
we have taken measures to stop them.

126
0:4:43,78 --> 0:4:47,3
I have always believed that neutrality can be detrimental to oneself.

127
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:49,76
Such a choice is beneficial for world peace

128
0:4:49,76 --> 0:4:53,3
For instance, our neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine conflict

129
0:4:53,43 --> 0:4:55,51
Actually, taking sides

130
0:4:55,51 --> 0:4:58,49
Can be advantageous for one's diplomatic gains

131
0:4:58,49 --> 0:4:59,75
Lian Yun once said

132
0:4:59,75 --> 0:5:1,27
If you support the winning side

133
0:5:1,27 --> 0:5:2,39
The winning side will thank you

134
0:5:2,39 --> 0:5:3,43
If you support the losing side

135
0:5:3,43 --> 0:5:4,89
The losing side will also thank you

136
0:5:4,89 --> 0:5:6,56
Only you remain neutral

137
0:5:6,56 --> 0:5:8,46
The winning side feels you didn’t help them

138
0:5:8,46 --> 0:5:9,76
They will resent you for it

139
0:5:9,76 --> 0:5:11,44
The losing side thinks you didn’t sympathize with them

140
0:5:11,44 --> 0:5:13,28
Not showing pity will also make them blame you

141
0:5:13,28 --> 0:5:14,44
So, to maintain neutrality

142
0:5:14,44 --> 0:5:17,8
You must have sufficient strength and be powerful

143
0:5:17,8 --> 0:5:19,21
This ability to stay out of the conflict

144
0:5:19,21 --> 0:5:23,9
Especially when many countries are in conflict now

145
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:24,29
Let's all look at our expressions first

146
0:5:24,29 --> 0:5:26,9
It's kind of like the Minister of Civil Affairs in Japan.

147
0:5:26,9 --> 0:5:29,2
As the top daimyo of the Warring States period

148
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:31,82
Many people will surely understand your thoughts and stance

149
0:5:31,82 --> 0:5:33,9
Whoever you support will win

150
0:5:34,14 --> 0:5:35,62
When it comes to the issue of Israel

151
0:5:35,62 --> 0:5:37,54
We need to approach this with a calm mindset

152
0:5:37,54 --> 0:5:38,6
That's right

153
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:39,46
Given his current position

154
0:5:39,46 --> 0:5:43,2
It can be said that there's no match for it in the Middle East.

155
0:5:43,2 --> 0:5:44,52
Saudi Arabia

156
0:5:44,52 --> 0:5:46,37
and Iran

157
0:5:46,37 --> 0:5:48,77
and Turkey

158
0:5:48,77 --> 0:5:50,299
and Egypt are different

159
0:5:50,299 --> 0:5:51,459
because, to put it simply

160
0:5:51,459 --> 0:5:52,919
there are only three types of regimes in the Middle East

161
0:5:52,919 --> 0:5:54,579
one is a theocratic regime

162
0:5:54,579 --> 0:5:57,21
like Iran, for example

163
0:5:57,21 --> 0:5:58,81
If you've seen that film

164
0:5:58,81 --> 0:5:59,77
I grew up in Iran

165
0:5:59,77 --> 0:6:1,39
you'd know how the people of Iran feel

166
0:6:1,39 --> 0:6:3,53
about their current leader, Khamenei

167
0:6:3,53 --> 0:6:5,57
and what they think of this government

168
0:6:5,57 --> 0:6:9,28
The domestic situation is also very complex, with various forces intertwined

169
0:6:9,28 --> 0:6:11,44
From the perspective of ordinary Iranians

170
0:6:11,44 --> 0:6:12,52
When I was in France

171
0:6:12,52 --> 0:6:15,58
I met quite a few Iranian exiles

172
0:6:15,58 --> 0:6:17,88
There are a great many people in the art industry.

173
0:6:17,88 --> 0:6:19,6
They are incredibly talented.

174
0:6:19,6 --> 0:6:22,58
And when you look at my time in Canada,

175
0:6:22,58 --> 0:6:24,8
I was taking international relations classes.

176
0:6:24,8 --> 0:6:27,18
At that time, the international relations class was taught by an elderly lady.

177
0:6:27,18 --> 0:6:28,66
She was also a think tank member from Israel.

178
0:6:28,66 --> 0:6:29,78
Although she was Canadian,

179
0:6:29,78 --> 0:6:30,7
she was of Jewish descent.

180
0:6:30,7 --> 0:6:31,8
A think tank member from Israel.

181
0:6:31,8 --> 0:6:34,8
Back then, we had classmates

182
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:35,8
including Libyans

183
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:36,33
and Tunisians

184
0:6:36,33 --> 0:6:38,13
who pointed at this elderly lady and said

185
0:6:38,13 --> 0:6:38,69
A woman

186
0:6:38,69 --> 0:6:40,89
how could a Jewish woman teach us?

187
0:6:40,89 --> 0:6:42,37
and then they left the classroom

188
0:6:42,37 --> 0:6:44,85
it was during the time of the conflict in Syria

189
0:6:44,85 --> 0:6:45,69
the civil war

190
0:6:45,69 --> 0:6:47,31
There are quite a few films by Mughal.

191
0:6:47,31 --> 0:6:50,3
So, this experience of studying abroad

192
0:6:50,3 --> 0:6:51,78
has given me a variety of

193
0:6:51,78 --> 0:6:54,26
opportunities to interact with people from different backgrounds.

194
0:6:54,26 --> 0:6:55,58
For example, Iraqis,

195
0:6:55,58 --> 0:6:56,5
Syrians,

196
0:6:56,5 --> 0:6:58,2
and Libyans.

197
0:6:58,2 --> 0:7:0,48
Their thoughts and perspectives vary greatly.

198
0:7:0,48 --> 0:7:4,0
So you'll find that, when it comes to the Middle East,

199
0:7:4,0 --> 0:7:5,88
Let's include all these major countries.

200
0:7:5,88 --> 0:7:9,28
Like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Egypt.

201
0:7:9,28 --> 0:7:11,82
Egypt was previously under military rule.

202
0:7:11,82 --> 0:7:13,5
Speaking of Saudi Arabia,

203
0:7:13,5 --> 0:7:15,3
We're talking about a federation of emirates.

204
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:16,4
It's a kind of

205
0:7:16,4 --> 0:7:16,8
How to put it,

206
0:7:16,8 --> 0:7:19,159
It can be described as a feudal monarchy.

207
0:7:19,159 --> 0:7:20,919
For example, Jordan is similar.

208
0:7:20,919 --> 0:7:21,639
The UAE

209
0:7:21,639 --> 0:7:22,119
UAE

210
0:7:22,119 --> 0:7:23,12
These things are

211
0:7:23,12 --> 0:7:26,64
But there is no military power in the Middle East

212
0:7:26,64 --> 0:7:28,88
A country with very strong industrial capabilities

213
0:7:28,88 --> 0:7:30,97
That can rival Israel

214
0:7:30,97 --> 0:7:31,93
So speaking of it

215
0:7:31,93 --> 0:7:33,45
You see, Saudi Arabia is far from it

216
0:7:33,45 --> 0:7:35,87
Israel’s Netanyahu

217
0:7:35,87 --> 0:7:36,93
He sent a map

218
0:7:36,93 --> 0:7:40,68
basically showing what kind of territory a greater Israel might want in the future

219
0:7:40,68 --> 0:7:41,12
how extensive it would be

220
0:7:41,12 --> 0:7:43,52
including parts of Saudi Arabia and Egypt

221
0:7:43,52 --> 0:7:47,45
So, in terms of military strength and the level of infiltration

222
0:7:47,45 --> 0:7:49,99
these three countries are relatively weak

223
0:7:49,99 --> 0:7:51,41
Turkey is the only one that’s stronger

224
0:7:51,41 --> 0:7:54,7
but Turkey has its own, how should I put it,

225
0:7:54,7 --> 0:7:55,63
its own interests

226
0:7:55,63 --> 0:7:58,32
It has its own interests with the Turks

227
0:7:58,32 --> 0:7:59,6
Arabs are Arabs

228
0:7:59,6 --> 0:8:0,82
Iranians are Iranians

229
0:8:0,82 --> 0:8:1,88
These are different, you see

230
0:8:1,88 --> 0:8:3,4
Persians are Persians

231
0:8:3,4 --> 0:8:5,56
However, Arab countries can't

232
0:8:5,56 --> 0:8:7,86
fully unite together

233
0:8:7,86 --> 0:8:9,4
it's impossible to unite

234
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:13,7
because it's a matter of systems and local customs

235
0:8:13,7 --> 0:8:14,75
What kind of nation are you establishing?

236
0:8:14,75 --> 0:8:18,219
Are you a federation or a vast empire?

237
0:8:18,219 --> 0:8:18,899
How is it structured?

238
0:8:18,899 --> 0:8:20,22
Who has such military power?

239
0:8:20,22 --> 0:8:21,7
To be able to conquer each other?

240
0:8:21,7 --> 0:8:24,74
To be honest, the reason the Middle East is the way it is today

241
0:8:24,74 --> 0:8:25,38
You'll find

242
0:8:25,38 --> 0:8:29,67
It's due to the division of spheres of influence by European powers back then.

243
0:8:29,67 --> 0:8:30,77
For instance, take Egypt

244
0:8:30,77 --> 0:8:32,7
There are also British and French influences

245
0:8:32,7 --> 0:8:33,85
Lebanon has French influence

246
0:8:33,85 --> 0:8:35,94
Saudi Arabia has British and American influence

247
0:8:35,94 --> 0:8:37,18
Speaking of Iran

248
0:8:37,18 --> 0:8:40,12
it has various influences from different countries, including the Soviet Union

249
0:8:40,12 --> 0:8:42,53
each controlling its own territory

250
0:8:42,53 --> 0:8:48,439
So, the Middle East has seen thousands of years of tribal conflicts

251
0:8:48,439 --> 0:8:49,239
ethnic conflicts

252
0:8:49,239 --> 0:8:52,199
and religious conflicts that are hard to reconcile

253
0:8:52,199 --> 0:8:53,84
It's really difficult to do that

254
0:8:53,84 --> 0:8:55,6
So, when we talk about it

255
0:8:55,6 --> 0:8:56,88
In the future, if it happens

256
0:8:56,88 --> 0:8:58,8
They could be picked off one by one by Israel

257
0:8:58,8 --> 0:9:1,3
This is a very likely scenario

258
0:9:1,3 --> 0:9:3,67
So you see, this time Israel has this issue

259
0:9:3,67 --> 0:9:4,91
When this crisis emerges

260
0:9:4,91 --> 0:9:6,43
They seek help from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council

261
0:9:6,43 --> 0:9:7,75
But notably, not from China

262
0:9:7,75 --> 0:9:10,7
Because China is a responsible major country

263
0:9:10,7 --> 0:9:12,75
a prominent figure with a strong humanist ideology

264
0:9:12,75 --> 0:9:15,13
Look at what we're talking about today

265
0:9:15,13 --> 0:9:16,53
In many issues

266
0:9:16,53 --> 0:9:19,21
People tend to curse them

267
0:9:19,21 --> 0:9:20,29
You finally got what you deserved

268
0:9:20,29 --> 0:9:20,81
How are you doing

269
0:9:20,81 --> 0:9:22,5
You must be feeling terrible and all

270
0:9:22,5 --> 0:9:24,13
Now you finally understand the dire consequences of war

271
0:9:24,13 --> 0:9:27,5
I think this is reflected in the sense of justice of our ordinary people.

272
0:9:27,5 --> 0:9:28,37
They are very principled.

273
0:9:28,37 --> 0:9:29,79
They are willing to stand on the side of the underdog.

274
0:9:29,79 --> 0:9:32,48
In the context of international politics,

275
0:9:32,48 --> 0:9:33,76
this is something that is hard to come by.

276
0:9:33,76 --> 0:9:36,43
It’s a remarkable act.

277
0:9:36,79 --> 0:9:39,71
However, when it comes to diplomacy and politics,

278
0:9:39,71 --> 0:9:41,91
especially from an intelligence perspective,

279
0:9:41,91 --> 0:9:45,13
often, one must be more cold-blooded in their speech.

280
0:9:45,13 --> 0:9:46,85
We need to stay calm.

281
0:9:46,85 --> 0:9:47,61
As everyone knows,

282
0:9:47,61 --> 0:9:51,11
the reason Israel was able to conduct

283
0:9:51,11 --> 0:9:53,43
such a successful targeted strike on Iran

284
0:9:53,43 --> 0:9:56,16
also related to Mossad's intelligence gathering capabilities

285
0:9:56,16 --> 0:9:59,4
its ability to recruit and infiltrate.

286
0:9:59,4 --> 0:10:0,92
Mossad is renowned for its strength

287
0:10:0,92 --> 0:10:2,55
and its reputation

288
0:10:2,55 --> 0:10:5,53
are closely tied to its early activities.

289
0:10:5,53 --> 0:10:8,47
I would say the most powerful intelligence organization in the world

290
0:10:8,47 --> 0:10:11,38
This intelligence organization should be Mossad.

291
0:10:11,38 --> 0:10:12,3
Secondly,

292
0:10:12,3 --> 0:10:15,3
it should be Russia.

293
0:10:15,3 --> 0:10:16,31
Thirdly, it’s the United Kingdom.

294
0:10:16,31 --> 0:10:19,789
Fourth comes the CIA and the like.

295
0:10:19,789 --> 0:10:21,589
But many people say it’s just like that.

296
0:10:21,589 --> 0:10:23,309
You have no idea how powerful our country is.

297
0:10:23,309 --> 0:10:24,309
It’s like this.

298
0:10:24,309 --> 0:10:25,509
The motherland is this powerful.

299
0:10:25,509 --> 0:10:27,3
It's not on the list, though.

300
0:10:27,3 --> 0:10:28,91
But you need to know about this Mossad

301
0:10:28,91 --> 0:10:30,67
has an extremely strong capability.

302
0:10:30,67 --> 0:10:32,3
Once you become an enemy of Mossad

303
0:10:32,3 --> 0:10:34,4
I mean, you can have a less friendly relationship with Israel,

304
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:37,74
But the relationship with Mossad must be maintained.

305
0:10:37,74 --> 0:10:39,4
at the very least, keep in touch.

306
0:10:39,4 --> 0:10:40,2
That's for sure.

307
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:42,89
Because his ability is exceptionally strong

308
0:10:42,89 --> 0:10:44,169
To go back to the earliest times

309
0:10:44,169 --> 0:10:45,449
The Israelis I know

310
0:10:45,449 --> 0:10:45,969
You see

311
0:10:45,969 --> 0:10:47,95
Starting from 2001

312
0:10:47,95 --> 0:10:50,45
I've known Israeli students coming to China

313
0:10:50,45 --> 0:10:51,99
These people, from a young age

314
0:10:51,99 --> 0:10:56,82
I feel they have a very calm and clear mind

315
0:10:56,82 --> 0:11:0,22
So you never really know what their true intentions are

316
0:11:0,22 --> 0:11:2,359
So, a lot of times, you see, it's just like this.

317
0:11:2,359 --> 0:11:5,119
Back then, there was a director from MI6, right?

318
0:11:5,119 --> 0:11:7,719
Now, the director used to be a foreign teacher here.

319
0:11:7,719 --> 0:11:8,719
So, in many ways,

320
0:11:8,719 --> 0:11:12,55
the mutual exchange of personnel is quite common.

321
0:11:12,55 --> 0:11:13,15
Quite common.

322
0:11:13,15 --> 0:11:15,65
When it comes to low-intensity intelligence gathering,

323
0:11:15,65 --> 0:11:16,52
it's very normal.

324
0:11:16,52 --> 0:11:18,56
But you could tell back then that these people were involved.

325
0:11:18,56 --> 0:11:21,44
He was closely associated with the early Chinese internet, particularly MSN.

326
0:11:21,44 --> 0:11:22,84
There are elements that have seeped in.

327
0:11:22,84 --> 0:11:24,4
They have had an impact.

328
0:11:24,4 --> 0:11:25,64
We can't afford to be complacent.

329
0:11:25,64 --> 0:11:26,84
For many of these issues,

330
0:11:26,84 --> 0:11:30,4
before they act out or commit significant events,

331
0:11:30,4 --> 0:11:32,37
you don't have enough evidence to prove it,

332
0:11:32,37 --> 0:11:33,83
or sufficient grounds to arrest them.

333
0:11:33,83 --> 0:11:34,79
That's how it is.

334
0:11:34,79 --> 0:11:35,67
So, to talk about it

335
0:11:35,67 --> 0:11:36,67
In the long term

336
0:11:36,67 --> 0:11:40,2
Mossad's infiltration into various countries around the world has been highly successful.

337
0:11:40,2 --> 0:11:41,18
Another point to consider

338
0:11:41,18 --> 0:11:43,4
We need to understand that the Russians

339
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:44,18
When it comes to the British

340
0:11:44,18 --> 0:11:45,3
They are all Caucasians

341
0:11:45,3 --> 0:11:49,7
It's relatively easier for Caucasians to infiltrate each other

342
0:11:49,7 --> 0:11:51,77
For example, if you send a few people to the United States

343
0:11:51,77 --> 0:11:53,17
Send a few people to Canada.

344
0:11:53,17 --> 0:11:54,37
Often blend into the crowd.

345
0:11:54,37 --> 0:11:55,66
You can’t tell.

346
0:11:55,66 --> 0:11:57,3
But it’s different in Asian countries.

347
0:11:57,3 --> 0:11:57,86
You’re Chinese.

348
0:11:57,86 --> 0:11:58,22
Japanese.

349
0:11:58,22 --> 0:11:58,62
Korean.

350
0:11:58,62 --> 0:11:59,42
Go there and talk about it.

351
0:11:59,42 --> 0:12:0,34
You really stand out.

352
0:12:0,34 --> 0:12:1,26
Often times,

353
0:12:1,26 --> 0:12:3,22
if you're in an Arab country and suddenly see a Chinese person,

354
0:12:3,22 --> 0:12:4,7
or if you're in Russia and suddenly see a Chinese person,

355
0:12:4,7 --> 0:12:6,47
Or you suddenly see a Chinese person in America

356
0:12:6,47 --> 0:12:9,75
without exception, they stand out easily.

357
0:12:9,75 --> 0:12:11,3
In this regard,

358
0:12:11,3 --> 0:12:13,18
so when it comes to natural intelligence-gathering capabilities,

359
0:12:13,18 --> 0:12:15,9
We are comparing ourselves to Mossad, to Russia, and to the UK.

360
0:12:15,9 --> 0:12:17,859
and we are also not as good as the United States.

361
0:12:17,859 --> 0:12:20,319
This is a disadvantage of human nature.

362
0:12:20,319 --> 0:12:22,99
Of course, it doesn't really matter.

363
0:12:22,99 --> 0:12:24,139
Because in many situations, we often maintain a neutral position.

364
0:12:24,139 --> 0:12:25,6
Which can actually be more convenient.

365
0:12:25,6 --> 0:12:26,88
This thing varies from person to person.

366
0:12:26,88 --> 0:12:28,78
But regardless of that,

367
0:12:28,78 --> 0:12:30,28
From my perspective,

368
0:12:30,28 --> 0:12:33,64
From my perspective

369
0:12:37,4 --> 0:12:38,12
has industrial capabilities

370
0:12:38,12 --> 0:12:40,74
if a country with some organizational capabilities is taken down

371
0:12:40,74 --> 0:12:43,13
it would have no rivals in the Middle East

372
0:12:43,13 --> 0:12:44,61
which is truly alarming

373
0:12:44,61 --> 0:12:45,95
if there are no rivals in the Middle East

374
0:12:45,95 --> 0:12:47,97
and it is the only one with nuclear weapons

375
0:12:47,97 --> 0:12:48,85
of course

376
0:12:48,85 --> 0:12:50,17
Saudi Arabia has them too

377
0:12:50,17 --> 0:12:51,41
speaking of this country

378
0:12:51,41 --> 0:12:52,77
This is rather subtle.

379
0:12:52,77 --> 0:12:54,61
So our attitude going forward

380
0:12:54,61 --> 0:12:56,17
will determine the future of the Middle East.

381
0:12:56,17 --> 0:12:57,65
Actually, this is quite interesting.

382
0:12:57,65 --> 0:12:58,97
Speaking from a public perspective,

383
0:12:58,97 --> 0:13:1,21
people condemn the attacks on Gaza.

384
0:13:1,21 --> 0:13:2,9
This is correct.

385
0:13:2,9 --> 0:13:5,34
However, from a diplomatic standpoint,

386
0:13:5,34 --> 0:13:8,2
how close should we maintain our relationship with Israel?

387
0:13:8,2 --> 0:13:9,53
This is a rather delicate matter.

388
0:13:9,53 --> 0:13:11,19
If you maintain too much distance,

389
0:13:11,19 --> 0:13:14,85
it could turn into a bridgehead for other major powers to attack us.

390
0:13:14,85 --> 0:13:16,499
or exclusively for our use,

391
0:13:16,499 --> 0:13:17,859
whether it’s economically,

392
0:13:17,859 --> 0:13:18,339
politically,

393
0:13:18,339 --> 0:13:18,819
militarily,

394
0:13:18,819 --> 0:13:19,659
diplomatically speaking,

395
0:13:19,659 --> 0:13:21,319
especially in terms of intelligence.

396
0:13:21,319 --> 0:13:24,819
He would be a negative factor for us.

397
0:13:24,819 --> 0:13:28,199
However, if you maintain a certain level of contact with him,

398
0:13:28,199 --> 0:13:30,51
Actually, Jews are good at business.

399
0:13:30,51 --> 0:13:31,47
For them,

400
0:13:31,47 --> 0:13:34,599
Many times, for money, they don't have as many principles.

401
0:13:34,599 --> 0:13:36,159
So in many cases,

402
0:13:36,159 --> 0:13:38,639
If you are in the current international situation,

403
0:13:38,639 --> 0:13:42,24
When the criticism against him is quite intense,

404
0:13:42,24 --> 0:13:45,14
Or when his people are suffering more

405
0:13:47,8 --> 0:13:51,44
And he is currently facing an existential crisis militarily.

406
0:13:51,44 --> 0:13:55,98
If there is a certain level of continued contact and engagement with him,

407
0:13:55,98 --> 0:13:58,95
or expressing concern about his survival status,

408
0:13:58,95 --> 0:14:0,19
or something along those lines,

409
0:14:0,19 --> 0:14:2,3
having such an attitude,

410
0:14:2,3 --> 0:14:5,83
it's like the unpopular student in your class,

411
0:14:5,83 --> 0:14:7,43
who is very capable,

412
0:14:7,43 --> 0:14:8,63
comes from a wealthy family,

413
0:14:8,63 --> 0:14:10,94
and doesn't get along well with classmates.

414
0:14:10,94 --> 0:14:13,7
When he was being criticized by the whole class,

415
0:14:13,7 --> 0:14:17,1
as someone who aspires to be the class president,

416
0:14:17,1 --> 0:14:20,1
you need to consider how to play this card,

417
0:14:20,1 --> 0:14:23,85
try to use this moment to your advantage,

418
0:14:23,85 --> 0:14:26,21
bringing him into your fold is actually the simplest solution,

419
0:14:26,21 --> 0:14:28,49
considering his reputation on the international stage,

420
0:14:28,49 --> 0:14:30,53
along with his military strategy,

421
0:14:30,53 --> 0:14:32,97
and his overall approach to geopolitics,

422
0:14:32,97 --> 0:14:34,13
in the context of the ongoing crisis.

423
0:14:34,13 --> 0:14:35,79
You could say it was the lowest point.

424
0:14:35,79 --> 0:14:37,91
Once he won, though,

425
0:14:37,91 --> 0:14:40,3
he successfully defeated Iran completely.

426
0:14:40,3 --> 0:14:43,16
After suppressing Saudi Arabia and Egypt,

427
0:14:43,16 --> 0:14:45,22
After completing the operations in the Gaza Strip and Jordan

428
0:14:45,22 --> 0:14:47,55
as well as the West Bank and other regions,

429
0:14:47,55 --> 0:14:49,37
considering his own position,

430
0:14:49,37 --> 0:14:50,12
Lebanon,

431
0:14:50,12 --> 0:14:50,84
Syria

432
0:14:50,84 --> 0:14:52,64
Countries like Jordan can't really pose a threat to him.

433
0:14:52,64 --> 0:14:54,66
After all, Jordan wouldn't be hostile towards him.

434
0:14:54,66 --> 0:14:57,829
And Egypt wouldn't be hostile either.

435
0:14:57,829 --> 0:15:1,189
You should know that Egypt is heavily influenced by Israel.

436
0:15:1,189 --> 0:15:3,109
I believe Saudi Arabia is also significantly influenced.

437
0:15:3,109 --> 0:15:8,19
Otherwise, he wouldn't place Egypt and Saudi Arabia together on the map.

438
0:15:8,19 --> 0:15:9,75
When it comes to Syria,

439
0:15:9,75 --> 0:15:11,55
there's virtually no control,

440
0:15:11,55 --> 0:15:12,63
no capability to strike him.

441
0:15:12,63 --> 0:15:16,15
So, in a situation where he has naval and air superiority,

442
0:15:16,15 --> 0:15:17,77
What exactly does that mean?

443
0:15:17,77 --> 0:15:20,15
His only distinctive feature is,

444
0:15:20,15 --> 0:15:22,77
Why does he want to gather all the Israelis back?

445
0:15:22,77 --> 0:15:25,12
When it comes to ground warfare,

446
0:15:25,12 --> 0:15:26,76
He might not have such a large pool of troops,

447
0:15:26,76 --> 0:15:28,6
Unable to control such a vast occupied territory,

448
0:15:28,6 --> 0:15:31,15
So if he really wants to build up his forces,

449
0:15:31,15 --> 0:15:33,37
To control a large swath of territory in the Middle East.

450
0:15:33,37 --> 0:15:36,7
He still faces significant obstacles

451
0:15:36,7 --> 0:15:38,28
So at this point

452
0:15:38,6 --> 0:15:41,16
Everyone needs to see that the Middle East situation remains unchanged

453
0:15:41,16 --> 0:15:43,39
That's most beneficial for us

454
0:15:43,39 --> 0:15:46,41
If the Middle East situation changes rapidly

455
0:15:46,41 --> 0:15:48,43
If it turns in his favor

456
0:15:48,43 --> 0:15:49,35
Why would he do this

457
0:15:49,35 --> 0:15:52,329
Because the United States' influence is also declining

458
0:15:52,329 --> 0:15:55,749
He will certainly take advantage of the weakened influence in the American market.

459
0:15:55,749 --> 0:15:57,8
Before the military influence completely waned

460
0:15:57,8 --> 0:15:59,52
not many people took it seriously, did they?

461
0:15:59,52 --> 0:16:2,95
Because he has a military alliance treaty with the United States

462
0:16:2,95 --> 0:16:5,47
This treaty is different from the ones with Japan and South Korea

463
0:16:5,47 --> 0:16:7,5
As Japan and South Korea have U.S. troops stationed there

464
0:16:7,5 --> 0:16:9,84
Israel, on the other hand, is in a military alliance

465
0:16:9,84 --> 0:16:10,6
So, under this military alliance

466
0:16:10,6 --> 0:16:12,32
the U.S. has to provide refueling aircraft

467
0:16:12,32 --> 0:16:13,44
and bombers, among other things

468
0:16:13,44 --> 0:16:15,32
Everyone knows that the First Middle East War was fought like this.

469
0:16:15,32 --> 0:16:16,66
It was tacitly approved by the United States.

470
0:16:16,66 --> 0:16:19,82
So, in a sense, it's a little bully that the U.S. has propped up in the Middle East.

471
0:16:19,82 --> 0:16:20,54
Without Israel,

472
0:16:20,54 --> 0:16:22,56
there would be other U.S. client states.

473
0:16:22,56 --> 0:16:23,86
This is a very normal thing.

474
0:16:23,86 --> 0:16:26,44
It's just that this is a very useful tool.

475
0:16:26,44 --> 0:16:28,56
But a country's population growth,

476
0:16:28,56 --> 0:16:29,7
its military manpower,

477
0:16:29,7 --> 0:16:31,56
Given his control capabilities

478
0:16:31,56 --> 0:16:33,319
he wouldn't have grown so rapidly

479
0:16:33,319 --> 0:16:35,679
But in the state of affairs over the next few decades

480
0:16:35,679 --> 0:16:37,879
if we continue to be in an adversarial relationship with him

481
0:16:37,879 --> 0:16:41,159
from the government to the public, being in an adversarial state

482
0:16:41,159 --> 0:16:42,8
it would be detrimental to us

483
0:16:42,8 --> 0:16:46,16
but if we maintain a moderate level of engagement

484
0:16:46,16 --> 0:16:47,84
in many cases

485
0:16:47,84 --> 0:16:52,65
we can obtain intelligence through the Israeli network about the British

486
0:16:52,65 --> 0:16:53,65
What about the Russians?

487
0:16:53,65 --> 0:16:55,21
What are the Americans up to?

488
0:16:55,21 --> 0:16:57,22
Actually, this is quite convenient.

489
0:16:57,22 --> 0:16:58,82
If there is some communication,

490
0:16:58,82 --> 0:17:0,54
Because throughout history,

491
0:17:0,54 --> 0:17:2,26
There have been various examples.

492
0:17:2,26 --> 0:17:4,98
When we engage with the two major powers, the US and the USSR,

493
0:17:4,98 --> 0:17:6,46
In this balance of power game,

494
0:17:6,46 --> 0:17:9,62
You'll find that some crucial intelligence matters a lot.

495
0:17:9,62 --> 0:17:11,42
These can be obtained through them.

496
0:17:11,42 --> 0:17:13,42
So, in the realm of international politics,

497
0:17:13,42 --> 0:17:15,74
If it’s not something that directly impacts our interests,

498
0:17:15,74 --> 0:17:17,58
A lot of things can be negotiated and traded.

499
0:17:17,58 --> 0:17:19,81
Some say that conscience shouldn’t be traded,

500
0:17:19,81 --> 0:17:21,69
But in the context of international politics,

501
0:17:21,69 --> 0:17:22,67
Often times,

502
0:17:22,67 --> 0:17:24,21
It has nothing to do with conscience,

503
0:17:24,21 --> 0:17:26,2
It’s all about power.

504
0:17:26,2 --> 0:17:30,0
No one really has the capability to deploy ground forces into Gaza.

505
0:17:30,0 --> 0:17:32,16
So the Gaza issue seems to be in a deadlock.

506
0:17:32,16 --> 0:17:33,12
All we can do is sympathize.

507
0:17:33,12 --> 0:17:35,4
Or, at best, accept their refugees.

508
0:17:35,4 --> 0:17:37,919
Of course, we all know what accepting Palestinian refugees entails.

509
0:17:37,919 --> 0:17:38,899
Everyone is aware of that.

510
0:17:38,899 --> 0:17:39,979
Many historical events

511
0:17:39,979 --> 0:17:42,419
can be researched online to understand what has transpired.

512
0:17:42,419 --> 0:17:44,259
Why Arab countries are sometimes reluctant to accept them

513
0:17:44,259 --> 0:17:46,79
The situation of Palestinian refugees is also intertwined.

514
0:17:46,79 --> 0:17:48,63
So, in many cases,

515
0:17:48,63 --> 0:17:50,59
the Middle East issue is very complex.

516
0:17:50,59 --> 0:17:51,55
There are sectarian conflicts,

517
0:17:51,55 --> 0:17:52,35
ethnic conflicts,

518
0:17:52,35 --> 0:17:53,19
state conflicts,

519
0:17:53,19 --> 0:17:54,27
and tribal disputes.

520
0:17:54,27 --> 0:17:55,879
It's a powder keg.

521
0:17:55,879 --> 0:17:57,599
But if you don't get involved,

522
0:17:57,599 --> 0:17:58,619
don't observe,

523
0:17:58,619 --> 0:18:0,4
in many cases,

524
0:18:0,4 --> 0:18:2,64
it doesn't reflect the responsibility of a modern major power.

525
0:18:2,64 --> 0:18:3,46
So,

526
0:18:3,46 --> 0:18:4,12
no matter what,

527
0:18:4,12 --> 0:18:5,28
in terms of diplomacy,

528
0:18:5,28 --> 0:18:7,99
I think we should be in line with the country's stance.

529
0:18:7,99 --> 0:18:8,97
We are just ordinary people,

530
0:18:8,97 --> 0:18:9,35
right?

531
0:18:9,35 --> 0:18:11,49
We don't have much influence on foreign policy decisions,

532
0:18:11,49 --> 0:18:12,5
military decisions,

533
0:18:12,5 --> 0:18:15,38
or various intelligence decisions.

534
0:18:15,38 --> 0:18:16,46
But no matter what,

535
0:18:16,46 --> 0:18:18,34
from a civilian perspective,

536
0:18:18,34 --> 0:18:20,52
I think maintaining contact is important,

537
0:18:20,52 --> 0:18:23,12
keeping a certain level of foundation,

538
0:18:23,12 --> 0:18:24,74
not being completely adversarial.

539
0:18:24,74 --> 0:18:28,24
This is a very, very delicate approach,

540
0:18:28,24 --> 0:18:30,5
how to put it,

541
0:18:30,5 --> 0:18:31,51
a brilliant move.

542
0:18:31,51 --> 0:18:33,29
If you completely cut ties,

543
0:18:33,29 --> 0:18:34,17
they might fully align with the West,

544
0:18:34,17 --> 0:18:35,62
which would certainly become a major threat to us.

545
0:18:35,62 --> 0:18:37,8
So that's how it is.

546
0:18:37,8 --> 0:18:39,4
If you put it in English, it's like,

547
0:18:39,4 --> 0:18:41,44
‘keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer.’

548
0:18:41,44 --> 0:18:43,8
You need to maintain a closer relationship with your enemies,

549
0:18:43,8 --> 0:18:45,3
especially potential enemies.

550
0:18:45,3 --> 0:18:48,2
But Israel also understands this,

551
0:18:48,2 --> 0:18:49,94
we have significant interests in the Middle East,

552
0:18:49,94 --> 0:18:52,35
especially in energy supply from Iran and Saudi Arabia,

553
0:18:52,35 --> 0:18:54,71
which is crucial for us.

554
0:18:54,71 --> 0:18:57,95
Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Russia are the main options,

555
0:18:57,95 --> 0:18:59,87
and our international relations with Russia are particularly delicate.

556
0:18:59,87 --> 0:19:3,8
So it can't be described in simple terms.

557
0:19:3,8 --> 0:19:5,8
In international politics,

558
0:19:5,8 --> 0:19:6,76
there's not much talk of emotion,

559
0:19:6,76 --> 0:19:9,57
it's more about the exchange of interests.

560
0:19:9,57 --> 0:19:10,85
So if you're interested in international relations in the future,

561
0:19:10,85 --> 0:19:11,93
I hope you can spare some time,

562
0:19:11,93 --> 0:19:13,59
and consider pursuing a master's degree in this field,

563
0:19:13,59 --> 0:19:16,53
to contribute to the prosperity and strength of our country in this area.

564
0:19:16,53 --> 0:19:17,17
And to be honest,

565
0:19:17,17 --> 0:19:18,53
many things in international politics require a very cold and harsh perspective,

566
0:19:18,53 --> 0:19:21,65
because the world operates on the laws of the jungle.
