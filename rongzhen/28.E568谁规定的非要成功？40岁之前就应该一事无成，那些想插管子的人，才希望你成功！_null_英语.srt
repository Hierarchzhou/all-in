0:0:0,62 --> 0:0:2,54
Hi, this is episode 568.

2
0:0:2,54 --> 0:0:4,88
This time, Brother Rong has to be here.

3
0:0:4,88 --> 0:0:6,42
Because today is August 1st.

4
0:0:8,29 --> 0:0:10,37
In this episode, we're going to talk about

5
0:0:10,37 --> 0:0:11,96
We're doing a second update today.

6
0:0:11,96 --> 0:0:13,54
Why do we have to do a second update today?

7
0:0:13,54 --> 0:0:18,28
Actually, the last two episodes have received a strong response from the audience.

8
0:0:18,28 --> 0:0:20,24
Today, we're going to discuss one topic,

9
0:0:20,24 --> 0:0:22,14
which is, what if we don't succeed?

10
0:0:22,14 --> 0:0:23,0
Right?

11
0:0:23,0 --> 0:0:27,6
You'll notice that many people in this world force you to study hard when you're in school

12
0:0:27,6 --> 0:0:28,72
Don't play around

13
0:0:28,72 --> 0:0:30,32
And then work hard when you start working

14
0:0:30,32 --> 0:0:32,789
Don't indulge yourself

15
0:0:32,789 --> 0:0:36,809
You'll find that many people who advise you to do so

16
0:0:36,809 --> 0:0:41,209
It's because they can benefit from the value of your labor

17
0:0:41,209 --> 0:0:42,689
It's that simple

18
0:0:42,689 --> 0:0:45,389
Whether it's the value of your work or the taxes you pay

19
0:0:45,389 --> 0:0:45,949
No matter what

20
0:0:45,949 --> 0:0:47,189
you've made contributions to society

21
0:0:47,189 --> 0:0:50,84
and to your boss, right?

22
0:0:50,84 --> 0:0:52,98
but the more you contribute

23
0:0:52,98 --> 0:0:54,16
the harder you work

24
0:0:54,16 --> 0:0:55,58
so in many ways

25
0:0:55,58 --> 0:0:57,8
we talk about what success is

26
0:0:57,8 --> 0:0:59,62
Mr. Wang Shuo put it well

27
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:1,6
it's about outdoing others

28
0:1:1,6 --> 0:1:1,98
Make some money

29
0:1:1,98 --> 0:1:3,58
Then let everyone know

30
0:1:3,58 --> 0:1:6,49
Then you'll find that this is a bottomless pit

31
0:1:6,49 --> 0:1:8,29
Take Bill Gates, for example

32
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:9,11
Elon Musk

33
0:1:9,11 --> 0:1:10,49
He could, with his eyes closed

34
0:1:10,49 --> 0:1:11,6
In an instant

35
0:1:11,6 --> 0:1:14,16
Millions or even tens of millions of dollars appear

36
0:1:14,16 --> 0:1:16,27
Because they have tens or even hundreds of billions

37
0:1:16,27 --> 0:1:17,47
At that moment

38
0:1:17,47 --> 0:1:18,77
it was the interest he earned back then

39
0:1:18,77 --> 0:1:20,45
he could make so much money

40
0:1:20,45 --> 0:1:23,2
but you might not earn as much in your entire life as he does in a day

41
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:24,94
does that mean your life is meaningless?

42
0:1:24,94 --> 0:1:28,32
besides, who says the meaning of life is about making money?

43
0:1:28,32 --> 0:1:29,42
right?

44
0:1:29,42 --> 0:1:31,98
why do many people feel that making money is so important?

45
0:1:31,98 --> 0:1:34,55
why does it make you feel this kind of pressure?

46
0:1:34,55 --> 0:1:37,27
It's because he can take the money you earn

47
0:1:37,27 --> 0:1:38,55
and transfer it to others

48
0:1:38,55 --> 0:1:40,61
who then engage in spending activities

49
0:1:40,61 --> 0:1:41,71
and make a profit

50
0:1:41,71 --> 0:1:43,97
for example, your partner

51
0:1:43,97 --> 0:1:44,95
wants you to earn more money

52
0:1:44,95 --> 0:1:47,7
because they hope to spend the money you earn

53
0:1:47,7 --> 0:1:48,51
if you don't give them the money

54
0:1:48,51 --> 0:1:50,52
they won't expect you to earn more

55
0:1:50,52 --> 0:1:51,52
You're like Brother Rong

56
0:1:51,52 --> 0:1:54,2
I never spend money on people around me

57
0:1:54,2 --> 0:1:56,8
Who would wish for me to become wealthy?

58
0:1:56,8 --> 0:1:58,98
If I keep giving money to others all the time

59
0:1:58,98 --> 0:2:0,26
Always spending money on others

60
0:2:0,26 --> 0:2:1,82
Everyone would wish me to get rich

61
0:2:1,82 --> 0:2:3,8
But is wishing me to get rich necessarily a good thing?

62
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:6,4
Because they could benefit from me

63
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:9,139
So you should be a person who doesn't part with a penny

64
0:2:9,139 --> 0:2:11,899
I wouldn't pluck a single hair to benefit the world, ha

65
0:2:11,899 --> 0:2:12,999
I'll pull out one spear

66
0:2:12,999 --> 0:2:14,419
I let others benefit

67
0:2:14,419 --> 0:2:15,439
but I wouldn't do that

68
0:2:15,439 --> 0:2:16,139
So, to put it simply

69
0:2:16,139 --> 0:2:19,99
it means you shouldn't strive to be useful to others

70
0:2:19,99 --> 0:2:21,9
or to society

71
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:23,45
or to the world, right

72
0:2:23,45 --> 0:2:24,13
isn't that so

73
0:2:24,13 --> 0:2:26,13
Why do you have to be that kind of person?

74
0:2:26,13 --> 0:2:28,99
You only need 2200 calories a day.

75
0:2:28,99 --> 0:2:30,85
You need a warm room.

76
0:2:30,85 --> 0:2:32,43
Having a bed to sleep in is enough.

77
0:2:32,43 --> 0:2:33,91
This is not hard to achieve.

78
0:2:33,91 --> 0:2:36,1
Getting food itself isn't difficult.

79
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:37,48
It doesn't cost much.

80
0:2:37,48 --> 0:2:41,56
So, in reality, a lot of extra income is unnecessary.

81
0:2:41,56 --> 0:2:43,9
You have a few thousand now.

82
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:45,8
As a college student

83
0:2:45,8 --> 0:2:46,37
or even a high school student

84
0:2:46,37 --> 0:2:49,7
you've learned to ride a motorcycle

85
0:2:49,7 --> 0:2:52,91
and then bought a second-hand motorcycle for around four to five thousand yuan

86
0:2:52,91 --> 0:2:56,25
motorcycle training can range from a few hundred to over a thousand yuan

87
0:2:56,25 --> 0:2:57,769
and then you start motorcycle touring

88
0:2:57,769 --> 0:2:59,89
when you reach a destination

89
0:2:59,89 --> 0:2:59,769
if you run out of money

90
0:2:59,769 --> 0:3:0,769
you can do a few days of food delivery

91
0:3:0,769 --> 0:3:1,849
That's just perfect.

92
0:3:1,849 --> 0:3:3,69
Just be a master of three harmonies.

93
0:3:3,69 --> 0:3:5,3
Bro Rong isn't speaking sarcastically.

94
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:6,39
Bro Rong is telling you again.

95
0:3:6,39 --> 0:3:9,21
It's because society sets such high expectations for people.

96
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:10,74
That's often the case.

97
0:3:10,74 --> 0:3:12,78
If you haven't made a name for yourself by 30,

98
0:3:12,78 --> 0:3:14,1
it feels like a crime.

99
0:3:14,1 --> 0:3:15,74
The other day, a young guy told me

100
0:3:15,74 --> 0:3:17,38
Bro Rong, I've been watching your videos for two years.

101
0:3:17,38 --> 0:3:19,26
But I haven't made much money.

102
0:3:19,26 --> 0:3:20,82
I feel really ashamed.

103
0:3:20,82 --> 0:3:22,52
What's going on, buddy?

104
0:3:22,52 --> 0:3:24,4
What's so strange about that?

105
0:3:24,4 --> 0:3:24,62
Besides,

106
0:3:24,62 --> 0:3:25,66
how old are you now?

107
0:3:25,66 --> 0:3:27,41
You're only in your twenties.

108
0:3:27,41 --> 0:3:28,97
He thinks I'm already 25.

109
0:3:28,97 --> 0:3:29,78
a complete failure

110
0:3:29,78 --> 0:3:30,42
Hey buddy

111
0:3:30,42 --> 0:3:32,54
Think about Brother Rong, at 37

112
0:3:32,54 --> 0:3:34,5
He was still a complete failure at 36

113
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:36,91
But at 37, he suddenly took off

114
0:3:36,91 --> 0:3:38,25
and then he made it

115
0:3:38,25 --> 0:3:40,89
Does that mean my 37 years of life have been meaningless?

116
0:3:40,89 --> 0:3:43,5
Man, back then, you can imagine how frustrated I was

117
0:3:43,5 --> 0:3:44,35
I really want to start over too

118
0:3:44,35 --> 0:3:46,5
I was really struggling with my thoughts back then

119
0:3:46,5 --> 0:3:47,22
It was particularly tough

120
0:3:47,22 --> 0:3:49,83
But I managed to keep a positive attitude

121
0:3:49,83 --> 0:3:52,17
I believe there will be opportunities in the future

122
0:3:52,17 --> 0:3:53,77
There will be a time when I can shine

123
0:3:53,77 --> 0:3:55,88
Right now, I'm just building up my foundation

124
0:3:55,88 --> 0:3:57,38
The opportunities will definitely come

125
0:3:57,38 --> 0:3:59,4
I started at the age of 20

126
0:3:59,4 --> 0:4:2,24
Back then, I was already in my second or third year of university

127
0:4:2,24 --> 0:4:4,37
So we were really anxious back then

128
0:4:4,37 --> 0:4:5,39
21 years old

129
0:4:5,39 --> 0:4:6,23
22 years old

130
0:4:6,23 --> 0:4:7,1
23 years old

131
0:4:7,1 --> 0:4:7,79
24 years old

132
0:4:7,79 --> 0:4:8,55
25 years old

133
0:4:8,55 --> 0:4:9,27
26 years old

134
0:4:9,27 --> 0:4:10,1
27 years old

135
0:4:10,1 --> 0:4:10,73
28 years old

136
0:4:10,73 --> 0:4:12,829
I hadn't succeeded by the time I was 29

137
0:4:12,829 --> 0:4:14,109
I hadn't made much money at all

138
0:4:14,109 --> 0:4:14,689
right?

139
0:4:14,689 --> 0:4:15,829
by the time I hit 30

140
0:4:15,829 --> 0:4:16,669
and 31

141
0:4:16,669 --> 0:4:18,81
I started making some money by writing papers for others

142
0:4:18,81 --> 0:4:19,77
at 32

143
0:4:19,77 --> 0:4:20,51
33

144
0:4:20,51 --> 0:4:21,23
and 34

145
0:4:21,23 --> 0:4:21,95
Thirty-five years old

146
0:4:21,95 --> 0:4:22,57
Thirty-six years old

147
0:4:22,57 --> 0:4:23,39
Thirty-seven years old

148
0:4:23,39 --> 0:4:25,35
By the time I was thirty-seven, my kids were six

149
0:4:25,35 --> 0:4:27,24
I finally got it

150
0:4:27,24 --> 0:4:29,68
You could say it was a significant economic success

151
0:4:29,68 --> 0:4:32,52
Later on, things gradually progressed to the point where I didn't have to work anymore

152
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:34,68
That was only a few years ago, right?

153
0:4:34,68 --> 0:4:35,299
Right?

154
0:4:35,299 --> 0:4:36,979
It's just a matter of turning 41

155
0:4:36,979 --> 0:4:38,499
It's just 34 years down the road

156
0:4:38,499 --> 0:4:41,38
So, we're talking about the efforts made so many years ago

157
0:4:41,38 --> 0:4:42,52
Things will turn for the better after hitting rock bottom

158
0:4:42,52 --> 0:4:44,82
So, a lot of the time, people instill these ideas in you

159
0:4:44,82 --> 0:4:46,52
You have to achieve certain things by the time you're 25

160
0:4:46,52 --> 0:4:48,62
Then, during your graduate studies, you have to do this and that

161
0:4:48,62 --> 0:4:50,48
You have to have accomplished certain things by 30

162
0:4:50,48 --> 0:4:51,58
And men have to be good

163
0:4:51,58 --> 0:4:53,44
You need to be making a million a year

164
0:4:53,44 --> 0:4:54,8
And have savings in the tens of millions

165
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:56,32
And give you a few million for the dowry

166
0:4:56,32 --> 0:4:57,6
And buy you some luxury car

167
0:4:57,6 --> 0:4:58,46
Why should I?

168
0:4:58,46 --> 0:4:59,19
Buddy

169
0:4:59,19 --> 0:5:1,51
Why should I earn money for you to spend?

170
0:5:1,51 --> 0:5:4,11
Why should I earn money for you to spend?

171
0:5:4,11 --> 0:5:5,17
Who are you anyway?

172
0:5:5,17 --> 0:5:7,85
Are you trying to trade your measly stuff with me?

173
0:5:7,85 --> 0:5:9,13
I've earned this money.

174
0:5:9,13 --> 0:5:10,33
What can't I trade for?

175
0:5:10,33 --> 0:5:10,65
Right?

176
0:5:10,65 --> 0:5:13,7
Why do you have to force me to work?

177
0:5:13,7 --> 0:5:13,75
Right?

178
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:16,83
And many of my followers often chat with me on WeChat about their daily lives.

179
0:5:16,83 --> 0:5:20,43
They sometimes feel really inadequate, or like failures.

180
0:5:20,43 --> 0:5:21,97
Or they feel that way by the time they hit 30.

181
0:5:21,97 --> 0:5:23,49
So what happens when you turn 30?

182
0:5:23,49 --> 0:5:24,89
You haven't even hit 40 yet.

183
0:5:24,89 --> 0:5:31,75
Actually, the typical life path is that things start to stabilize around 40.

184
0:5:31,75 --> 0:5:34,9
It's usually around 45 or 46 when you can afford a house.

185
0:5:34,9 --> 0:5:36,3
By the time you're 50,

186
0:5:36,3 --> 0:5:38,44
your career is likely to have taken off.

187
0:5:38,44 --> 0:5:39,12
At 60,

188
0:5:39,12 --> 0:5:40,1
around 65,

189
0:5:40,1 --> 0:5:42,21
entrepreneurs often start their ventures at 50.

190
0:5:42,21 --> 0:5:43,43
Work until retirement at 70

191
0:5:43,43 --> 0:5:45,25
That's the typical attitude of entrepreneurs

192
0:5:45,25 --> 0:5:47,41
Look at any entrepreneur, they're all bosses

193
0:5:47,41 --> 0:5:50,15
They become bosses because they've aged into the role

194
0:5:50,15 --> 0:5:52,31
How many young bosses are there?

195
0:5:52,31 --> 0:5:53,5
Right?

196
0:5:53,5 --> 0:5:54,76
Not many

197
0:5:54,76 --> 0:5:57,84
Most of the time, you see the rich second generations

198
0:5:57,84 --> 0:6:0,1
Or through some other means

199
0:6:0,1 --> 0:6:0,82
Made it big

200
0:6:0,82 --> 0:6:2,21
That's not normal

201
0:6:2,21 --> 0:6:4,61
Most people strike late

202
0:6:4,61 --> 0:6:8,17
Most people only start making money when they're much older

203
0:6:8,17 --> 0:6:10,51
Only start buying houses when they're much older

204
0:6:10,51 --> 0:6:13,13
Why do so many people urge you to buy a house

205
0:6:13,13 --> 0:6:14,51
Push you into a mortgage

206
0:6:14,51 --> 0:6:16,38
Because he built houses

207
0:6:16,38 --> 0:6:17,4
He built

208
0:6:17,4 --> 0:6:18,82
Aren't you going to buy it?

209
0:6:18,82 --> 0:6:19,48
Right?

210
0:6:19,48 --> 0:6:21,8
He bought the house through you.

211
0:6:21,8 --> 0:6:23,3
He took the money for himself.

212
0:6:23,3 --> 0:6:24,6
So what are we going to do?

213
0:6:24,6 --> 0:6:26,26
Isn't he planning to spend it overseas?

214
0:6:26,26 --> 0:6:28,84
Isn't he planning to send his child abroad?

215
0:6:28,84 --> 0:6:30,96
Isn't he planning to transfer the money overseas?

216
0:6:30,96 --> 0:6:32,2
Right?

217
0:6:32,2 --> 0:6:34,62
So, the taxation for the supporters

218
0:6:34,62 --> 0:6:36,84
the national construction of the supporters, huh

219
0:6:36,84 --> 0:6:38,14
So this logic is quite amusing

220
0:6:38,14 --> 0:6:41,17
Why should I suffer so you can enjoy the benefits

221
0:6:41,17 --> 0:6:42,59
That's how the logic goes

222
0:6:42,59 --> 0:6:45,29
Why should I suffer so you can enjoy the benefits

223
0:6:45,29 --> 0:6:47,43
Why should I have to succeed

224
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:48,95
When I succeed

225
0:6:48,95 --> 0:6:50,99
When my salary reaches a million

226
0:6:50,99 --> 0:6:54,3
I've created so much value for this company and for society.

227
0:6:54,3 --> 0:6:56,84
How many people have fattened themselves by sucking my blood?

228
0:6:56,84 --> 0:6:59,4
When I seem to have succeeded, with a car and a house,

229
0:6:59,4 --> 0:7:1,46
the local government is the happiest.

230
0:7:1,46 --> 0:7:3,289
relying on land developers and banks,

231
0:7:3,289 --> 0:7:5,149
and those car salespeople,

232
0:7:5,149 --> 0:7:6,449
the car manufacturers,

233
0:7:6,449 --> 0:7:7,85
they keep getting richer,

234
0:7:7,85 --> 0:7:9,41
while I just drive the car.

235
0:7:9,41 --> 0:7:11,51
I just wanted these bricks and tiles.

236
0:7:11,51 --> 0:7:13,19
Then I want to live in this place.

237
0:7:13,19 --> 0:7:15,34
Would those developers live in such a place?

238
0:7:15,34 --> 0:7:16,2
They wouldn’t.

239
0:7:16,2 --> 0:7:17,6
They’d live in Beverly Hills.

240
0:7:17,6 --> 0:7:18,58
They’d live in Vancouver.

241
0:7:18,58 --> 0:7:20,6
They’d live in Los Angeles.

242
0:7:20,6 --> 0:7:22,99
People who wouldn’t live here,

243
0:7:22,99 --> 0:7:23,139
nor would their children.

244
0:7:23,139 --> 0:7:24,419
Nor will you receive an education here

245
0:7:24,419 --> 0:7:26,659
So you think you’re living a life of luxury

246
0:7:26,659 --> 0:7:28,97
You think your life is filled with cars and houses

247
0:7:28,97 --> 0:7:30,85
Borrowing again wouldn’t be hard

248
0:7:30,85 --> 0:7:32,93
You always resort to borrowing

249
0:7:32,93 --> 0:7:33,55
To spend money

250
0:7:33,55 --> 0:7:34,95
Is that what happiness looks like?

251
0:7:34,95 --> 0:7:37,73
Why do you have to succeed?

252
0:7:38,189 --> 0:7:39,669
Just for the sake of mating and reproduction?'

253
0:7:39,669 --> 0:7:40,749
There are plenty of people out there

254
0:7:40,749 --> 0:7:41,509
Let others mate

255
0:7:41,509 --> 0:7:42,529
Let others reproduce

256
0:7:42,529 --> 0:7:44,629
Can I just focus on living my own life well

257
0:7:44,629 --> 0:7:46,2
I make myself happy

258
0:7:46,2 --> 0:7:47,9
I just make myself happy, that's it

259
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:48,9
Happiness isn't hard to come by

260
0:7:49,9 --> 0:7:50,74
I'll have some pickled food

261
0:7:50,74 --> 0:7:51,38
And grill some barbecue

262
0:7:51,38 --> 0:7:52,1
Have a beer

263
0:7:52,1 --> 0:7:52,77
Have a sip

264
0:7:52,77 --> 0:7:55,15
A few slices of cucumber and I'm happy

265
0:7:55,15 --> 0:7:55,53
Right?

266
0:7:55,53 --> 0:7:56,39
I'll take a stroll

267
0:7:56,39 --> 0:7:57,33
If you're going on a motorcycle trip

268
0:7:57,33 --> 0:7:58,37
I'm happy

269
0:7:58,37 --> 0:8:0,87
I'll go to a concert or watch a stand-up show, right?

270
0:8:0,87 --> 0:8:3,1
Check out some games adapted from manga, shall we?

271
0:8:3,1 --> 0:8:6,299
Then watching live gaming streams is quite enjoyable.

272
0:8:6,299 --> 0:8:7,459
Happiness isn't hard to come by.

273
0:8:7,459 --> 0:8:8,839
Why shouldn't indulging in simple pleasures be okay?

274
0:8:8,839 --> 0:8:9,939
Why can't I play games?

275
0:8:11,79 --> 0:8:12,379
Brother Rong does two things every day,

276
0:8:12,379 --> 0:8:13,379
one is watching videos on Bilibili,

277
0:8:13,379 --> 0:8:16,5
and the other is playing games on the TV or computer.

278
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:17,7
Just these two things.

279
0:8:17,7 --> 0:8:18,57
Of course, I also read books,

280
0:8:18,57 --> 0:8:19,77
and I study too.

281
0:8:19,77 --> 0:8:23,7
But the time I spend reading, studying, and working out combined doesn't exceed an hour.

282
0:8:23,7 --> 0:8:25,289
Most of my time is spent watching videos,

283
0:8:25,289 --> 0:8:27,129
and most of my time is spent playing games.

284
0:8:27,129 --> 0:8:28,129
I'm just enjoying life,

285
0:8:28,129 --> 0:8:29,44
it's that simple.

286
0:8:29,44 --> 0:8:31,32
It's not that I only do this when I have money,

287
0:8:31,32 --> 0:8:32,88
I do this even when I don't have money.

288
0:8:32,88 --> 0:8:37,329
I've never thought that success is something you have to strive for.

289
0:8:37,649 --> 0:8:39,969
I've never been someone who constantly pushes myself,

290
0:8:39,969 --> 0:8:40,609
constantly pushing myself,

291
0:8:40,609 --> 0:8:42,249
to achieve success.

292
0:8:42,249 --> 0:8:43,529
And it wasn't until I was 37 that my luck turned around.

293
0:8:43,529 --> 0:8:46,59
It's not that I wasn't working hard before 37,

294
0:8:46,59 --> 0:8:47,74
I just didn't succeed.

295
0:8:47,74 --> 0:8:48,88
When I was 36,

296
0:8:48,88 --> 0:8:51,46
or 35, I started to not push myself as much.

297
0:8:51,46 --> 0:8:52,92
I think you have to wait for opportunities,

298
0:8:52,92 --> 0:8:54,22
I think that's just how it is.

299
0:8:54,22 --> 0:8:56,73
When the opportunity comes, you seize it and that's it.

300
0:8:56,73 --> 0:8:57,13
Right?

301
0:8:57,13 --> 0:8:58,45
You can't always be like that,

302
0:8:58,45 --> 0:8:59,37
when you don't want to sleep,

303
0:8:59,37 --> 0:9:0,49
lying in bed won't help you fall asleep,

304
0:9:0,49 --> 0:9:1,45
you won't be able to sleep anyway.

305
0:9:1,45 --> 0:9:2,6
Right?

306
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:3,56
So a lot of times, it's just like that.

307
0:9:3,56 --> 0:9:6,6
Don't let others' expectations sway you.

308
0:9:6,6 --> 0:9:8,8
Remember what Brother Rong says, if you're not successful,

309
0:9:8,8 --> 0:9:9,32
then that's just fine.
