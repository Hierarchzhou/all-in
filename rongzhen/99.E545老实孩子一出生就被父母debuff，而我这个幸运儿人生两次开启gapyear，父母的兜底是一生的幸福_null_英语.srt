1
0:0:0,78 --> 0:0:5,12
So today, let's continue talking about the power of faith, shall we?

2
0:0:5,12 --> 0:0:8,95
The so-called power of faith is the secret to success in life.

3
0:0:8,95 --> 0:0:11,21
It lies in intense self-deception.

4
0:0:11,21 --> 0:0:14,61
Why is intense self-deception so important?

5
0:0:14,61 --> 0:0:15,93
Look at me, do I deceive myself?

6
0:0:15,93 --> 0:0:17,89
Do I usually deceive myself?

7
0:0:18,17 --> 0:0:19,33
There are fewer scammers nowadays.

8
0:0:19,33 --> 0:0:21,33
But I used to deceive a lot of people.

9
0:0:21,33 --> 0:0:22,69
How can I put it?

10
0:0:22,69 --> 0:0:24,89
When we talk about a person's life

11
0:0:24,89 --> 0:0:27,61
and the many things they experience

12
0:0:27,61 --> 0:0:30,39
it largely depends on the path their parents set for them

13
0:0:30,39 --> 0:0:32,23
You could say that the parents you were born to

14
0:0:32,23 --> 0:0:35,17
have already determined most of your life circumstances

15
0:0:35,17 --> 0:0:37,62
So why would you deceive yourself?

16
0:0:37,62 --> 0:0:38,38
Deceiving yourself

17
0:0:38,38 --> 0:0:43,39
is about changing those foundational elements

18
0:0:43,39 --> 0:0:46,41
the basic settings of your life

19
0:0:47,77 --> 0:0:49,73
What was your original operating system like?

20
0:0:49,73 --> 0:0:52,91
Now, Brother Rong will give you a new one, right?

21
0:0:53,39 --> 0:0:56,23
I have always been that way.

22
0:0:56,23 --> 0:0:58,81
I wouldn't say I'm narcissistic.

23
0:0:58,81 --> 0:1:1,48
But I am in a state of brimming confidence.

24
0:1:1,48 --> 0:1:4,4
I've always believed I'm a chosen one.

25
0:1:4,4 --> 0:1:6,12
Why do I think I'm a chosen one?

26
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:7,0
It's really interesting.

27
0:1:7,0 --> 0:1:8,4
Let me tell you why.

28
0:1:8,4 --> 0:1:10,9
Because there's no logic to it

29
0:1:10,9 --> 0:1:14,42
It's just that my name, when broken down into strokes

30
0:1:14,42 --> 0:1:17,99
Happens to be six and one five

31
0:1:20,83 --> 0:1:24,52
I was born on a stormy night

32
0:1:24,52 --> 0:1:27,2
The day was calm and peaceful

33
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:28,58
But it was also overcast

34
0:1:28,58 --> 0:1:30,78
At exactly three o'clock in the morning

35
0:1:30,78 --> 0:1:31,5
When I was born

36
0:1:31,5 --> 0:1:32,98
A bolt of lightning struck

37
0:1:32,98 --> 0:1:36,66
Then the rain started pouring down.

38
0:1:36,66 --> 0:1:41,4
Ever since then, I've been scared of gunshots,

39
0:1:41,4 --> 0:1:42,8
fireworks sounds,

40
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:42,56
thunder,

41
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:43,38
I get really frightened.

42
0:1:43,38 --> 0:1:45,28
Because I was startled right after I was born.

43
0:1:45,28 --> 0:1:45,72
You know?

44
0:1:45,72 --> 0:1:47,24
It was exactly three o'clock,

45
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:50,46
when a baby boy was suddenly born at Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

46
0:1:50,46 --> 0:1:52,59
Then, after my forties, I look like this.

47
0:1:52,59 --> 0:1:54,43
If you think there's anything suspicious about this,

48
0:1:54,43 --> 0:1:57,93
it's not about what this object symbolizes as a good omen itself,

49
0:1:57,93 --> 0:2:0,14
that's not important.

50
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:5,14
What matters is that I believe it to be a sign of good fortune.

51
0:2:5,14 --> 0:2:8,66
And after facing all sorts of dangers,

52
0:2:8,66 --> 0:2:9,46
years later,

53
0:2:9,46 --> 0:2:11,53
I found that this thing is truly real,

54
0:2:11,53 --> 0:2:12,93
it has become real.

55
0:2:12,93 --> 0:2:13,59
Got it?

56
0:2:13,59 --> 0:2:17,19
The crucial part is when you start uncovering some secrets on your own.

57
0:2:17,19 --> 0:2:18,67
You have to fool yourself a bit.

58
0:2:18,67 --> 0:2:22,409
When you encounter some kind of divine hint or revelation,

59
0:2:22,409 --> 0:2:23,749
or witness some miracle,

60
0:2:23,749 --> 0:2:24,889
or whatever it might be,

61
0:2:24,889 --> 0:2:27,109
you need to use these moments to motivate yourself.

62
0:2:27,109 --> 0:2:28,579
To encourage yourself.

63
0:2:28,579 --> 0:2:29,979
This is really important.

64
0:2:29,979 --> 0:2:32,159
The key is to convince yourself.

65
0:2:32,159 --> 0:2:36,2
When you truly believe you can do anything,

66
0:2:36,2 --> 0:2:36,66
that you’re invincible,

67
0:2:36,66 --> 0:2:38,54
and then the spherical lightning appears,

68
0:2:38,54 --> 0:2:41,1
at that point, you are in an unbeatable state.

69
0:2:41,1 --> 0:2:44,63
That’s why those with NPD, the narcissists, are so powerful.

70
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:48,96
Sometimes they eliminate others through their strength,

71
0:2:48,96 --> 0:2:52,5
but more often, they overwhelm others with their presence.

72
0:2:52,5 --> 0:2:54,61
So this is crucial.

73
0:2:55,28 --> 0:2:56,46
No matter what

74
0:2:56,46 --> 0:2:58,68
if you look at my life as a whole

75
0:2:58,68 --> 0:3:1,95
you wouldn't think it was particularly successful

76
0:3:1,95 --> 0:3:3,57
or someone with a distinguished reputation

77
0:3:3,57 --> 0:3:4,61
you wouldn't think so

78
0:3:4,61 --> 0:3:7,3
but I've lived a carefree life

79
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:8,98
very fulfilling, right?

80
0:3:8,98 --> 0:3:10,24
if something wasn't done

81
0:3:10,24 --> 0:3:11,42
there's nothing that can be done about it

82
0:3:11,42 --> 0:3:15,59
It's because my parents have always had my back that I've been able to live such a carefree and adventurous life.

83
0:3:15,59 --> 0:3:17,98
My parents have provided me with a lot of support, understanding, and help.

84
0:3:17,98 --> 0:3:21,72
So I think, if this person...

85
0:3:21,72 --> 0:3:24,99
If the idea that good deeds from our ancestors really do have an impact...

86
0:3:24,99 --> 0:3:26,759
If we believe that the good karma from our ancestors is real...

87
0:3:26,759 --> 0:3:29,56
I feel like I was born into this world to enjoy it, to play.

88
0:3:29,56 --> 0:3:33,92
To truly experience life in all its facets.

89
0:3:33,92 --> 0:3:36,769
But I have some friends...

90
0:3:36,769 --> 0:3:38,889
But I have some friends

91
0:3:38,889 --> 0:3:40,529
Like other UPloaders

92
0:3:40,529 --> 0:3:42,83
I recently got to know two UPloaders

93
0:3:42,83 --> 0:3:44,81
one is a Shanghai migrant

94
0:3:44,81 --> 0:3:47,67
and the other is a Beijing migrant

95
0:3:47,67 --> 0:3:50,37
both of them are truly remarkable

96
0:3:50,37 --> 0:3:52,63
having left their home provinces after the college entrance exam

97
0:3:52,63 --> 0:3:54,9
to study in Beijing

98
0:3:54,9 --> 0:3:55,15
and to study in Shanghai

99
0:3:55,15 --> 0:3:57,51
and after years of arduous effort

100
0:3:57,51 --> 0:3:59,23
Parents still have NPD

101
0:3:59,23 --> 0:4:0,57
it's still quite terrifying

102
0:4:0,57 --> 0:4:3,33
and in the marriage, one person

103
0:4:3,33 --> 0:4:5,79
isn't understood by the other

104
0:4:5,79 --> 0:4:7,59
and the one not in the marriage

105
0:4:7,59 --> 0:4:9,59
is relying on their cat for companionship

106
0:4:9,59 --> 0:4:12,82
and the fate, well, you can imagine how dire it is

107
0:4:12,82 --> 0:4:16,5
it's not just about seeing your fate clearly

108
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:17,18
or anything like that

109
0:4:17,18 --> 0:4:18,94
Or put it another way, change the mindset

110
0:4:18,94 --> 0:4:19,909
Change the approach

111
0:4:19,909 --> 0:4:21,749
If I were to face those hardships

112
0:4:21,749 --> 0:4:22,549
I would be doomed

113
0:4:22,549 --> 0:4:22,989
You know that, right?

114
0:4:22,989 --> 0:4:24,2
Definitely doomed

115
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:25,34
But that's how it is

116
0:4:25,34 --> 0:4:27,54
If you want to maximize his transformation

117
0:4:27,54 --> 0:4:28,94
You have to believe in yourself

118
0:4:28,94 --> 0:4:29,94
Because of these things

119
0:4:29,94 --> 0:4:33,91
These kids from well-off families are usually very confident in themselves

120
0:4:33,91 --> 0:4:37,21
You just can't afford to have any more debuffs in your life

121
0:4:37,21 --> 0:4:38,33
To be honest

122
0:4:38,33 --> 0:4:39,81
Compared to these two friends of mine

123
0:4:39,81 --> 0:4:42,63
My life has been incredibly fortunate

124
0:4:42,63 --> 0:4:44,21
Just how fortunate, you ask?

125
0:4:44,21 --> 0:4:45,419
Let me tell you

126
0:4:45,419 --> 0:4:47,239
I spent four years in junior high school

127
0:4:47,239 --> 0:4:49,29
I took a year off in my third year of junior high.

128
0:4:49,29 --> 0:4:50,95
I attended school for two semesters in my third year of junior high.

129
0:4:50,95 --> 0:4:51,75
I went for about two months.

130
0:4:51,75 --> 0:4:53,29
Then I had a really bad allergic reaction.

131
0:4:53,29 --> 0:4:54,25
So I decided to take a leave from school.

132
0:4:54,25 --> 0:4:56,99
But the real reason wasn't the allergy.

133
0:4:56,99 --> 0:4:59,81
The actual reason was that I made a friend back then.

134
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:1,53
A buddy of mine and I were pretty close.

135
0:5:1,53 --> 0:5:2,59
He’s now a Taoist priest.

136
0:5:2,59 --> 0:5:5,31
Back then, we got really hooked on an online game

137
0:5:5,31 --> 0:5:6,71
called Ultima Online

138
0:5:6,71 --> 0:5:8,7
It was particularly famous

139
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:11,409
even earlier than games like Three Kingdoms or the Jin Yong Heroic Legends

140
0:5:11,409 --> 0:5:13,609
earlier than EverQuest

141
0:5:13,609 --> 0:5:17,289
even earlier than EverQuest, a graphical online game

142
0:5:17,289 --> 0:5:18,69
It was 1997 back then

143
0:5:18,69 --> 0:5:21,21
I had just gotten on the internet

144
0:5:21,21 --> 0:5:23,91
I started playing this game in 1998

145
0:5:23,91 --> 0:5:27,19
There was a server called Jeris Word in Shenzhen.

146
0:5:27,19 --> 0:5:28,29
They were all private servers.

147
0:5:28,29 --> 0:5:29,77
Back then, we used to play on these kinds of servers.

148
0:5:29,77 --> 0:5:31,689
On average, there were about two to three hundred people online.

149
0:5:31,689 --> 0:5:35,15
It was a pretty simple online game, right?

150
0:5:35,15 --> 0:5:36,75
I was really hooked back then.

151
0:5:36,75 --> 0:5:38,93
But at that time, I was still using dial-up internet.

152
0:5:38,93 --> 0:5:41,53
My mom would apply for a dedicated phone line for me every month.

153
0:5:41,53 --> 0:5:44,42
And I paid around seven to eight hundred yuan.

154
0:5:44,42 --> 0:5:46,88
The phone bill in the early 90s was around seven or eight hundred yuan.

155
0:5:46,88 --> 0:5:49,24
They encouraged me to go online.

156
0:5:49,24 --> 0:5:50,97
This was the phone bill.

157
0:5:51,21 --> 0:5:53,19
In addition to the phone bill, there was also the internet fee.

158
0:5:53,19 --> 0:5:54,47
So these were two separate expenses.

159
0:5:54,47 --> 0:5:55,73
It was really, really tough.

160
0:5:55,73 --> 0:5:57,46
But my parents were so indulgent with me.

161
0:5:57,46 --> 0:5:58,56
I had no choice.

162
0:5:58,56 --> 0:6:1,28
Actually, I did pretty well in junior high school.

163
0:6:1,28 --> 0:6:3,24
How good was I at studying in junior high?

164
0:6:3,24 --> 0:6:5,6
Not the kind that's associated with kids from Beijing, you know.

165
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:6,96
Not the kind of good that comes from low difficulty studies.

166
0:6:6,96 --> 0:6:8,88
But the kind of good that's genuinely excellent.

167
0:6:8,88 --> 0:6:10,24
Just how good was I at studying?

168
0:6:10,24 --> 0:6:13,169
Let me tell you, the test papers from Haidian District were tough.

169
0:6:13,169 --> 0:6:18,58
When I was in eighth grade, I scored full marks in four subjects.

170
0:6:18,58 --> 0:6:19,9
One subject was 99 points.

171
0:6:19,9 --> 0:6:22,38
And I can't remember what I scored in the last one.

172
0:6:22,38 --> 0:6:23,58
It's probably 94.

173
0:6:23,58 --> 0:6:27,15
Like my Chinese and English.

174
0:6:27,15 --> 0:6:28,85
Anyway, my physics and chemistry.

175
0:6:28,85 --> 0:6:30,75
Mathematics.

176
0:6:30,75 --> 0:6:33,43
English, all were full marks.

177
0:6:33,43 --> 0:6:35,75
Of course, we're talking about junior high school here.

178
0:6:35,75 --> 0:6:37,35
But senior high school is much harder.

179
0:6:37,35 --> 0:6:41,27
But if you can get full marks in every subject in junior high, you're a prodigy.

180
0:6:41,27 --> 0:6:43,71
That's how good my academic performance was.

181
0:6:43,71 --> 0:6:47,1
So later on, I kept thinking about that class in the third year of junior high.

182
0:6:47,1 --> 0:6:47,68
That teacher.

183
0:6:47,68 --> 0:6:49,2
He was quite strict, right?

184
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:50,48
The teacher was quite strict.

185
0:6:50,48 --> 0:6:52,72
He basically supervised both the morning and evening self-study sessions.

186
0:6:52,72 --> 0:6:56,24
He trained us, a group of Beijing kids, following the model of Hengshui High School.

187
0:6:56,24 --> 0:6:57,67
So, to talk about it,

188
0:6:57,67 --> 0:6:59,15
And regarding our school,

189
0:6:59,15 --> 0:6:59,89
It had an experimental class.

190
0:6:59,89 --> 0:7:2,73
But the teachers assigned to the experimental class are all excellent teachers.

191
0:7:2,73 --> 0:7:5,8
You know, our English teacher used to be...

192
0:7:5,8 --> 0:7:8,4
He would be in his late teens now.

193
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:9,52
He should be over 120 years old by now.

194
0:7:9,52 --> 0:7:11,5
Just like back then.

195
0:7:11,5 --> 0:7:13,98
He's one of those early English students educated in a church school.

196
0:7:13,98 --> 0:7:14,46
Do you know?

197
0:7:14,46 --> 0:7:17,81
Those early English students had it particularly tough.

198
0:7:17,81 --> 0:7:19,5
I think that's a point worth noting.

199
0:7:19,5 --> 0:7:19,91
The faculty at the school

200
0:7:19,91 --> 0:7:23,5
is really top-notch

201
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:26,42
but back then, all I wanted to do was play games

202
0:7:26,42 --> 0:7:30,57
because playing games online was so addictive

203
0:7:30,57 --> 0:7:31,59
I just loved playing games

204
0:7:31,59 --> 0:7:32,57
I’d grab a computer

205
0:7:32,57 --> 0:7:34,22
back then we even had Windows 98

206
0:7:34,22 --> 0:7:37,71
and with Internet Explorer 4.0, I’d go online to play games

207
0:7:37,71 --> 0:7:41,11
ah, at first, I was actually quite into Mart

208
0:7:41,11 --> 0:7:42,91
So, I used to play with that z mart

209
0:7:42,91 --> 0:7:44,8
That mart is basically a word game

210
0:7:44,8 --> 0:7:48,19
To be honest, I started playing games very early

211
0:7:48,19 --> 0:7:49,51
I really enjoyed playing games

212
0:7:49,51 --> 0:7:50,23
I was pretty much obsessed with games

213
0:7:50,23 --> 0:7:52,29
If it were other parents

214
0:7:52,29 --> 0:7:54,35
They might have sent me to Yang Yongxin

215
0:7:54,35 --> 0:7:56,549
To become one of those internet addicts

216
0:7:56,549 --> 0:7:57,149
Right?

217
0:7:57,149 --> 0:7:59,749
That, that fighting against internet addiction

218
0:7:59,749 --> 0:8:1,179
Turned me into a typical internet-addicted teenager

219
0:8:1,179 --> 0:8:2,599
But my parents didn’t

220
0:8:2,599 --> 0:8:5,119
My parents saw that I didn’t want to go to school back then

221
0:8:5,119 --> 0:8:5,739
Oh

222
0:8:5,739 --> 0:8:7,179
Playing games every day

223
0:8:7,179 --> 0:8:9,139
And not even sleeping

224
0:8:9,139 --> 0:8:10,459
Just neglecting meals and sleep to play

225
0:8:10,459 --> 0:8:11,97
They never hit me

226
0:8:11,97 --> 0:8:13,65
He didn't scold me either.

227
0:8:13,65 --> 0:8:14,73
He didn't do anything drastic.

228
0:8:14,73 --> 0:8:16,43
I just felt that not going to school...

229
0:8:16,43 --> 0:8:17,33
So, I decided not to go to school.

230
0:8:17,33 --> 0:8:17,75
Right?

231
0:8:17,75 --> 0:8:20,89
This is the age of computers now.

232
0:8:20,89 --> 0:8:22,77
I let the kid focus on playing at home.

233
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:24,86
It's fine to learn some coding too.

234
0:8:24,86 --> 0:8:26,22
So I eventually took a leave of absence.

235
0:8:26,22 --> 0:8:27,9
Yeah, I wasn’t feeling well either.

236
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:28,86
So I took a leave of absence from school.

237
0:8:28,86 --> 0:8:29,97
After taking a leave,

238
0:8:29,97 --> 0:8:31,85
to be honest, that year,

239
0:8:31,85 --> 0:8:33,89
I hung out with my buddy,

240
0:8:33,89 --> 0:8:34,17
No worries.

241
0:8:34,17 --> 0:8:34,99
We just played games,

242
0:8:34,99 --> 0:8:37,32
and gamed together using QQ,

243
0:8:37,32 --> 0:8:39,0
which is why my QQ number is pretty old.

244
0:8:39,0 --> 0:8:40,78
The seven-digit number

245
0:8:40,78 --> 0:8:43,36
So that was the year I really had a blast.

246
0:8:43,36 --> 0:8:44,8
We had a great time later on.

247
0:8:44,8 --> 0:8:45,32
After this year is over

248
0:8:45,32 --> 0:8:47,39
That game later became outdated.

249
0:8:47,39 --> 0:8:50,6
Then in the second year, I focused on my studies.

250
0:8:50,6 --> 0:8:51,5
Of course, the academic performance has declined.

251
0:8:53,5 --> 0:8:55,8
He was supposed to be able to attend Renmin University High School.

252
0:8:55,8 --> 0:8:58,8
If I keep up my grades

253
0:8:58,8 --> 0:8:59,16
I should be able to attend Renda High School

254
0:8:59,16 --> 0:9:2,28
Actually, Brother Rong could possibly get into Tsinghua University

255
0:9:2,28 --> 0:9:3,64
Haha, just joking with you guys

256
0:9:3,64 --> 0:9:4,96
If I had gone to high school at Renda

257
0:9:4,96 --> 0:9:6,62
It would have been quite possible

258
0:9:6,62 --> 0:9:8,14
At least 101 Middle School would have been a possibility

259
0:9:8,14 --> 0:9:11,22
But later, it turned out to be the level of Jiaotong or Beihang University

260
0:9:11,22 --> 0:9:14,3
So, it ended up being one of the second-tier schools in Haidian District

261
0:9:14,3 --> 0:9:17,4
Of course, my grades were pretty impressive back then.

262
0:9:17,4 --> 0:9:19,64
Even the finance school in Haidian reached out to me.

263
0:9:19,64 --> 0:9:21,92
I attended some specialized classes for math and physics.

264
0:9:21,92 --> 0:9:24,76
But I didn’t think I had the aptitude for science.

265
0:9:24,76 --> 0:9:26,36
I could still get full marks in middle school.

266
0:9:26,36 --> 0:9:27,72
But that was all over in high school.

267
0:9:27,72 --> 0:9:31,2
Because my mind was no longer on studying.

268
0:9:31,2 --> 0:9:33,14
It was all about gaming and chasing girls.

269
0:9:33,14 --> 0:9:34,43
Yeah.

270
0:9:34,43 --> 0:9:37,11
I roughly know the story about meeting that beautiful senior when I was 14.

271
0:9:37,11 --> 0:9:39,95
Even now, her beauty still outshines everyone else's.

272
0:9:39,95 --> 0:9:42,0
Pretty much, she was unbeatable.

273
0:9:42,0 --> 0:9:43,98
So, I was quite smitten.

274
0:9:43,98 --> 0:9:46,64
My heart was initially set on girls.

275
0:9:46,64 --> 0:9:48,49
But it was already focused on games.

276
0:9:48,49 --> 0:9:49,89
So, back then,

277
0:9:49,89 --> 0:9:51,97
I believed life should aim high.

278
0:9:51,97 --> 0:9:54,95
Haha, it had nothing to do with the college entrance exam.

279
0:9:54,95 --> 0:9:57,77
Of course, I ended up paying a heavy price for it later.

280
0:9:57,77 --> 0:9:58,81
I took a lot of detours.

281
0:9:58,81 --> 0:9:59,69
But it's not a big deal.

282
0:9:59,69 --> 0:10:3,99
However, I always believe that life’s circumstances and such,

283
0:10:3,99 --> 0:10:5,77
Money comes and goes, but it will come back.

284
0:10:5,77 --> 0:10:8,53
Fate ultimately has a plan for us.

285
0:10:8,53 --> 0:10:10,204
As long as we don’t break the law,

286
0:10:10,21 --> 0:10:12,31
As long as we don’t have kids too early,

287
0:10:12,31 --> 0:10:17,13
As long as we don’t do things that go against the natural order.

288
0:10:17,13 --> 0:10:18,57
Let's just speak normally here.

289
0:10:18,57 --> 0:10:19,65
Whether you're in school or not,

290
0:10:19,65 --> 0:10:20,77
or have left school,

291
0:10:20,77 --> 0:10:21,85
you can still achieve something significant,

292
0:10:21,85 --> 0:10:23,39
you can still carve out a place for yourself.

293
0:10:23,39 --> 0:10:25,33
But life doesn't work on assumptions.

294
0:10:25,33 --> 0:10:27,15
But what I want to tell you is,

295
0:10:27,15 --> 0:10:30,37
even if my grades dropped,

296
0:10:30,37 --> 0:10:31,63
I was still obsessed with games.

297
0:10:31,63 --> 0:10:32,93
Then not going to school

298
0:10:32,93 --> 0:10:35,21
Speaking of this attitude of disliking school

299
0:10:35,21 --> 0:10:38,809
I didn't feel there was anything wrong with me

300
0:10:38,809 --> 0:10:41,84
I didn't think there was any psychological issue

301
0:10:41,84 --> 0:10:42,8
He didn't hit me

302
0:10:42,8 --> 0:10:43,48
He didn't scold me

303
0:10:43,48 --> 0:10:44,98
He didn't smash my computer

304
0:10:44,98 --> 0:10:46,64
I did smash my computer in the early days

305
0:10:46,64 --> 0:10:48,75
But it was because I didn't get his call

306
0:10:48,75 --> 0:10:49,23
You know,

307
0:10:49,23 --> 0:10:50,95
because he didn't answer his call while riding the electric scooter.

308
0:10:50,95 --> 0:10:51,75
Let's not get into that.

309
0:10:51,75 --> 0:10:54,74
Another story is that my parents didn't smash my computer,

310
0:10:54,74 --> 0:10:57,7
and they kept paying the internet bills for me.

311
0:10:57,7 --> 0:10:59,3
Think about it, in the 90s,

312
0:10:59,3 --> 0:11:0,86
paying a few hundred dollars for the phone bill,

313
0:11:0,86 --> 0:11:3,21
and even getting a dedicated phone line for the internet fee,

314
0:11:3,21 --> 0:11:4,21
so I could go online.

315
0:11:4,21 --> 0:11:5,25
It was back in '97.

316
0:11:5,25 --> 0:11:6,57
You can imagine how early that was.

317
0:11:6,57 --> 0:11:7,349
Right?

318
0:11:7,349 --> 0:11:10,629
So, my mom has always been supportive of me learning computer skills,

319
0:11:10,629 --> 0:11:13,909
and studying English and getting online.

320
0:11:13,909 --> 0:11:17,65
My dad also believed these things should be left to the child's own development.

321
0:11:17,65 --> 0:11:20,77
It turns out their choices were right.

322
0:11:20,77 --> 0:11:22,93
Because I ended up excelling in these areas.

323
0:11:22,93 --> 0:11:23,81
Right?

324
0:11:23,81 --> 0:11:24,81
These are the strong points.

325
0:11:24,81 --> 0:11:25,69
However,

326
0:11:25,69 --> 0:11:27,57
if you compare yourself to the real programming geniuses,

327
0:11:27,57 --> 0:11:28,53
you can't compete.

328
0:11:28,53 --> 0:11:30,45
But I was never a genius anyway,

329
0:11:30,45 --> 0:11:32,57
so I shouldn't be trying to take the genius route, huh?

330
0:11:32,57 --> 0:11:35,9
If I had always been learning like a teacher,

331
0:11:35,9 --> 0:11:36,6
I wouldn't play games,

332
0:11:36,6 --> 0:11:37,24
I wouldn't chase girls

333
0:11:37,24 --> 0:11:38,28
Not having a girlfriend or anything like that

334
0:11:38,28 --> 0:11:39,2
Always focusing on my studies

335
0:11:39,2 --> 0:11:39,96
Always doing that sort of thing

336
0:11:39,96 --> 0:11:41,79
In the end, I got a big scholarship

337
0:11:41,79 --> 0:11:42,659
I might end up getting into Tsinghua University

338
0:11:42,659 --> 0:11:44,319
Or I might not get into Tsinghua University

339
0:11:44,319 --> 0:11:44,999
At least get into a 985 university

340
0:11:44,999 --> 0:11:45,639
At least get into a 211 university

341
0:11:45,639 --> 0:11:47,839
But I won't be happy my whole life

342
0:11:47,839 --> 0:11:49,839
I didn’t get to have fun during the time when I should have been playing.

343
0:11:49,839 --> 0:11:51,4
I wouldn’t be happy.

344
0:11:51,4 --> 0:11:51,72
You know that, right?

345
0:11:51,72 --> 0:11:52,52
So, when I talk about it,

346
0:11:52,52 --> 0:11:53,2
a lot of people say,

347
0:11:53,2 --> 0:11:53,52
Bro Rong,

348
0:11:53,52 --> 0:11:54,12
what you have,

349
0:11:54,12 --> 0:11:55,72
we really envy you.

350
0:11:55,72 --> 0:11:58,0
Or, you’re just following the Beijing kids’ playbook.

351
0:11:58,0 --> 0:11:59,52
That's right.

352
0:11:59,52 --> 0:12:0,849
However, to put it another way,

353
0:12:0,849 --> 0:12:3,89
it's not that more children in Beijing have taken advantage of

354
0:12:3,89 --> 0:12:5,29
the excellent learning environment around them.

355
0:12:5,29 --> 0:12:6,329
Did he go to a good school?

356
0:12:6,329 --> 0:12:9,26
I, on the other hand, didn't have such opportunities.

357
0:12:9,26 --> 0:12:10,1
And I didn't work hard either.

358
0:12:10,1 --> 0:12:11,7
So I don't deserve these things.

359
0:12:11,7 --> 0:12:13,76
So I don't feel bad about not attending Tsinghua University.

360
0:12:13,76 --> 0:12:15,6
It's not like the world ends if you don't go to Peking University.

361
0:12:15,6 --> 0:12:17,4
I don't think I have that talent either.

362
0:12:17,4 --> 0:12:19,63
At least, I didn't have that perseverance.

363
0:12:19,99 --> 0:12:22,97
So, as you can see, I only attended school for a month in my entire life.

364
0:12:22,97 --> 0:12:24,5
And worked for two weeks.

365
0:12:24,5 --> 0:12:25,29
So things have always been that way.

366
0:12:25,29 --> 0:12:26,91
I think human potential can be channeled into various fields.

367
0:12:26,91 --> 0:12:29,56
It doesn't have to be confined to formal education and employment.

368
0:12:29,56 --> 0:12:33,16
There are many different paths one can take.

369
0:12:33,16 --> 0:12:35,1
I can only say getting married and having kids

370
0:12:35,1 --> 0:12:36,39
then going on blind dates

371
0:12:36,39 --> 0:12:38,5
following the normal path

372
0:12:38,5 --> 0:12:39,72
he will definitely be a certain way

373
0:12:39,72 --> 0:12:41,98
if you find it suddenly interesting

374
0:12:41,98 --> 0:12:43,38
then you could take a gap year

375
0:12:43,38 --> 0:12:44,2
of course

376
0:12:44,2 --> 0:12:44,85
let me tell you

377
0:12:44,85 --> 0:12:46,33
given your family circumstances

378
0:12:46,33 --> 0:12:47,45
Maybe there are so many now

379
0:12:47,45 --> 0:12:48,89
It might seem unrealistic when you're young

380
0:12:48,89 --> 0:12:49,97
But as you grow up

381
0:12:49,97 --> 0:12:51,29
If you can do it this way

382
0:12:51,29 --> 0:12:52,71
Just do it once

383
0:12:52,71 --> 0:12:55,7
Of course, everyone's willingness to take risks varies

384
0:12:55,7 --> 0:12:56,67
But when I talk to everyone

385
0:12:56,67 --> 0:12:59,24
I mean, when you fall into a set routine

386
0:12:59,24 --> 0:13:1,44
Like my two UPloader friends

387
0:13:1,44 --> 0:13:2,61
Becoming a wife

388
0:13:2,61 --> 0:13:4,43
Becoming a mother

389
0:13:4,43 --> 0:13:8,58
Or becoming what your parents envisioned for you

390
0:13:8,58 --> 0:13:11,34
This is typically the state of most people in their twenties and thirties

391
0:13:11,34 --> 0:13:12,62
When you are in your twenties and thirties

392
0:13:12,62 --> 0:13:16,75
You are often shaped by others into a husband

393
0:13:16,75 --> 0:13:17,89
A father

394
0:13:17,89 --> 0:13:19,19
A son

395
0:13:19,19 --> 0:13:21,429
This employee, a graduate

396
0:13:21,429 --> 0:13:23,769
It means that by the time you're 40, you realize

397
0:13:23,769 --> 0:13:26,769
your life is truly starting over for the second time.

398
0:13:26,769 --> 0:13:28,24
As Jung said,

399
0:13:28,24 --> 0:13:30,88
the second beginning of life is when you start living for yourself.

400
0:13:30,88 --> 0:13:34,69
You shed the expectations others have for you,

401
0:13:34,69 --> 0:13:36,5
the roles they set for you.

402
0:13:36,5 --> 0:13:38,45
That's why I often say, social conditioning

403
0:13:38,45 --> 0:13:41,25
is like society hoping you'll be a cog in the machine,

404
0:13:41,25 --> 0:13:42,67
hoping you'll be a certain way.

405
0:13:42,67 --> 0:13:44,17
What about someone with a discerning heart?

406
0:13:44,17 --> 0:13:45,79
Of course, having a new person involved is right.

407
0:13:45,79 --> 0:13:48,29
But, the true value of your life

408
0:13:48,29 --> 0:13:49,27
Who are you really?

409
0:13:49,27 --> 0:13:51,53
This is something you need to explore.

410
0:13:51,53 --> 0:13:52,96
It's a process of exploration.

411
0:13:52,96 --> 0:13:57,44
I feel like my entire life has been about taking a break from school since my teenage years.

412
0:13:57,44 --> 0:13:59,68
During that time, I truly lived for myself.

413
0:13:59,68 --> 0:14:1,94
Because during that period, all I wanted to do was play games.

414
0:14:1,94 --> 0:14:3,5
Back then, I only wanted to have online relationships.

415
0:14:3,5 --> 0:14:4,22
I just wanted to play video games.

416
0:14:4,22 --> 0:14:6,54
At 14, I could get away with that.

417
0:14:6,54 --> 0:14:8,35
That was because I had parents who could support me.

418
0:14:8,35 --> 0:14:10,29
My parents didn’t have high expectations for my future.

419
0:14:10,29 --> 0:14:12,35
They thought if I could go to college, I would.

420
0:14:12,35 --> 0:14:13,61
If not, they were fine with that too.

421
0:14:13,61 --> 0:14:14,38
Right?

422
0:14:14,38 --> 0:14:17,24
In the end, I did take a year off during college.

423
0:14:17,24 --> 0:14:17,78
Why is that?

424
0:14:17,78 --> 0:14:19,9
Because I found the major I was studying really painful.

425
0:14:19,9 --> 0:14:21,22
And the university wasn't great either.

426
0:14:21,22 --> 0:14:22,66
Uh, cough cough

427
0:14:22,66 --> 0:14:24,74
I've always wanted to study art.

428
0:14:24,74 --> 0:14:25,74
But I didn't get to study art.

429
0:14:25,74 --> 0:14:27,29
So I felt really frustrated.

430
0:14:27,29 --> 0:14:28,23
I felt really upset.

431
0:14:28,23 --> 0:14:29,27
That's why I often skipped classes.

432
0:14:29,27 --> 0:14:29,93
He kept skipping classes

433
0:14:29,93 --> 0:14:32,72
and in the end, he went out to learn acting

434
0:14:32,72 --> 0:14:34,2
so his mindset changed

435
0:14:34,2 --> 0:14:35,12
I was determined to study film

436
0:14:35,12 --> 0:14:36,12
I had to make it happen

437
0:14:36,12 --> 0:14:37,24
and eventually, he went

438
0:14:37,24 --> 0:14:38,53
to study film

439
0:14:38,53 --> 0:14:40,73
starting from scratch to study film

440
0:14:40,73 --> 0:14:42,11
but he ultimately completed his studies

441
0:14:42,11 --> 0:14:42,97
Ultimately,

442
0:14:42,97 --> 0:14:43,91
life took some detours,

443
0:14:43,91 --> 0:14:45,9
I repeated a year in middle school,

444
0:14:45,9 --> 0:14:46,68
and I essentially repeated college,

445
0:14:46,68 --> 0:14:47,76
actually more than once,

446
0:14:47,76 --> 0:14:49,52
I went to college three times,

447
0:14:49,52 --> 0:14:50,64
across four different schools,

448
0:14:50,64 --> 0:14:51,72
but three stints in college,

449
0:14:51,72 --> 0:14:53,4
so in total,

450
0:14:53,4 --> 0:14:56,14
There’s nothing in this life worth imitating.

451
0:14:56,42 --> 0:14:59,5
But I’m very happy.

452
0:14:59,8 --> 0:15:1,56
I’m incredibly happy.

453
0:15:1,56 --> 0:15:4,64
Because I’ve never lived a day not for myself.

454
0:15:4,64 --> 0:15:6,42
When I wanted to play games,

455
0:15:6,42 --> 0:15:8,86
that game was only popular for a while.

456
0:15:8,86 --> 0:15:10,23
I played it.

457
0:15:10,47 --> 0:15:12,27
When I was in college and should have been dating,

458
0:15:12,27 --> 0:15:13,86
I did, right?

459
0:15:13,86 --> 0:15:14,78
It’s time to switch majors

460
0:15:14,78 --> 0:15:15,52
I did

461
0:15:15,52 --> 0:15:16,6
It’s time to study abroad

462
0:15:16,6 --> 0:15:17,0
I went abroad

463
0:15:17,0 --> 0:15:18,82
So there’s nothing to regret in life

464
0:15:18,82 --> 0:15:20,38
It’s not like you have to get married in your teens

465
0:15:20,38 --> 0:15:22,32
Or even go to college

466
0:15:22,32 --> 0:15:23,68
Or finish college and immediately start looking for a job

467
0:15:23,68 --> 0:15:25,72
You should go out and look for a job right after finishing university.

468
0:15:25,72 --> 0:15:26,569
It just turned out that way

469
0:15:26,569 --> 0:15:28,729
My life isn’t about what it should be

470
0:15:28,729 --> 0:15:29,769
or what others are doing

471
0:15:29,769 --> 0:15:31,229
or what everyone else is up to

472
0:15:31,229 --> 0:15:32,76
So, did it turn out that way?

473
0:15:32,76 --> 0:15:35,96
My parents have always created a laid-back lifestyle for me

474
0:15:37,4 --> 0:15:38,76
Didn’t you not want to study that in college?

475
0:15:38,76 --> 0:15:39,819
Then you can switch to something else

476
0:15:39,819 --> 0:15:41,399
And just retake the college entrance exam

477
0:15:41,399 --> 0:15:42,899
Still going out to study

478
0:15:42,899 --> 0:15:44,13
It's your choice

479
0:15:44,13 --> 0:15:45,95
I chose to study French

480
0:15:45,95 --> 0:15:47,69
Then I went abroad to start over

481
0:15:47,69 --> 0:15:49,47
Basically, I started from the first year again

482
0:15:49,47 --> 0:15:50,66
That's how it is

483
0:15:50,66 --> 0:15:52,62
So you dislike Computer Science and Technology

484
0:15:52,62 --> 0:15:53,42
There's nothing we can do about it

485
0:15:53,42 --> 0:15:53,98
Right?

486
0:15:53,98 --> 0:15:55,38
Even though you've been learning computer science since you were young

487
0:15:55,38 --> 0:15:57,2
Even though we've spent so much money on your computer education

488
0:15:57,2 --> 0:15:59,69
But you found out that you're not cut out to be a programmer

489
0:15:59,69 --> 0:16:0,849
Then you should have just given up and moved on

490
0:16:0,849 --> 0:16:2,69
Where does my interest lie?

491
0:16:2,69 --> 0:16:3,229
My interest lies in writing screenplays

492
0:16:3,229 --> 0:16:5,1
My interest is in acting

493
0:16:5,1 --> 0:16:6,35
I even got into filmmaking

494
0:16:6,35 --> 0:16:9,46
But the most interesting thing is that I ended up making films

495
0:16:9,46 --> 0:16:11,98
Acting can still bring in some money.

496
0:16:11,98 --> 0:16:14,86
But the film production hasn't been particularly smooth.

497
0:16:15,44 --> 0:16:17,64
So after many years,

498
0:16:17,64 --> 0:16:19,88
I often ended up losing a lot of money on films.

499
0:16:19,88 --> 0:16:21,64
If you add up all the film projects I've done,

500
0:16:21,64 --> 0:16:22,67
You'll see,

501
0:16:22,67 --> 0:16:24,57
I've lost over 1.3 million.

502
0:16:24,57 --> 0:16:24,99
Right?

503
0:16:24,99 --> 0:16:28,42
Isn't that about the same as what I earned as a writer?

504
0:16:28,42 --> 0:16:29,94
This time I made my first pot of gold.

505
0:16:29,94 --> 0:16:33,14
And I spent a quarter of it right away.

506
0:16:33,14 --> 0:16:34,74
Of course, when you earn your own money, you spend it yourself.

507
0:16:34,74 --> 0:16:35,74
That's quite normal.

508
0:16:35,74 --> 0:16:39,9
But we all know that life has a margin for error.

509
0:16:39,9 --> 0:16:41,7
You won't learn without hitting a few walls.

510
0:16:41,7 --> 0:16:43,3
You won't figure it out without taking a few gap years.

511
0:16:43,3 --> 0:16:45,58
You won't find what you truly want to do.

512
0:16:45,58 --> 0:16:47,51
You won't know what you're passionate about.

513
0:16:47,51 --> 0:16:49,83
I later realized that my production skills were lacking.

514
0:16:49,83 --> 0:16:51,39
My ability to shoot videos was quite poor.

515
0:16:51,39 --> 0:16:52,87
This was because my spatial imagination wasn't strong enough.

516
0:16:52,87 --> 0:16:54,16
My art foundation was also weak.

517
0:16:54,16 --> 0:16:56,8
But when it comes to understanding interpersonal dynamics,

518
0:16:56,8 --> 0:16:57,84
I have a better grasp of those aspects.

519
0:16:57,84 --> 0:17:0,15
So, my acting skills are relatively better.

520
0:17:0,15 --> 0:17:1,67
However, in terms of this aspect,

521
0:17:1,67 --> 0:17:2,91
it ultimately depends on what you're meant to do.

522
0:17:2,91 --> 0:17:4,3
what you'll ultimately be able to do

523
0:17:4,3 --> 0:17:6,15
what you'll ultimately contribute to society

524
0:17:6,15 --> 0:17:7,74
is something you can't predict

525
0:17:7,74 --> 0:17:10,26
I was in my thirties and still didn't know

526
0:17:10,26 --> 0:17:13,34
so in the early stages, I seemed a bit aimless

527
0:17:13,34 --> 0:17:14,42
you're already this old

528
0:17:14,42 --> 0:17:16,66
how come you still haven't figured out what you want to do

529
0:17:16,66 --> 0:17:18,82
spending your days fiddling with this and that

530
0:17:18,82 --> 0:17:20,29
how can that be okay

531
0:17:20,29 --> 0:17:21,81
The most important reason is this.

532
0:17:21,81 --> 0:17:23,41
A doting mother often spoils her child.

533
0:17:23,41 --> 0:17:25,7
But from this perspective,

534
0:17:25,7 --> 0:17:27,17
if you analyze it from the viewpoint of a normal person,

535
0:17:27,17 --> 0:17:28,94
my parents,

536
0:17:28,94 --> 0:17:29,7
having a son like me,

537
0:17:29,7 --> 0:17:30,58
consider themselves quite unlucky.

538
0:17:30,58 --> 0:17:31,74
However, in reality,

539
0:17:31,74 --> 0:17:34,38
my parents have never thought much of me.

540
0:17:34,38 --> 0:17:37,34
Because from their perspective, I'm not an unsuccessful son

541
0:17:37,34 --> 0:17:39,78
I'm exploring my own path

542
0:17:39,78 --> 0:17:42,55
I'm taking a different route from others

543
0:17:42,55 --> 0:17:45,35
And this path might take a bit longer

544
0:17:45,35 --> 0:17:47,87
Even if you study until you're in your late twenties

545
0:17:47,87 --> 0:17:49,41
We support you

546
0:17:49,41 --> 0:17:50,43
You can study as long as you want

547
0:17:50,43 --> 0:17:52,73
As long as there's food on the table at home

548
0:17:52,73 --> 0:17:54,17
As long as there's something to eat at home

549
0:17:54,17 --> 0:17:56,41
As long as I don’t starve, nothing else really matters, right?

550
0:17:56,41 --> 0:17:57,73
Even if my parents are gone, I still need a place to live.

551
0:17:57,73 --> 0:17:59,25
When it comes to these things,

552
0:17:59,25 --> 0:18:1,5
My parents have always been there to support me.

553
0:18:1,5 --> 0:18:3,17
So the ultimate point I’m trying to make is,

554
0:18:3,17 --> 0:18:5,82
The goal of today’s episode isn’t to brag to you all.

555
0:18:5,82 --> 0:18:7,52
What kind of life do you want to lead?

556
0:18:7,52 --> 0:18:9,84
How tough is your life right now?

557
0:18:9,84 --> 0:18:10,34
What’s the plan?

558
0:18:10,34 --> 0:18:11,6
You can't compare with me

559
0:18:11,6 --> 0:18:11,66
That's not the case

560
0:18:11,66 --> 0:18:15,59
I'm just saying, if you manage to stay in Beijing or Shanghai through hard work

561
0:18:15,59 --> 0:18:17,13
then you're a medical representative

562
0:18:17,13 --> 0:18:18,41
you've made money

563
0:18:18,41 --> 0:18:19,13
what will the future be like

564
0:18:19,13 --> 0:18:20,97
if you can provide a great environment for your child

565
0:18:20,97 --> 0:18:23,84
I suggest that your child is worth raising

566
0:18:23,84 --> 0:18:26,54
you should follow the method they prefer

567
0:18:26,54 --> 0:18:27,7
Let him live his life.

568
0:18:27,7 --> 0:18:29,7
Free-range parenting might actually be better.

569
0:18:29,7 --> 0:18:32,42
Or if your child's personality is similar to mine,

570
0:18:32,42 --> 0:18:34,5
raising them this way will definitely be fine.

571
0:18:34,5 --> 0:18:35,38
Because a prodigal's return is invaluable.

572
0:18:35,38 --> 0:18:36,18
In the end, he will find his place.

573
0:18:36,18 --> 0:18:38,35
All the hardships he endures will eventually pay off.

574
0:18:38,35 --> 0:18:41,91
The detours he takes will ultimately lead him to where he needs to be.

575
0:18:41,91 --> 0:18:43,87
Those winding paths he walks

576
0:18:43,87 --> 0:18:45,889
What seemed like a detour at the time

577
0:18:45,889 --> 0:18:47,489
What seemed like a detour in society

578
0:18:47,489 --> 0:18:48,249
What seemed like neglecting one's duties

579
0:18:48,249 --> 0:18:51,11
But in life, there's nothing that shouldn't be explored

580
0:18:51,11 --> 0:18:53,7
Can you say that what you explored was wrong?

581
0:18:53,7 --> 0:18:55,54
So what was your purpose in playing The Elder Scrolls?

582
0:18:55,54 --> 0:18:58,74
You went straight to every quest marker

583
0:18:58,74 --> 0:19:0,22
Then you finished the main storyline and that was it?

584
0:19:0,22 --> 0:19:3,16
No, you had to explore every cave

585
0:19:3,16 --> 0:19:4,64
Every skill has been explored.

586
0:19:4,64 --> 0:19:7,8
Every place has been thoroughly scavenged.

587
0:19:7,8 --> 0:19:10,24
This is what makes life enjoyable.

588
0:19:10,24 --> 0:19:12,2
You've taken down all five guilds.

589
0:19:12,2 --> 0:19:13,68
You've defeated the Dark Brotherhood.

590
0:19:13,68 --> 0:19:15,16
You've taken out the Fighters Guild.

591
0:19:15,16 --> 0:19:16,8
The Mages Guild has been defeated.

592
0:19:16,8 --> 0:19:17,73
The Thieves Guild has been taken care of, right?

593
0:19:17,73 --> 0:19:18,97
Then you've taken down the Blades.

594
0:19:18,97 --> 0:19:19,81
There's a lot of stuff

595
0:19:19,81 --> 0:19:21,41
The vampire hunter is playing this game again

596
0:19:21,41 --> 0:19:23,329
You're playing Tremble Isle again

597
0:19:23,329 --> 0:19:24,209
You're replaying Nine Knights

598
0:19:24,209 --> 0:19:26,169
You haven't really replayed this game

599
0:19:26,169 --> 0:19:28,329
I've been playing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered recently

600
0:19:28,329 --> 0:19:29,82
That's the game

601
0:19:29,82 --> 0:19:31,3
If you don't do the side quests

602
0:19:31,3 --> 0:19:32,38
If you don't collect them

603
0:19:32,38 --> 0:19:34,16
Then what's the point of life?

604
0:19:34,16 --> 0:19:35,18
Just completing the main storyline?

605
0:19:35,18 --> 0:19:36,8
Just watching an animation and that's it?

606
0:19:36,8 --> 0:19:37,52
Right?

607
0:19:37,52 --> 0:19:38,6
That would be pretty boring.

608
0:19:38,6 --> 0:19:40,5
You need to immerse yourself in the story.

609
0:19:40,5 --> 0:19:43,24
A plot filled with twists and turns is what makes it interesting.

610
0:19:43,24 --> 0:19:46,52
So you should definitely take a gap year for yourself.

611
0:19:46,52 --> 0:19:49,0
No matter what, give your child their own space.

612
0:19:49,0 --> 0:19:50,26
He's not doing well in his studies now.

613
0:19:50,26 --> 0:19:52,48
Before he was 12, he might not have been good at English.

614
0:19:52,48 --> 0:19:53,84
He just couldn't get it.

615
0:19:53,84 --> 0:19:56,22
Parents should allow their children's grades to drop.

616
0:19:56,22 --> 0:19:57,72
They should allow him to take a break from school.

617
0:19:57,72 --> 0:20:1,8
They should allow him to pursue something he loves.

618
0:20:1,8 --> 0:20:3,56
Even if it's a person or a celebrity.

619
0:20:3,56 --> 0:20:4,58
Or something he's passionate about.

620
0:20:4,58 --> 0:20:6,18
In the end, it will fade away.

621
0:20:6,18 --> 0:20:7,2
It will fade away

622
0:20:7,2 --> 0:20:9,4
But at the age when I was being dramatic

623
0:20:9,4 --> 0:20:10,28
My parents gave me this opportunity

624
0:20:10,28 --> 0:20:11,24
To put my studies on hold

625
0:20:11,24 --> 0:20:13,35
And pursue what I truly love

626
0:20:13,35 --> 0:20:14,71
What a wonderful thing

627
0:20:14,71 --> 0:20:16,1
This is also a kind of luck

628
0:20:16,1 --> 0:20:17,23
In the eyes of others

629
0:20:17,23 --> 0:20:19,18
Oh, you didn't get into the Adult Attached High School

630
0:20:19,18 --> 0:20:20,32
How pitiful

631
0:20:20,32 --> 0:20:23,82
Maybe I was never meant for Renda High School

632
0:20:24,14 --> 0:20:25,7
Even if I could get in

633
0:20:25,7 --> 0:20:26,54
Even if I got into Tsinghua or Peking University

634
0:20:26,54 --> 0:20:27,6
Would I be happy?

635
0:20:27,6 --> 0:20:29,46
I would find out that among these geniuses

636
0:20:29,46 --> 0:20:31,49
I am just an ordinary person

637
0:20:31,49 --> 0:20:32,45
No matter how hard I try

638
0:20:32,45 --> 0:20:34,7
I can't match those with natural talent

639
0:20:34,7 --> 0:20:35,45
Or those who work hard

640
0:20:35,45 --> 0:20:37,73
They can work ten or a hundred times harder than I do

641
0:20:37,73 --> 0:20:39,52
So places like that aren't meant for me

642
0:20:39,52 --> 0:20:40,52
I've been to Peking University

643
0:20:40,52 --> 0:20:41,18
I've been to Tsinghua University

644
0:20:41,18 --> 0:20:42,14
I've seen my classmates

645
0:20:42,14 --> 0:20:44,8
I've seen my classmates who got into Peking and Tsinghua

646
0:20:44,8 --> 0:20:46,6
Some of my Peking and Tsinghua classmates stayed on as faculty

647
0:20:46,6 --> 0:20:47,58
Some are classmates from Beijing

648
0:20:47,58 --> 0:20:48,1
That's right

649
0:20:48,1 --> 0:20:49,1
staying at Peking and Tsinghua Universities

650
0:20:49,1 --> 0:20:50,54
they have always been exceptional learners

651
0:20:50,54 --> 0:20:52,6
far more talented than I am

652
0:20:52,6 --> 0:20:54,22
they belong there

653
0:20:54,22 --> 0:20:55,76
they should become doctors

654
0:20:55,76 --> 0:20:57,53
they should become engineers

655
0:20:57,53 --> 0:20:59,13
they have such a reputation

656
0:20:59,13 --> 0:20:59,89
they have such qualities

657
0:20:59,89 --> 0:21:1,15
My cousin is also at Tsinghua.

658
0:21:1,15 --> 0:21:1,57
Right?

659
0:21:1,57 --> 0:21:3,5
He's a local candidate.

660
0:21:3,5 --> 0:21:4,85
And I have another cousin at Tsinghua.

661
0:21:4,85 --> 0:21:6,7
He's a candidate from Beijing.

662
0:21:6,7 --> 0:21:6,75
It's like that.

663
0:21:6,75 --> 0:21:9,139
So, quite a few people in our family have attended Tsinghua.

664
0:21:9,139 --> 0:21:12,559
But let me tell you, I'm not saying I have to go there.

665
0:21:12,559 --> 0:21:14,459
Nor am I saying I excelled in middle school.

666
0:21:14,459 --> 0:21:15,85
It’s not that you must study well in high school

667
0:21:15,85 --> 0:21:17,41
but rather that you have such an opportunity

668
0:21:17,41 --> 0:21:18,89
it may not truly be suitable for you

669
0:21:18,89 --> 0:21:21,49
so you need to explore your own path in life

670
0:21:21,49 --> 0:21:23,69
If my parents think that only attending Tsinghua University

671
0:21:23,69 --> 0:21:25,5
or Peking University counts as education

672
0:21:25,5 --> 0:21:27,13
or if they see that I have such talent

673
0:21:27,13 --> 0:21:28,17
they would push me to study

674
0:21:28,17 --> 0:21:30,45
how miserable my life would be

675
0:21:30,93 --> 0:21:32,45
It might still be the case now.

676
0:21:32,45 --> 0:21:32,77
Right?

677
0:21:32,77 --> 0:21:33,93
Or maybe they've already jumped off a building.

678
0:21:33,93 --> 0:21:35,11
There could be all sorts of outcomes.

679
0:21:35,11 --> 0:21:37,19
Because the competition is going to get fiercer.

680
0:21:37,19 --> 0:21:38,47
You started in middle school,

681
0:21:38,47 --> 0:21:39,39
then high school,

682
0:21:39,39 --> 0:21:40,27
then college,

683
0:21:40,27 --> 0:21:44,13
and then grad school, where you still have to compete in the job market.

684
0:21:44,13 --> 0:21:46,29
Is competition among Chinese people lacking?

685
0:21:46,29 --> 0:21:48,3
Is the effort of Chinese people insignificant?

686
0:21:48,3 --> 0:21:50,22
Chinese people have always been accustomed to enduring such hardships.

687
0:21:50,22 --> 0:21:52,5
So from the very beginning, don’t hold back on your efforts.

688
0:21:52,5 --> 0:21:54,62
From the very beginning, don’t embrace UG ideology.

689
0:21:54,62 --> 0:21:56,5
From the very beginning, don’t fall into the theater effect.

690
0:21:56,5 --> 0:21:59,15
From the very beginning, don’t get caught up in the rat race with others.

691
0:21:59,15 --> 0:22:0,43
Although I’m also in a competitive space with my videos now,

692
0:22:0,43 --> 0:22:1,71
I find my competition very fulfilling.

693
0:22:1,71 --> 0:22:3,8
Because I don’t find it difficult to roll this up

694
0:22:3,8 --> 0:22:5,28
But most importantly

695
0:22:5,28 --> 0:22:8,2
it’s about giving people a space for emotional release

696
0:22:8,2 --> 0:22:10,8
whether they have the chance to do what they love

697
0:22:10,8 --> 0:22:11,2
create videos

698
0:22:11,2 --> 0:22:13,92
This is the best job I’ve had in my life

699
0:22:13,92 --> 0:22:15,51
the happiest job

700
0:22:15,51 --> 0:22:17,63
it helps me deal with my own psychological issues

701
0:22:17,63 --> 0:22:19,5
and allows me to connect with everyone

702
0:22:19,5 --> 0:22:20,67
And at the same time, I can earn money.

703
0:22:20,67 --> 0:22:21,91
The hundreds of episodes I've done.

704
0:22:21,91 --> 0:22:25,215
Not a single one was made because someone forced me to.

705
0:22:25,27 --> 0:22:27,69
Sometimes, I do feel really exhausted when making them.

706
0:22:27,69 --> 0:22:29,35
Like today, I've been panting all day.

707
0:22:29,35 --> 0:22:30,19
Today has been really tiring.

708
0:22:30,19 --> 0:22:33,0
I just drank that yogurt that makes you need to go to the bathroom.

709
0:22:33,0 --> 0:22:35,48
So now my stomach is rumbling like thunder.

710
0:22:35,48 --> 0:22:36,34
It's quite amusing.

711
0:22:36,34 --> 0:22:40,1
But it doesn’t make me feel particularly drained.

712
0:22:40,1 --> 0:22:41,22
I don’t have that feeling.

713
0:22:41,22 --> 0:22:44,269
It makes me feel joyful when I speak and do things.

714
0:22:44,269 --> 0:22:46,28
This is the kind of feeling I need.

715
0:22:46,28 --> 0:22:49,76
So, right now, I’m in the best state of my life.

716
0:22:49,76 --> 0:22:50,84
Why would I complain?

717
0:22:50,84 --> 0:22:51,96
I’m not going to work anyway.

718
0:22:51,96 --> 0:22:52,98
Nothing much will change.

719
0:22:52,98 --> 0:22:56,92
So now, it has actually led me to the profession that suits me best.

720
0:22:56,92 --> 0:22:59,4
But can I do without something in my major?

721
0:22:59,4 --> 0:23:1,28
Could I not have studied computer science back then?

722
0:23:1,28 --> 0:23:2,48
Could I have skipped English?

723
0:23:3,48 --> 0:23:4,88
Could I have avoided studying directing and acting?

724
0:23:4,88 --> 0:23:6,8
Could I have bypassed sociology?

725
0:23:6,8 --> 0:23:9,79
Not learning them would have prevented me from becoming who I am today.

726
0:23:9,79 --> 0:23:11,56
So I chose this path from the start.

727
0:23:11,56 --> 0:23:14,2
It's the culmination of all my decisions.

728
0:23:14,2 --> 0:23:16,62
Missing even a single day or a single detour would have been wrong.

729
0:23:16,62 --> 0:23:19,19
So these things are truly what have shaped me

730
0:23:19,19 --> 0:23:21,51
So your life actually doesn't take wrong turns

731
0:23:21,51 --> 0:23:22,83
Any detour is the toughest part

732
0:23:22,83 --> 0:23:25,35
Every climate will ultimately lead to a final outcome

733
0:23:25,35 --> 0:23:26,95
It's like playing The Elder Scrolls

734
0:23:26,95 --> 0:23:27,95
You take a detour

735
0:23:27,95 --> 0:23:30,19
And find a place that's unexpectedly beautiful

736
0:23:30,19 --> 0:23:31,63
Collect a legendary weapon

737
0:23:31,63 --> 0:23:34,7
And it might make the rest of your life easier

738
0:23:34,7 --> 0:23:36,69
You might earn a fortune when you're 30.

739
0:23:36,69 --> 0:23:38,19
Life becomes simpler at 40.

740
0:23:38,19 --> 0:23:40,26
You might strike it rich at 40.

741
0:23:40,26 --> 0:23:42,34
And later, you might find a wonderful wife.

742
0:23:42,34 --> 0:23:43,3
That's how it goes.

743
0:23:43,3 --> 0:23:46,949
So how can you easily judge a person's gains and losses?

744
0:23:46,949 --> 0:23:48,789
Don't use your small brain to think about life.

745
0:23:48,789 --> 0:23:50,449
Be an enlightened parent.

746
0:23:50,449 --> 0:23:51,849
No matter what,

747
0:23:51,849 --> 0:23:52,669
You should know that the future is unpredictable.

748
0:23:52,669 --> 0:23:55,29
You don't even know when they will live or die.

749
0:23:55,29 --> 0:23:57,1
Why worry about the future?

750
0:23:57,1 --> 0:23:58,9
If my parents hadn't been so open-minded back then,

751
0:23:58,9 --> 0:24:0,4
They could have cut off my internet fees,

752
0:24:0,4 --> 0:24:3,34
Smashed my computer,

753
0:24:3,34 --> 0:24:4,5
Or even broken my legs.

754
0:24:4,5 --> 0:24:5,62
But they didn't choose any of those options.

755
0:24:5,62 --> 0:24:7,5
They continued paying for my internet,

756
0:24:7,5 --> 0:24:10,6
Continued upgrading my computer,

757
0:24:10,31 --> 0:24:12,7
And I went to school as usual.

758
0:24:12,7 --> 0:24:13,99
They acted like nothing was wrong.

759
0:24:13,99 --> 0:24:15,99
My dad went to work as usual,

760
0:24:15,99 --> 0:24:17,75
And so did my mom.

761
0:24:17,75 --> 0:24:19,5
There was no resistance,

762
0:24:19,5 --> 0:24:20,35
No interference.

763
0:24:20,35 --> 0:24:21,85
My grandparents were also around at the time,

764
0:24:21,85 --> 0:24:23,75
And they didn't think there was anything wrong with me staying at home.

765
0:24:23,75 --> 0:24:25,47
They just thought it was nice to see their grandson every day.

766
0:24:25,47 --> 0:24:28,54
Growing up in such a family environment,

767
0:24:28,54 --> 0:24:29,3
How could I not feel like I was chosen by destiny?

768
0:24:29,3 --> 0:24:31,16
Right?

769
0:24:31,16 --> 0:24:34,34
How could I not feel happy about my life?

770
0:24:34,34 --> 0:24:37,4
How could I not feel blessed?

771
0:24:37,4 --> 0:24:38,1
Maybe not before,

772
0:24:38,1 --> 0:24:40,18
But after comparing my life with many others,

773
0:24:40,18 --> 0:24:43,33
My life has definitely been on a roll.

774
0:24:43,33 --> 0:24:44,85
I'm 41 now,

775
0:24:44,85 --> 0:24:47,85
And I haven't had a single serious injury or fracture.

776
0:24:47,85 --> 0:24:49,65
When I go out to play,

777
0:24:49,65 --> 0:24:51,27
Others get into car accidents and end up with blood all over their faces,

778
0:24:51,27 --> 0:24:54,35
But I haven't even scratched a hair on my head.

779
0:24:54,35 --> 0:24:56,3
What else could this be if not being chosen by destiny?

780
0:24:56,3 --> 0:24:57,59
So this is a warning from heaven,

781
0:24:57,59 --> 0:24:58,79
Telling you not to do anything too bad in this life,

782
0:24:58,79 --> 0:25:0,64
Or else heaven won't bless you.

783
0:25:0,64 --> 0:25:1,0
That's how it is.

784
0:25:1,0 --> 0:25:2,72
Moreover,

785
0:25:2,72 --> 0:25:5,8
You should believe that you are destined for greatness.

786
0:25:5,8 --> 0:25:8,389
You can achieve great things in this life.

787
0:25:8,389 --> 0:25:10,169
So the source of great achievements isn't from setting grand goals,

788
0:25:10,169 --> 0:25:10,909
But from realizing that your life has been quite ordinary after the fact,

789
0:25:10,909 --> 0:25:11,669
And feeling disappointed about it.

790
0:25:11,669 --> 0:25:13,249
That's the journey of an idealist from hope to disappointment.

791
0:25:13,249 --> 0:25:15,78
But if you're not like that,

792
0:25:15,78 --> 0:25:18,2
If you're more like me,

793
0:25:18,2 --> 0:25:20,6
I wanted to play games in junior high,

794
0:25:22,2 --> 0:25:24,54
Chase girls in college,

795
0:25:24,54 --> 0:25:26,47
Change majors in my senior year,

796
0:25:26,47 --> 0:25:27,99
And go abroad.

797
0:25:27,99 --> 0:25:30,98
Of course, I left in my junior year.

798
0:25:30,98 --> 0:25:32,74
So what if life fails?

799
0:25:32,74 --> 0:25:34,38
If you fail, just start over.

800
0:25:34,38 --> 0:25:36,12
Right?

801
0:25:36,12 --> 0:25:38,38
But when I start over, I start from the same place.

802
0:25:38,66 --> 0:25:40,5
I'm not starting a new life somewhere else,

803
0:25:40,5 --> 0:25:42,6
I'm restarting right here.

804
0:25:42,6 --> 0:25:43,73
Let's try again, shall we?

805
0:25:43,73 --> 0:25:45,63
If you fail in junior high,

806
0:25:45,63 --> 0:25:47,85
Let's try again.

807
0:25:47,85 --> 0:25:49,29
If that doesn't work,

808
0:25:49,29 --> 0:25:49,97
What if you graduate from junior high?

809
0:25:49,97 --> 0:25:51,99
You can always learn to perform crosstalk.

810
0:25:51,99 --> 0:25:53,95
Right?

811
0:25:53,95 --> 0:25:55,27
So the path of life is such that,

812
0:25:55,27 --> 0:25:56,23
When you truly hit rock bottom,

813
0:25:56,23 --> 0:25:56,67
A new opportunity appears.

814
0:25:56,67 --> 0:25:57,27
So never say you're nothing.

815
0:25:57,27 --> 0:25:58,19
Always repeat this phrase:

816
0:25:58,19 --> 0:25:58,99
If it really doesn't work

817
0:25:58,99 --> 0:26:0,3
So what if I graduated from junior high?

818
0:26:0,3 --> 0:26:1,33
We could also learn to perform crosstalk.

819
0:26:1,33 --> 0:26:2,8
Is that right?

820
0:26:2,8 --> 0:26:3,58
So, the journey of life,

821
0:26:3,58 --> 0:26:5,48
When you really do cut it off

822
0:26:5,48 --> 0:26:7,56
A new turning point has emerged.

823
0:26:7,56 --> 0:26:10,69
So never say you're not something.

824
0:26:10,69 --> 0:26:12,59
Always remember to repeat this phrase

825
0:26:12,59 --> 0:26:13,98
I am the chosen one
