1
0:0:1,1 --> 0:0:2,92
Let's chat for the 523rd episode.

2
0:0:2,92 --> 0:0:5,869
I didn't expect it to happen so quickly.

3
0:0:5,869 --> 0:0:9,649
But the times are changing faster than we can keep up.

4
0:0:9,649 --> 0:0:11,989
The changes are happening too fast.

5
0:0:11,989 --> 0:0:13,719
We'll definitely talk about the trade war.

6
0:0:13,719 --> 0:0:15,879
But my introduction is about

7
0:0:15,879 --> 0:0:20,759
You shouldn't give these NPD narcissists too much room to grow.

8
0:0:20,759 --> 0:0:22,639
Because of NBT,

9
0:0:22,639 --> 0:0:24,239
NPD narcissists.

10
0:0:24,239 --> 0:0:25,279
These narcissists

11
0:0:25,279 --> 0:0:29,84
Their world outlook is detached from reality.

12
0:0:29,84 --> 0:0:31,72
He's won so many times now

13
0:0:31,72 --> 0:0:32,96
Do you know who I'm talking about

14
0:0:32,96 --> 0:0:34,8
Winning so many times is quite alarming

15
0:0:34,8 --> 0:0:38,56
Especially when you put a few narcissists together

16
0:0:38,56 --> 0:0:39,94
And they corroborate each other

17
0:0:39,94 --> 0:0:41,48
They flatter and praise each other

18
0:0:41,48 --> 0:0:42,32
They chat and gossip

19
0:0:42,32 --> 0:0:45,1
This thing is extremely dangerous.

20
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:46,17
We already have the Sleeping Dragon.

21
0:0:46,17 --> 0:0:46,93
And now, the Phoenix too.

22
0:0:46,93 --> 0:0:50,72
This is truly terrifying.

23
0:0:50,72 --> 0:0:55,19
Well, I actually didn't want to talk about the trade war issue.

24
0:0:55,19 --> 0:0:57,71
Because I generally don't like to comment on this.

25
0:0:57,71 --> 0:0:58,79
International current affairs and politics.

26
0:0:58,79 --> 0:1:0,39
Because it's so easy to get into arguments over this.

27
0:1:0,39 --> 0:1:2,73
I'm willing to focus on personal growth.

28
0:1:2,73 --> 0:1:6,17
But this time, I've been pushed to speak up.

29
0:1:6,17 --> 0:1:7,65
Because from a personal growth perspective,

30
0:1:7,65 --> 0:1:8,53
I'm actually willing to share.

31
0:1:8,53 --> 0:1:12,68
Narcissistic Personality Types (NPT) are people you shouldn't work with.

32
0:1:12,68 --> 0:1:14,96
These people often achieve great success in their careers,

33
0:1:14,96 --> 0:1:18,57
but the main reason for their success is their capable employees.

34
0:1:18,57 --> 0:1:21,51
As long as you choose the right strategy,

35
0:1:21,51 --> 0:1:23,21
even if you're sitting on assets,

36
0:1:23,21 --> 0:1:24,97
it's hard to fail.

37
0:1:24,97 --> 0:1:26,13
But let's be real

38
0:1:26,13 --> 0:1:30,68
Sometimes being out of touch with reality can be quite problematic

39
0:1:30,68 --> 0:1:33,56
Musk's father actually has NPD

40
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:35,68
He has some of those traits as well

41
0:1:35,68 --> 0:1:39,289
But Musk himself is still grounded in reality

42
0:1:39,289 --> 0:1:40,609
He's not a complete narcissist

43
0:1:40,609 --> 0:1:44,609
But he does have some NPD tendencies, being rather decisive

44
0:1:44,609 --> 0:1:45,789
How should I put it

45
0:1:45,789 --> 0:1:48,229
He believes his judgment is correct

46
0:1:48,229 --> 0:1:49,589
Dong Mingzhu is also that kind of person.

47
0:1:49,589 --> 0:1:52,7
I’m not afraid of her suing me; I don’t care.

48
0:1:52,7 --> 0:1:54,3
She’s also a major narcissist.

49
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:56,92
Putting her own statue in the phone, you know.

50
0:1:56,92 --> 0:1:57,54
Right?

51
0:1:57,54 --> 0:2:0,2
She doesn’t really care about the ultimate development of the company.

52
0:2:0,2 --> 0:2:3,4
Although she wants to improve the company’s performance,

53
0:2:3,4 --> 0:2:5,8
her autocratic style,

54
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:7,65
her Empress Dowager-style control methods.

55
0:2:7,65 --> 0:2:10,73
To be honest, it's harmful to the group.

56
0:2:10,73 --> 0:2:12,22
It's harmful to this thing.

57
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:13,6
Let's put Musk aside for now.

58
0:2:13,6 --> 0:2:16,88
He's already considered a fairly successful investor.

59
0:2:16,88 --> 0:2:19,5
And a businessman who has done well in his career.

60
0:2:19,5 --> 0:2:21,5
But Trump, you can't do that.

61
0:2:21,5 --> 0:2:22,82
Who is NAVARRO anyway?

62
0:2:22,82 --> 0:2:24,4
NAVO writes his own books.

63
0:2:24,4 --> 0:2:26,76
And even fabricated a name.

64
0:2:26,76 --> 0:2:29,41
Then he uses his own work to cite himself.

65
0:2:29,41 --> 0:2:31,31
He’s an academic fraud.

66
0:2:31,31 --> 0:2:32,57
If you use his theories,

67
0:2:32,57 --> 0:2:34,21
his tariff theory,

68
0:2:34,21 --> 0:2:36,71
you might think it’s quite straightforward.

69
0:2:36,71 --> 0:2:40,92
I used to like Trump, though.

70
0:2:40,92 --> 0:2:42,8
Why do you like him?

71
0:2:42,8 --> 0:2:44,11
Because he’s pretty entertaining.

72
0:2:44,11 --> 0:2:44,43
You know.

73
0:2:44,43 --> 0:2:45,43
It's rather simplistic

74
0:2:45,43 --> 0:2:46,55
It's a bit more straightforward

75
0:2:46,55 --> 0:2:49,55
I've read his books on economics, so I know his understanding

76
0:2:49,55 --> 0:2:53,43
To be frank, his grasp of economics

77
0:2:53,43 --> 0:2:54,51
might not even be as good as mine

78
0:2:54,51 --> 0:2:56,87
I've always been hesitant to comment on economic matters

79
0:2:56,87 --> 0:3:0,74
because there are plenty of experts on Bilibili in the field of economics

80
0:3:0,74 --> 0:3:2,34
I focus more on humanities and social sciences

81
0:3:2,34 --> 0:3:4,71
so I'll analyze from the perspective of history, geography, and politics

82
0:3:4,71 --> 0:3:6,77
Of course, there have been big names in history

83
0:3:6,77 --> 0:3:7,71
in politics as well

84
0:3:7,71 --> 0:3:8,95
and in international relations

85
0:3:8,95 --> 0:3:9,79
so let's talk about it

86
0:3:9,79 --> 0:3:11,7
we won't argue with others about it

87
0:3:11,7 --> 0:3:12,62
these things are Trump's

88
0:3:12,62 --> 0:3:14,82
if he thinks tariffs are

89
0:3:14,82 --> 0:3:17,91
that simple a logic

90
0:3:17,91 --> 0:3:19,31
then he raised the tariffs

91
0:3:19,31 --> 0:3:21,51
The other side would be forced to come back

92
0:3:21,51 --> 0:3:22,59
Manufacturing would flow back

93
0:3:22,59 --> 0:3:23,75
That would be too simplistic

94
0:3:23,75 --> 0:3:25,72
He didn't thoroughly study business

95
0:3:25,72 --> 0:3:27,28
What is this thing?

96
0:3:27,28 --> 0:3:29,189
How can I put it?

97
0:3:29,189 --> 0:3:31,509
Let's say we're talking about a conflict

98
0:3:31,509 --> 0:3:32,229
To win

99
0:3:32,229 --> 0:3:34,509
Strategies, tactics, and combat must be considered

100
0:3:34,509 --> 0:3:35,769
That is, the strategy

101
0:3:35,769 --> 0:3:38,149
Now, strategy and tactics

102
0:3:38,149 --> 0:3:39,249
and battles

103
0:3:39,249 --> 0:3:41,96
you have to win all these campaigns

104
0:3:41,96 --> 0:3:43,88
you've been winning for so long

105
0:3:43,88 --> 0:3:47,0
just having an 800,000 to 600,000 advantage isn't enough, right?

106
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:48,459
you're not a micro-management expert

107
0:3:48,459 --> 0:3:50,139
a lot at the micro level

108
0:3:50,139 --> 0:3:52,419
in real economic terms

109
0:3:52,419 --> 0:3:54,179
When it plays a certain role

110
0:3:54,179 --> 0:3:55,54
He is unaware of it

111
0:3:55,54 --> 0:3:56,54
He is unaware of it

112
0:3:56,54 --> 0:3:59,7
First, let's talk about big business versus small business

113
0:3:59,7 --> 0:4:1,91
Their logic is different

114
0:4:2,31 --> 0:4:5,11
Where large enterprises truly have an impact

115
0:4:5,11 --> 0:4:6,91
The tariff has been raised to 104

116
0:4:6,91 --> 0:4:7,83
Ours is 34

117
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:10,91
Let's first discuss where his policies have an impact

118
0:4:10,91 --> 0:4:12,11
When it comes to his stuff

119
0:4:12,11 --> 0:4:13,92
he adds everything together

120
0:4:13,92 --> 0:4:16,8
we only have some specific things at home

121
0:4:16,8 --> 0:4:17,68
so on our side

122
0:4:17,68 --> 0:4:21,29
the central bank's thinking is very clear

123
0:4:21,29 --> 0:4:23,349
we at least won't let a bunch of fools

124
0:4:23,349 --> 0:4:24,709
control everything

125
0:4:24,709 --> 0:4:26,429
you know what he adds

126
0:4:26,429 --> 0:4:30,23
it actually impacts American businesses, big and small

127
0:4:30,23 --> 0:4:31,63
For large corporations,

128
0:4:31,63 --> 0:4:33,23
because their production components,

129
0:4:33,23 --> 0:4:35,71
many critical parts need to be manufactured in China,

130
0:4:35,71 --> 0:4:37,32
they only handle the assembly and manufacturing,

131
0:4:37,32 --> 0:4:40,8
especially for products like iPhones and Teslas,

132
0:4:40,8 --> 0:4:41,83
the impact is the greatest,

133
0:4:41,83 --> 0:4:43,87
if you increase it to 104%,

134
0:4:43,87 --> 0:4:46,39
it actually only affects certain components,

135
0:4:46,39 --> 0:4:47,79
while some small businesses

136
0:4:47,79 --> 0:4:49,44
Like some things in America

137
0:4:49,44 --> 0:4:52,56
Frankly, your MAGA hats will be more expensive.

138
0:4:52,56 --> 0:4:53,4
You know?

139
0:4:53,4 --> 0:4:54,12
They used to sell for two dollars.

140
0:4:54,12 --> 0:4:55,36
Now they have to sell for four dollars.

141
0:4:55,36 --> 0:4:57,76
Of course, these items don’t have a huge impact.

142
0:4:57,76 --> 0:5:1,1
But many manufacturers in the U.S.

143
0:5:1,1 --> 0:5:4,28
either need packaging from China,

144
0:5:4,28 --> 0:5:7,71
or they need specific designs and manufacturing done in China.

145
0:5:7,71 --> 0:5:9,79
For instance, things you think are made in the U.S.

146
0:5:9,79 --> 0:5:10,59
Like lawn mowers.

147
0:5:10,59 --> 0:5:11,59
A bunch of miscellaneous items.

148
0:5:11,59 --> 0:5:13,75
But in fact, the industrial models inside,

149
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:15,81
The creation of some crucial components,

150
0:5:15,81 --> 0:5:17,37
American companies can't handle.

151
0:5:17,37 --> 0:5:18,93
So they have to turn to China.

152
0:5:18,93 --> 0:5:20,77
And there's a significant issue with American companies,

153
0:5:20,77 --> 0:5:21,89
Getting them to return to the U.S.

154
0:5:21,89 --> 0:5:23,6
He can't find such skilled workers

155
0:5:23,6 --> 0:5:24,52
He can't find such good companies

156
0:5:24,52 --> 0:5:26,44
Many of those American manufacturers

157
0:5:26,44 --> 0:5:28,96
Why he actually doesn't want to work with American companies

158
0:5:28,96 --> 0:5:31,4
It's not just about the price

159
0:5:32,16 --> 0:5:33,28
The minimum order quantity isn't sufficient

160
0:5:33,28 --> 0:5:35,11
They won't provide you with design drawings

161
0:5:35,11 --> 0:5:35,87
It gets too complicated

162
0:5:35,87 --> 0:5:38,11
He can't understand it, and they mess up the delivery

163
0:5:38,11 --> 0:5:39,27
If they ask you for a deposit

164
0:5:39,27 --> 0:5:40,23
All sorts of messy stuff

165
0:5:40,23 --> 0:5:41,81
He can't do a lot of things

166
0:5:41,81 --> 0:5:44,21
China's manufacturing industry is quite comprehensive

167
0:5:44,21 --> 0:5:45,99
So he can do a lot of things

168
0:5:45,99 --> 0:5:46,97
You know

169
0:5:46,97 --> 0:5:48,75
It's like playing a game

170
0:5:48,75 --> 0:5:50,55
You ask someone to craft an item for you

171
0:5:50,55 --> 0:5:52,53
These people tell you that you need to pay

172
0:5:52,53 --> 0:5:53,89
Then this one can't be made either

173
0:5:53,89 --> 0:5:54,73
That one can't be made either

174
0:5:54,73 --> 0:5:56,41
And the price is cheaper here

175
0:5:56,41 --> 0:5:57,59
And the shipping is fast

176
0:5:57,59 --> 0:5:59,37
And there are no unnecessary complications

177
0:5:59,37 --> 0:6:1,2
Just give me the CAD drawings

178
0:6:1,2 --> 0:6:4,94
So there's really no such thing as 100 percent American-made

179
0:6:4,94 --> 0:6:6,5
Or 100 percent Chinese-made

180
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:8,22
In fact, it's made in many different places

181
0:6:8,22 --> 0:6:9,58
Then everyone works together

182
0:6:9,58 --> 0:6:14,16
This is the true purpose of economic cooperation within the WTO

183
0:6:14,16 --> 0:6:18,19
Many things are not about one-sided gains

184
0:6:18,19 --> 0:6:20,19
A trade surplus means China earns money

185
0:6:20,19 --> 0:6:22,57
A trade deficit means the U.S. loses money

186
0:6:22,57 --> 0:6:24,23
It's not quite like that

187
0:6:24,23 --> 0:6:25,41
It's not that simple

188
0:6:25,41 --> 0:6:27,15
Many industries operate together

189
0:6:27,15 --> 0:6:29,1
It's possible that these components are produced in China

190
0:6:29,1 --> 0:6:30,3
Especially those items

191
0:6:30,3 --> 0:6:31,94
The critical design components are made in China

192
0:6:31,94 --> 0:6:32,78
For many things

193
0:6:32,78 --> 0:6:34,18
Some small businesses in the U.S.

194
0:6:34,18 --> 0:6:35,98
It feels like it was made in America.

195
0:6:35,98 --> 0:6:39,4
But in reality, most of the design and manufacturing is done in China

196
0:6:39,4 --> 0:6:41,5
It’s just branded differently in the back

197
0:6:41,37 --> 0:6:43,19
So who are you really affecting?

198
0:6:43,19 --> 0:6:44,85
You’re affecting yourself

199
0:6:44,85 --> 0:6:47,43
The cost of manufacturing in the U.S.

200
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:48,59
There are many other things.

201
0:6:48,59 --> 0:6:50,39
Things that are truly 100% made in China.

202
0:6:50,39 --> 0:6:52,55
Then there are serious items that the U.S. directly imports.

203
0:6:52,55 --> 0:6:53,95
Does it import BYD?

204
0:6:53,95 --> 0:6:55,63
Does it import the Type 81 rifle?

205
0:6:55,63 --> 0:6:56,39
No.

206
0:6:56,39 --> 0:6:57,51
What does it import?

207
0:6:57,51 --> 0:6:59,9
It imports groceries.

208
0:6:59,9 --> 0:7:0,53
some imported foods

209
0:7:0,53 --> 0:7:1,93
toys and such items

210
0:7:1,93 --> 0:7:4,35
he took care of those high-tech things

211
0:7:4,35 --> 0:7:5,47
he took care of the big river

212
0:7:5,47 --> 0:7:6,51
he took care of Huawei

213
0:7:6,51 --> 0:7:6,95
right?

214
0:7:6,95 --> 0:7:8,3
he took care of TikTok

215
0:7:8,3 --> 0:7:9,71
so he handles a lot of things like that

216
0:7:9,71 --> 0:7:12,1
but TikTok hasn't been completely dealt with yet

217
0:7:12,1 --> 0:7:14,33
But he won’t actually have anything.

218
0:7:14,33 --> 0:7:15,21
If he has alternatives,

219
0:7:15,21 --> 0:7:16,24
he won’t buy from China.

220
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:18,2
He won’t genuinely collaborate with China on these matters.

221
0:7:18,2 --> 0:7:20,16
Most of his business needs to work with China.

222
0:7:20,16 --> 0:7:22,49
It’s not that the U.S. is unwilling to buy,

223
0:7:22,49 --> 0:7:24,109
it’s just that buying from the U.S. is very expensive,

224
0:7:24,109 --> 0:7:24,889
and it’s also useless,

225
0:7:24,889 --> 0:7:27,12
and the key is that it can’t be done right now.

226
0:7:27,12 --> 0:7:30,16
So he is truly undermining the country's manufacturing sector

227
0:7:30,16 --> 0:7:31,55
and the country's employment

228
0:7:31,55 --> 0:7:33,47
He will continue to escalate these issues

229
0:7:33,47 --> 0:7:37,5
Then the basic goods people buy will become more expensive

230
0:7:37,5 --> 0:7:38,63
This is the impact on himself

231
0:7:38,63 --> 0:7:41,5
His 104 are his own consumers

232
0:7:41,5 --> 0:7:43,32
along with these small

233
0:7:43,32 --> 0:7:45,86
medium, and large enterprises that are bearing the costs

234
0:7:45,86 --> 0:7:49,1
Because there's nothing that can be produced 100 percent in America.

235
0:7:49,1 --> 0:7:50,78
Let's take a simple example.

236
0:7:50,78 --> 0:7:52,32
If you're a farmer in the U.S.

237
0:7:52,32 --> 0:7:54,74
Would you buy American farm equipment or Chinese farm equipment?

238
0:7:54,74 --> 0:7:56,62
Isn't it obvious?

239
0:7:56,62 --> 0:7:59,2
American farm equipment is so expensive.

240
0:7:59,48 --> 0:8:0,62
It's way too expensive.

241
0:8:0,62 --> 0:8:2,5
Chinese farm equipment is much more affordable.

242
0:8:2,5 --> 0:8:4,8
Of course, many things are done very well in the U.S.

243
0:8:4,8 --> 0:8:5,72
Let's be honest.

244
0:8:5,72 --> 0:8:7,9
But the price is just too high.

245
0:8:7,9 --> 0:8:9,7
Raising it by 400% won't help.

246
0:8:9,7 --> 0:8:11,14
There's a tenfold difference in price.

247
0:8:11,14 --> 0:8:12,6
Even if you raise it fourfold,

248
0:8:12,6 --> 0:8:13,5
it would still be four times higher.

249
0:8:13,5 --> 0:8:14,86
It would only have quadrupled.

250
0:8:14,86 --> 0:8:16,77
That's still 2.5 times off.

251
0:8:16,77 --> 0:8:18,57
So raising the prices won't make a difference.

252
0:8:18,57 --> 0:8:20,1
Even a 1000% increase wouldn't help.

253
0:8:20,1 --> 0:8:22,8
It has increased by 1000%

254
0:8:22,8 --> 0:8:25,34
which truly affects the producers, making it even more expensive

255
0:8:25,34 --> 0:8:26,72
So, what can we do about it?

256
0:8:26,72 --> 0:8:27,68
He doesn't have the capability anymore

257
0:8:27,68 --> 0:8:28,62
You know that, right?

258
0:8:28,62 --> 0:8:29,66
He doesn't have the capability

259
0:8:29,66 --> 0:8:31,62
He's not one hundred percent sure that everything can be produced in America.

260
0:8:31,62 --> 0:8:33,42
Those drug-addicted folks

261
0:8:33,42 --> 0:8:37,159
What can those lazy workers do all day?

262
0:8:37,159 --> 0:8:38,759
He relies on Mexicans too.

263
0:8:38,759 --> 0:8:41,319
He’s not one of those fat Americans.

264
0:8:41,319 --> 0:8:43,95
Can he really count on those bucks to help him?

265
0:8:43,95 --> 0:8:44,79
No way.

266
0:8:44,79 --> 0:8:46,97
So this is just a pipe dream.

267
0:8:46,97 --> 0:8:48,23
Let’s talk about some things.

268
0:8:48,23 --> 0:8:50,3
We don’t import American beef.

269
0:8:50,3 --> 0:8:50,91
We can use Argentine beef.

270
0:8:50,91 --> 0:8:52,72
We can use Brazilian beef as well.

271
0:8:52,72 --> 0:8:55,78
People from the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are all in competition.

272
0:8:55,78 --> 0:8:57,66
The US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are all major agricultural exporters.

273
0:8:57,66 --> 0:8:58,82
They are also major exporters of livestock products.

274
0:8:58,82 --> 0:8:59,94
We just buy from Australia.

275
0:8:59,94 --> 0:9:1,42
You just buy from Canada.

276
0:9:1,42 --> 0:9:2,5
When it comes to many of these items,

277
0:9:2,5 --> 0:9:3,86
And when we talk about agricultural products,

278
0:9:3,86 --> 0:9:4,96
Don't we produce them ourselves?

279
0:9:4,96 --> 0:9:6,2
It's just that, speaking of it,

280
0:9:6,2 --> 0:9:9,24
We need to import more things.

281
0:9:9,24 --> 0:9:10,6
The Import Expo also talks about this.

282
0:9:10,6 --> 0:9:11,84
We maintain a trade balance.

283
0:9:11,84 --> 0:9:13,88
We've always played the game by the rules.

284
0:9:13,88 --> 0:9:15,48
So when he really imposes these tariffs,

285
0:9:15,48 --> 0:9:16,99
He only hurts himself.

286
0:9:16,99 --> 0:9:19,15
He's pushing Americans into a corner.

287
0:9:19,15 --> 0:9:19,71
Really.

288
0:9:19,71 --> 0:9:20,91
And his term is four years.

289
0:9:20,91 --> 0:9:22,51
What are we going to do over the next three and a half years?

290
0:9:22,51 --> 0:9:23,95
It's really scary.

291
0:9:23,95 --> 0:9:25,75
To be honest, I usually don't criticize the U.S. much.

292
0:9:25,75 --> 0:9:27,15
I rarely criticize the U.S.

293
0:9:27,15 --> 0:9:27,43
Right?

294
0:9:27,43 --> 0:9:31,279
Because I think both China and the U.S., as major powers, have a lot of potential.

295
0:9:31,279 --> 0:9:33,19
We're moving forward, forward, always progressing.

296
0:9:33,19 --> 0:9:33,339
Right?

297
0:9:33,339 --> 0:9:33,979
Speaking for myself,

298
0:9:33,979 --> 0:9:36,499
I'm very optimistic about the various business opportunities in the U.S. in the future.

299
0:9:36,499 --> 0:9:37,539
But you can't play the game like this.

300
0:9:37,539 --> 0:9:38,93
Dude, if you keep playing like this,

301
0:9:38,93 --> 0:9:40,69
You won't have any opportunities left.

302
0:9:40,69 --> 0:9:41,73
If you keep this up,

303
0:9:41,73 --> 0:9:43,21
The economy will directly go into recession.

304
0:9:43,21 --> 0:9:45,9
So, not only is he not hurting the enemy by a thousand points,

305
0:9:45,9 --> 0:9:46,62
He's hurting himself by eight hundred.

306
0:9:46,62 --> 0:9:48,52
It's already hurting the enemy by eight hundred points,

307
0:9:48,52 --> 0:9:49,38
And hurting himself by ten thousand.

308
0:9:49,38 --> 0:9:50,64
That's really scary.

309
0:9:50,64 --> 0:9:52,3
Really.

310
0:9:52,3 --> 0:9:54,51
I think the U.S. is really a bit too late this time.

311
0:9:54,51 --> 0:9:56,47
This trade war has already backfired on itself.

312
0:9:56,47 --> 0:9:58,8
There's nothing left to fight over.
