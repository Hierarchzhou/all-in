1
0:0:0,22 --> 0:0:1,48
Hey everyone,

2
0:0:1,48 --> 0:0:2,84
another morning here.

3
0:0:2,84 --> 0:0:6,84
Look at Israel and Iran firing missiles at each other these past couple of days.

4
0:0:6,84 --> 0:0:8,91
It’s really heart-wrenching.

5
0:0:8,91 --> 0:0:12,82
Suddenly, it feels like life is so fragile,

6
0:0:12,82 --> 0:0:15,66
and often, fate is unpredictable.

7
0:0:15,66 --> 0:0:18,49
You never know when you might lose your life.

8
0:0:18,49 --> 0:0:20,25
When that day comes and you lose your life,

9
0:0:20,25 --> 0:0:21,65
would you feel regretful?

10
0:0:21,65 --> 0:0:23,41
You know, like yesterday in the live room,

11
0:0:23,41 --> 0:0:27,53
I was saying that after living for so many years,

12
0:0:27,53 --> 0:0:31,1
I gradually feel that it’s quite rewarding.

13
0:0:31,1 --> 0:0:34,38
Because when I was in my teens, some peers passed away,

14
0:0:34,38 --> 0:0:36,46
and in my twenties, some classmates in their thirties also went.

15
0:0:36,46 --> 0:0:38,6
A lot of people have left us.

16
0:0:38,6 --> 0:0:39,79
Many people,

17
0:0:40,47 --> 0:0:43,53
so over time, I’ve come to realize the unpredictability of life’s length,

18
0:0:43,53 --> 0:0:45,769
there’s a sense of unpredictability about it.

19
0:0:45,769 --> 0:0:48,49
This turns into a survival anxiety.

20
0:0:48,49 --> 0:0:49,879
But this survival anxiety,

21
0:0:49,879 --> 0:0:53,79
after a while, you'll find it diminishes,

22
0:0:53,79 --> 0:0:54,559
you won't be as afraid anymore.

23
0:0:54,559 --> 0:0:56,279
I think that's how it is.

24
0:0:56,279 --> 0:0:58,65
Often, it's dialectical.

25
0:0:58,65 --> 0:1:0,93
I believe in living life,

26
0:1:0,93 --> 0:1:4,25
If there's anything that's essential,

27
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:5,77
I think it's that you must keep living.

28
0:1:5,77 --> 0:1:8,21
There's a reason for you to keep living

29
0:1:8,21 --> 0:1:9,1
It has to be important

30
0:1:9,1 --> 0:1:11,44
Many people just can't find this reason

31
0:1:11,44 --> 0:1:13,36
Because life is unpredictable

32
0:1:13,36 --> 0:1:14,12
When one day

33
0:1:14,12 --> 0:1:17,16
You truly understand what life is all about

34
0:1:17,16 --> 0:1:21,1
You'll realize that life is unpredictable

35
0:1:21,1 --> 0:1:22,88
It might even be meaningless

36
0:1:22,88 --> 0:1:24,88
In many cases

37
0:1:24,88 --> 0:1:28,96
You realize that things you once thought were so important

38
0:1:28,96 --> 0:1:30,2
like buying a house or a car

39
0:1:30,2 --> 0:1:30,78
getting married

40
0:1:30,78 --> 0:1:31,7
living in a big house

41
0:1:31,7 --> 0:1:33,8
or holding a high-ranking position, might not be as easy as you thought

42
0:1:33,8 --> 0:1:36,58
It’s not always that simple to achieve them

43
0:1:36,58 --> 0:1:40,37
The reality is that sometimes just finding a job

44
0:1:40,37 --> 0:1:42,43
and maintaining your own survival can be really tough

45
0:1:42,43 --> 0:1:44,91
This is the true nature of human society

46
0:1:44,91 --> 0:1:46,51
But one day you'll find

47
0:1:46,51 --> 0:1:48,79
that your life keeps moving forward

48
0:1:48,79 --> 0:1:52,4
and some of the old troubles gradually fade away

49
0:1:52,4 --> 0:1:54,9
replaced by new ones

50
0:1:54,9 --> 0:1:57,64
you spend your life constantly solving problems

51
0:1:57,64 --> 0:2:0,17
and generating new ones

52
0:2:0,17 --> 0:2:2,31
when you're young, you have the worries of youth

53
0:2:2,31 --> 0:2:4,5
and when you're old, you face the pains of aging

54
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:6,25
for instance, I'm 40 now

55
0:2:6,25 --> 0:2:7,39
No matter what

56
0:2:7,39 --> 0:2:9,51
losing weight has become a really difficult task

57
0:2:9,51 --> 0:2:11,59
I've never been worried about my weight before

58
0:2:11,59 --> 0:2:14,48
I've never been concerned about how much I eat

59
0:2:14,48 --> 0:2:17,72
but now I find that even eating a little bit makes me feel full

60
0:2:17,72 --> 0:2:21,1
and yet the weight won't budge, which is quite a peculiar situation

61
0:2:21,1 --> 0:2:23,61
and now, I have to take several breaks throughout the day

62
0:2:23,61 --> 0:2:25,41
otherwise, I can't maintain my energy levels

63
0:2:25,41 --> 0:2:27,21
otherwise, my energy just won’t be sufficient

64
0:2:27,21 --> 0:2:28,55
Unlike before,

65
0:2:28,55 --> 0:2:30,32
you can't stay up for days at a time anymore.

66
0:2:30,32 --> 0:2:32,84
You might find yourself gradually losing

67
0:2:32,84 --> 0:2:35,32
the meaning of life.

68
0:2:35,32 --> 0:2:38,38
At this point, I'd like to remind young friends,

69
0:2:38,38 --> 0:2:42,65
why not take the opportunity to explore famous mountains and rivers?

70
0:2:42,65 --> 0:2:45,9
Why not read some biographies of historical figures?

71
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:49,87
Or watch some war dramas?

72
0:2:49,87 --> 0:2:51,93
We're talking about some old films, for instance.

73
0:2:51,93 --> 0:2:54,45
You need to find the meaning of your existence.

74
0:2:54,45 --> 0:2:56,93
Actually, I think it’s something you gradually discover.

75
0:2:56,93 --> 0:3:0,21
Finding the purpose of my life.

76
0:3:0,21 --> 0:3:2,47
There are actually two key points.

77
0:3:2,47 --> 0:3:5,13
One is why I used to be so eager to act.

78
0:3:5,13 --> 0:3:10,29
Why I was so passionate about making movies.

79
0:3:10,29 --> 0:3:12,93
At that time, there was a line from the Big Bang Theory.

80
0:3:12,93 --> 0:3:14,89
It was HOWARD WOLOWITZ who said,

81
0:3:14,89 --> 0:3:18,52
He said he was performing magic when acting.

82
0:3:18,52 --> 0:3:21,36
He realized that in that brief moment,

83
0:3:21,36 --> 0:3:24,12
his mother had actually forgotten some of the pain in her life.

84
0:3:24,12 --> 0:3:27,149
He felt that this was truly precious.

85
0:3:27,149 --> 0:3:30,629
It was then that I saw my classmate,

86
0:3:30,629 --> 0:3:34,61
and my teacher, smiling at the play I was performing.

87
0:3:34,61 --> 0:3:38,25
They all shared a knowing smile.

88
0:3:38,25 --> 0:3:40,29
Everyone was so happy.

89
0:3:40,29 --> 0:3:41,73
Especially when I was in France,

90
0:3:41,73 --> 0:3:43,24
and in Canada.

91
0:3:43,24 --> 0:3:45,82
These two countries don't even speak the same language

92
0:3:45,82 --> 0:3:46,98
they aren't even from the same ethnic group

93
0:3:46,98 --> 0:3:48,8
nor do they share the same culture

94
0:3:48,8 --> 0:3:51,34
but everyone still cheered when I came on stage

95
0:3:51,34 --> 0:3:52,22
it was just this play

96
0:3:52,22 --> 0:3:53,66
it might not have been anyone else's business

97
0:3:53,66 --> 0:3:55,28
it might not have been my own work either

98
0:3:55,28 --> 0:3:57,13
but I was just helping a classmate perform in a play

99
0:3:57,13 --> 0:3:58,71
the moment I stepped on stage

100
0:3:58,71 --> 0:4:0,3
Everyone started laughing

101
0:4:0,3 --> 0:4:1,5
Then I realized

102
0:4:1,5 --> 0:4:5,12
I have this ability to bring joy to people

103
0:4:5,12 --> 0:4:7,44
And everyone acknowledged my acting skills

104
0:4:7,44 --> 0:4:9,64
So from that moment on, I began to

105
0:4:9,64 --> 0:4:10,76
I was determined to pursue this path

106
0:4:10,76 --> 0:4:12,52
I committed myself to this career

107
0:4:12,52 --> 0:4:14,68
Later, after gradually returning to my home country

108
0:4:14,68 --> 0:4:15,88
I found myself in the entertainment industry

109
0:4:15,88 --> 0:4:19,39
It might not be as ideal as we once imagined.

110
0:4:19,39 --> 0:4:22,57
But this isn't just a domestic issue.

111
0:4:22,57 --> 0:4:25,0
Initially, when we started making web films in China,

112
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:28,32
and even now with short dramas, they can generate a lot of money.

113
0:4:28,32 --> 0:4:29,92
With the potential to earn a lot of money,

114
0:4:29,92 --> 0:4:31,22
it’s possible to achieve social mobility.

115
0:4:31,22 --> 0:4:33,39
This is actually a positive thing.

116
0:4:33,39 --> 0:4:35,319
In contrast, the market abroad isn’t as large,

117
0:4:35,319 --> 0:4:36,279
and doesn’t have the same scale.

118
0:4:36,279 --> 0:4:37,26
It might actually be harder to do.

119
0:4:37,26 --> 0:4:38,38
So, to be honest,

120
0:4:38,38 --> 0:4:40,7
It's not that the films I made abroad were very pure,

121
0:4:40,7 --> 0:4:41,9
and I can't make them back home.

122
0:4:41,9 --> 0:4:42,92
That's not what I mean.

123
0:4:42,92 --> 0:4:47,8
Rather, I've noticed that my way of living is gradually changing.

124
0:4:47,8 --> 0:4:49,22
I want to make a living,

125
0:4:49,22 --> 0:4:51,54
and to achieve my artistic aspirations,

126
0:4:51,54 --> 0:4:53,74
that's not an easy task.

127
0:4:53,74 --> 0:4:54,82
But I did mention it.

128
0:4:54,82 --> 0:4:57,4
This idea, this concept of mine,

129
0:4:57,4 --> 0:5:1,44
if we think big, it's about serving the people,

130
0:5:1,44 --> 0:5:5,18
the intention to alleviate the people's pain and worries hasn't changed.

131
0:5:5,18 --> 0:5:8,39
I still believe my art has value.

132
0:5:8,83 --> 0:5:11,43
I want to help the audience who watch my shows,

133
0:5:11,43 --> 0:5:13,799
to take away some of life's worries.

134
0:5:13,799 --> 0:5:15,819
But later I found out,

135
0:5:15,819 --> 0:5:17,679
since I started making short videos,

136
0:5:17,679 --> 0:5:19,279
Doing this kind of chat show with everyone

137
0:5:19,279 --> 0:5:22,58
At first, I thought it was a way for me to express some

138
0:5:22,58 --> 0:5:23,38
Things I wanted to say

139
0:5:23,38 --> 0:5:26,44
But as I kept doing it, I realized

140
0:5:26,44 --> 0:5:28,88
It has a certain aspect of serving others

141
0:5:28,88 --> 0:5:31,909
Benefiting the public

142
0:5:31,909 --> 0:5:33,109
And this aspect

143
0:5:33,109 --> 0:5:36,29
Also helps alleviate my anxiety about survival

144
0:5:36,29 --> 0:5:37,89
Through various explorations

145
0:5:37,89 --> 0:5:38,689
Because he can make money too

146
0:5:38,689 --> 0:5:41,59
So earning money motivates me to do more

147
0:5:41,59 --> 0:5:43,99
So I gradually found my direction

148
0:5:43,99 --> 0:5:47,59
And the key reason why I particularly love this career at this time

149
0:5:47,59 --> 0:5:50,19
Is that it's more enjoyable than when I was an actor

150
0:5:50,19 --> 0:5:51,9
More enjoyable than filming movies

151
0:5:51,9 --> 0:5:56,46
Because I truly feel the impact on so many people

152
0:5:56,46 --> 0:6:0,46
The shows I produce boost their confidence

153
0:6:0,46 --> 0:6:3,16
I feel encouraged in life

154
0:6:3,16 --> 0:6:4,5
I feel that life has meaning

155
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:6,32
Things are gradually getting better

156
0:6:6,32 --> 0:6:7,2
I've been encouraged

157
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:8,32
So, this thing

158
0:6:8,32 --> 0:6:11,0
It's about inspiring people to do good

159
0:6:11,0 --> 0:6:12,68
What we call helping others

160
0:6:12,68 --> 0:6:14,4
Being able to help oneself and others

161
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:15,72
This is a really great thing

162
0:6:15,72 --> 0:6:18,88
So I feel like I've found my true purpose in life

163
0:6:18,88 --> 0:6:20,96
I wasn't actually into acting at first

164
0:6:20,96 --> 0:6:22,14
Of course, acting is great too

165
0:6:22,14 --> 0:6:24,14
Becoming famous and making a lot of money is good as well

166
0:6:24,14 --> 0:6:25,63
But that wasn't my original intention

167
0:6:25,63 --> 0:6:27,539
My original intention was to help people

168
0:6:27,539 --> 0:6:31,219
To help people alleviate the hardships in their lives

169
0:6:31,219 --> 0:6:32,819
So for me, performing crosstalk

170
0:6:32,819 --> 0:6:34,3
Doing talk shows

171
0:6:34,3 --> 0:6:35,89
Telling stories or acting

172
0:6:35,89 --> 0:6:38,3
Acting in movies or making short videos?

173
0:6:38,3 --> 0:6:40,2
Voice-overs are the same.

174
0:6:40,2 --> 0:6:42,2
It’s all about serving others.

175
0:6:42,2 --> 0:6:45,12
This quality and spirit of serving the people is what matters.

176
0:6:45,12 --> 0:6:47,1
I’m not just flattering myself.

177
0:6:47,1 --> 0:6:48,73
I genuinely have this mindset.

178
0:6:48,73 --> 0:6:50,69
For me personally,

179
0:6:50,69 --> 0:6:53,53
When I act, people follow me,

180
0:6:53,53 --> 0:6:55,97
And my performance can bring joy to everyone.

181
0:6:55,97 --> 0:6:59,95
This has been my consistent life goal since childhood.

182
0:6:59,95 --> 0:7:1,49
This is what I care about.

183
0:7:1,49 --> 0:7:3,899
This is what I strive to hone.

184
0:7:3,899 --> 0:7:6,599
That's why I went abroad to practice this.

185
0:7:6,599 --> 0:7:7,819
It takes a long time.

186
0:7:7,819 --> 0:7:8,639
It costs a lot of money.

187
0:7:8,639 --> 0:7:10,63
It takes my youth.

188
0:7:10,63 --> 0:7:11,89
To practice this skill.

189
0:7:11,89 --> 0:7:12,91
To control my emotions.

190
0:7:12,91 --> 0:7:15,549
Shaping characters and such things

191
0:7:15,549 --> 0:7:19,269
So over the years, my investments have finally paid off

192
0:7:19,269 --> 0:7:21,769
That's what I feel really good about

193
0:7:21,769 --> 0:7:22,869
And as I've mentioned before

194
0:7:22,869 --> 0:7:25,94
Actually, what I focus on more is

195
0:7:25,94 --> 0:7:28,7
For instance, accidents involving children

196
0:7:28,7 --> 0:7:29,86
All sorts of things

197
0:7:29,86 --> 0:7:31,96
Like leaving your child in the car during summer

198
0:7:31,96 --> 0:7:33,12
Or something like that

199
0:7:33,12 --> 0:7:34,6
I went out to play by myself

200
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:35,26
The elderly stayed at home to take care of the child

201
0:7:35,26 --> 0:7:36,6
The elderly person passed away

202
0:7:36,6 --> 0:7:37,46
Then the child was left to starve to death

203
0:7:37,46 --> 0:7:40,55
Incidents like this had a profound impact on me

204
0:7:40,55 --> 0:7:43,63
Especially the deaths and injuries of minors

205
0:7:43,63 --> 0:7:45,73
All sorts of cases involving illnesses and suffering

206
0:7:45,73 --> 0:7:47,33
It made me think

207
0:7:47,33 --> 0:7:49,41
I started from 2022

208
0:7:49,41 --> 0:7:50,61
Starting in 2002

209
0:7:50,61 --> 0:7:52,919
I became an 18-year-old adult

210
0:7:52,919 --> 0:7:56,659
So anyone who wasn't an adult before 2002

211
0:7:56,659 --> 0:7:58,239
is a kid to me

212
0:7:58,239 --> 0:8:1,49
which means I have a natural affinity for children

213
0:8:1,49 --> 0:8:3,129
and I pay special attention to their growth

214
0:8:3,129 --> 0:8:8,49
and I'm particularly concerned about the impact of such accidents on young people

215
0:8:8,49 --> 0:8:10,969
so back then I made a vow

216
0:8:10,969 --> 0:8:14,5
that if I were to die

217
0:8:14,5 --> 0:8:17,2
It would be great to become something like a guardian angel.

218
0:8:17,2 --> 0:8:22,12
For instance, if a child is locked in a car.

219
0:8:22,12 --> 0:8:23,16
When they call for help,

220
0:8:23,16 --> 0:8:26,38
I could step in like a superhero to help these kids.

221
0:8:26,38 --> 0:8:30,49
I have this simple and heartfelt wish.

222
0:8:30,49 --> 0:8:34,249
Bro Rong managed to complete Silent Hill using only cold weapons.

223
0:8:34,249 --> 0:8:36,369
You know, in Mute Village.

224
0:8:36,369 --> 0:8:40,36
Throughout the series, I mostly avoid using firearms.

225
0:8:40,36 --> 0:8:42,4
I just go through with cold weapons.

226
0:8:42,4 --> 0:8:43,9
Because I think a horror game

227
0:8:43,9 --> 0:8:45,81
loses its fear when you can fight back.

228
0:8:45,81 --> 0:8:47,79
So every time I play a horror game,

229
0:8:47,79 --> 0:8:49,93
the second line says you're terrorizing the people,

230
0:8:53,96 --> 0:8:56,22
and the third line says I'm here to uphold justice.

231
0:8:56,22 --> 0:8:58,94
Just these three lines,

232
0:8:58,94 --> 0:8:59,92
three golden truths,

233
0:8:59,92 --> 0:9:1,6
once you enter the game, you're basically invincible.

234
0:9:1,6 --> 0:9:3,8
Once you get into this game, you're basically invincible.

235
0:9:3,8 --> 0:9:4,92
an indestructible body

236
0:9:4,92 --> 0:9:6,4
because we who practice swordsmanship

237
0:9:6,4 --> 0:9:7,68
as martial artists

238
0:9:7,68 --> 0:9:8,72
have quick reflexes

239
0:9:8,72 --> 0:9:10,44
can easily dodge the opponent's attacks

240
0:9:10,44 --> 0:9:11,2
when playing games

241
0:9:11,2 --> 0:9:11,6
right?

242
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:13,3
it's not like in real life

243
0:9:13,3 --> 0:9:14,9
in real life, we can dodge attacks too

244
0:9:14,9 --> 0:9:15,88
Let's not talk about this kind of thing.

245
0:9:15,88 --> 0:9:18,8
So, it has had a tremendous positive impact on my life.

246
0:9:18,8 --> 0:9:20,76
A positive and significant boost, you might say.

247
0:9:20,76 --> 0:9:22,32
Why am I saying all this?

248
0:9:22,32 --> 0:9:25,12
I'm saying this in response to a request from our audience today.

249
0:9:25,12 --> 0:9:28,96
There will come a day when you find the meaning of your life.

250
0:9:28,96 --> 0:9:30,61
Once you find it, your life will no longer be aimless.

251
0:9:30,61 --> 0:9:34,17
The meaning of life is the reason you're willing to die for.

252
0:9:34,17 --> 0:9:35,25
A cause, a mission.

253
0:9:35,25 --> 0:9:37,56
A great cause

254
0:9:37,56 --> 0:9:39,24
Indeed, a great cause

255
0:9:39,24 --> 0:9:44,2
My great cause is to save children from suffering

256
0:9:44,2 --> 0:9:47,5
And then to uphold justice for the people

257
0:9:47,5 --> 0:9:48,82
To engage in righteous causes

258
0:9:48,82 --> 0:9:53,3
And then to do things that harm others and are not beneficial to oneself

259
0:9:53,3 --> 0:9:54,29
Not to harm others and not be beneficial to oneself

260
0:9:54,29 --> 0:9:56,5
To do things that harm oneself but not others

261
0:9:56,5 --> 0:9:58,579
Things that harm oneself but benefit others

262
0:9:58,979 --> 0:10:2,139
At the end of the day, it's about serving others

263
0:10:2,139 --> 0:10:3,119
serving the people

264
0:10:3,119 --> 0:10:6,7
walking the path of serving the public

265
0:10:6,7 --> 0:10:8,37
whether your career is in comedy

266
0:10:8,37 --> 0:10:9,51
being a clown

267
0:10:9,51 --> 0:10:10,51
entertaining everyone

268
0:10:10,51 --> 0:10:12,35
or being a trusted older brother

269
0:10:12,35 --> 0:10:13,31
a trusted uncle

270
0:10:13,31 --> 0:10:15,19
helping everyone ease their pain

271
0:10:15,19 --> 0:10:16,53
For me,

272
0:10:16,53 --> 0:10:18,37
this achievement is definitely spiritual.

273
0:10:18,37 --> 0:10:19,63
For me,

274
0:10:19,63 --> 0:10:20,67
no matter what you do,

275
0:10:20,67 --> 0:10:22,75
you'll find that as long as you are serving the people,

276
0:10:22,75 --> 0:10:24,3
it's a significant matter.

277
0:10:24,3 --> 0:10:27,2
because I believe, as part of a community with a shared future for mankind,

278
0:10:27,2 --> 0:10:29,26
I chose to be born in this country,

279
0:10:29,26 --> 0:10:31,559
I feel it's, how can I put it,

280
0:10:31,559 --> 0:10:33,35
A great honor indeed

281
0:10:33,35 --> 0:10:35,47
Because from one perspective

282
0:10:35,47 --> 0:10:37,55
When we talk about our country

283
0:10:37,55 --> 0:10:40,57
From the Machiavellian standpoint

284
0:10:40,57 --> 0:10:43,65
Including the stance against neutrality

285
0:10:43,65 --> 0:10:45,53
Neutrality often leads to the greatest loss

286
0:10:45,53 --> 0:10:47,9
One should support one side

287
0:10:47,9 --> 0:10:51,72
You'll find that our country has a sense of conviction

288
0:10:51,72 --> 0:10:53,9
A commitment to doing what is right

289
0:10:53,9 --> 0:10:56,7
I mean, in this chaotic world,

290
0:10:56,7 --> 0:10:59,66
I've endured so much suffering myself,

291
0:10:59,66 --> 0:11:1,34
and the people have endured so much suffering,

292
0:11:1,34 --> 0:11:3,93
I absolutely cannot let that suffering happen again.

293
0:11:3,93 --> 0:11:6,55
I can't let it happen to myself again,

294
0:11:6,55 --> 0:11:8,21
and I must do it for the enemy country as well,

295
0:11:12,329 --> 0:11:15,429
so we always stand on the side of justice.

296
0:11:15,429 --> 0:11:17,129
Considering the gains and losses,

297
0:11:17,129 --> 0:11:21,74
and from the perspective of this strategy,

298
0:11:21,74 --> 0:11:23,32
From a political science perspective

299
0:11:23,32 --> 0:11:25,24
we are definitely at a disadvantage here

300
0:11:25,24 --> 0:11:27,51
but because of our strength

301
0:11:27,51 --> 0:11:29,87
we can afford to take this hit

302
0:11:29,87 --> 0:11:31,69
it's like I'm wielding a cold weapon

303
0:11:31,69 --> 0:11:34,59
in a world full of villains and evil spirits

304
0:11:34,59 --> 0:11:35,8
wandering around

305
0:11:35,8 --> 0:11:37,88
you'll find that horror movies are scary

306
0:11:37,88 --> 0:11:40,52
because what's truly terrifying is the evil in human hearts

307
0:11:40,52 --> 0:11:42,21
These are the things, right?

308
0:11:42,21 --> 0:11:43,85
Of course, when we talk about it,

309
0:11:43,85 --> 0:11:46,59
In reality, one needs to have a Machiavellian mindset,

310
0:11:46,59 --> 0:11:49,39
Because you have to understand that human nature is complex.

311
0:11:49,39 --> 0:11:51,39
When you adopt an idealistic approach,

312
0:11:51,39 --> 0:11:53,35
A persistent attitude towards goodness,

313
0:11:53,35 --> 0:11:55,61
You might find yourself overlooking things,

314
0:11:55,61 --> 0:11:58,67
You might be misled by those who don’t know the full story,

315
0:11:58,67 --> 0:12:0,43
Or, how should I put it,

316
0:12:0,43 --> 0:12:2,67
The little villain will drain your energy.

317
0:12:2,67 --> 0:12:4,9
This is the true believer.

318
0:12:4,9 --> 0:12:8,49
A common mistake made by the purest and most benevolent idealist warriors.

319
0:12:8,49 --> 0:12:10,53
So, speaking of the current dozen or so aspects,

320
0:12:10,53 --> 0:12:13,3
I am working towards a reconciliation in this life.

321
0:12:13,3 --> 0:12:14,66
Promoting a form of realism.

322
0:12:14,66 --> 0:12:16,1
One must also have a conscience.

323
0:12:16,1 --> 0:12:17,8
Idealism should also have some strategy.

324
0:12:17,8 --> 0:12:19,69
That's the idea.

325
0:12:19,69 --> 0:12:21,749
Gradually guide him towards a more comprehensive direction

326
0:12:21,749 --> 0:12:22,789
So, speaking of that

327
0:12:22,789 --> 0:12:24,769
How should we navigate our lives

328
0:12:24,769 --> 0:12:27,21
What kind of beliefs should we establish in our lives

329
0:12:27,21 --> 0:12:28,45
You are who you are

330
0:12:28,45 --> 0:12:29,65
And you should establish beliefs that reflect who you are

331
0:12:29,65 --> 0:12:31,37
Not everything has to be the same as mine

332
0:12:31,37 --> 0:12:32,21
It’s all good

333
0:12:32,21 --> 0:12:34,97
What I’m saying is essentially abstract and intangible

334
0:12:34,97 --> 0:12:36,13
But in reality

335
0:12:36,13 --> 0:12:37,85
I think living each day

336
0:12:37,85 --> 0:12:38,45
when you open your eyes

337
0:12:38,45 --> 0:12:41,47
you must know what you're living for

338
0:12:41,47 --> 0:12:43,7
what beliefs you're living for

339
0:12:43,7 --> 0:12:45,25
when one day your beliefs collapse

340
0:12:45,25 --> 0:12:48,7
you feel that life has less meaning

341
0:12:48,7 --> 0:12:49,3
speaking for myself

342
0:12:49,3 --> 0:12:51,11
I'm definitely not living for material enjoyment

343
0:12:51,11 --> 0:12:54,5
Material desires are basically nonexistent for me.

344
0:12:54,5 --> 0:12:56,25
To be more precise, it's not that they don't exist.

345
0:12:56,25 --> 0:12:57,95
They are just meaningless.

346
0:12:57,95 --> 0:13:0,69
So what if you have everything you desire?

347
0:13:0,69 --> 0:13:3,79
So often, you might wonder, am I really that lustful?

348
0:13:3,79 --> 0:13:5,9
If I were really lustful, I would—

349
0:13:5,9 --> 0:13:6,79
I wouldn't say things like 'little sister' and 'WeiWei'.

350
0:13:6,79 --> 0:13:9,19
I wouldn't push people away.

351
0:13:9,19 --> 0:13:10,89
Are you really that concerned about these things?

352
0:13:10,89 --> 0:13:13,9
What if Mi Su Qi gives me one?

353
0:13:13,9 --> 0:13:14,25
You're not a Ferrari, after all.

354
0:13:14,25 --> 0:13:14,77
Right?

355
0:13:14,77 --> 0:13:16,99
So, what's the point of enjoying it?

356
0:13:16,99 --> 0:13:18,91
Are you really willing to spend tens of millions,

357
0:13:18,91 --> 0:13:20,39
or even hundreds of millions, to build a grand castle?

358
0:13:20,39 --> 0:13:20,99
A huge house,

359
0:13:20,99 --> 0:13:22,47
and then have no family members,

360
0:13:22,47 --> 0:13:23,95
or friends living in it?

361
0:13:23,95 --> 0:13:25,59
An empty room with just one person

362
0:13:25,59 --> 0:13:26,87
Even going to the bathroom requires leaving the lights on

363
0:13:26,87 --> 0:13:27,7
afraid of the dark

364
0:13:27,7 --> 0:13:27,57
and needing to hire a bodyguard

365
0:13:27,57 --> 0:13:28,75
Do you really want to live like this?

366
0:13:28,75 --> 0:13:30,63
Since you don’t want to live this way

367
0:13:30,63 --> 0:13:32,23
then why strive so hard

368
0:13:32,23 --> 0:13:33,31
to accumulate so much material wealth?

369
0:13:33,31 --> 0:13:34,79
accumulated so much material wealth

370
0:13:34,79 --> 0:13:35,73
And for what, exactly?

371
0:13:35,73 --> 0:13:37,43
Oh, you're doing it for freedom.

372
0:13:37,43 --> 0:13:40,6
To avoid bowing down for a living.

373
0:13:40,6 --> 0:13:42,92
You're doing it so your family can have excellent medical care

374
0:13:42,92 --> 0:13:44,11
and living conditions.

375
0:13:44,11 --> 0:13:45,99
You're striving for these things.

376
0:13:45,99 --> 0:13:48,71
You're doing it to have enough time to reflect on yourself,

377
0:13:48,71 --> 0:13:49,73
to ponder life.

378
0:13:49,73 --> 0:13:50,59
Especially someone like Brother Rong.

379
0:13:50,59 --> 0:13:51,9
Now I'm reading some books

380
0:13:51,9 --> 0:13:53,56
I really enjoy reading these days

381
0:13:53,56 --> 0:13:53,98
Why is that?

382
0:13:53,98 --> 0:13:55,98
Because I have a very strong belief

383
0:13:55,98 --> 0:13:59,1
That every bit of reading I do

384
0:13:59,1 --> 0:14:1,269
Every bit of growth I gain

385
0:14:1,269 --> 0:14:2,629
For everyone else

386
0:14:2,629 --> 0:14:5,89
It has a compounding effect

387
0:14:5,89 --> 0:14:6,769
I have 670,000 followers

388
0:14:6,769 --> 0:14:7,849
There are 800,000 across the web

389
0:14:7,849 --> 0:14:8,649
There are a million

390
0:14:8,649 --> 0:14:9,369
No matter what

391
0:14:9,369 --> 0:14:10,609
Regardless of the actual number

392
0:14:10,609 --> 0:14:11,46
It doesn’t matter

393
0:14:11,46 --> 0:14:12,58
My thoughts

394
0:14:12,58 --> 0:14:13,62
I have so many slices

395
0:14:13,62 --> 0:14:15,51
It will eventually spread out

396
0:14:15,51 --> 0:14:17,35
So I’m now very focused on rebirth

397
0:14:17,35 --> 0:14:18,67
It's one's own thoughts

398
0:14:18,67 --> 0:14:21,69
We need to frequently correct our thoughts

399
0:14:21,69 --> 0:14:23,309
For instance, sometimes I have certain values

400
0:14:23,309 --> 0:14:24,789
Frankly, they're not worth spreading

401
0:14:24,789 --> 0:14:27,46
But I find that followers tend to imitate me

402
0:14:27,46 --> 0:14:28,82
They mimic the way I speak

403
0:14:28,82 --> 0:14:29,86
They mimic how I insult others

404
0:14:29,86 --> 0:14:33,0
They even copy some of my crude language

405
0:14:33,0 --> 0:14:34,1
Actually, to be honest

406
0:14:34,1 --> 0:14:35,55
You know, sometimes

407
0:14:35,55 --> 0:14:37,13
the live stream gives me a warning

408
0:14:37,13 --> 0:14:38,79
or the review team provides feedback

409
0:14:38,79 --> 0:14:40,16
I always accept it humbly

410
0:14:40,16 --> 0:14:42,92
because I believe once someone has value in spreading information

411
0:14:42,92 --> 0:14:43,8
and has influence

412
0:14:43,8 --> 0:14:45,39
they need to be cautious

413
0:14:45,39 --> 0:14:48,67
especially when their content might reach minors

414
0:14:48,67 --> 0:14:50,47
so it's important to set the right values for everyone

415
0:14:50,47 --> 0:14:51,62
What kind of values

416
0:14:51,62 --> 0:14:52,86
What kind of outlook on life

417
0:14:52,86 --> 0:14:55,84
What kind of sense of mission is truly useful

418
0:14:55,84 --> 0:14:57,86
I think in this regard

419
0:14:57,86 --> 0:14:59,71
My country is always at a disadvantage

420
0:14:59,71 --> 0:15:2,3
But when it's at a disadvantage

421
0:15:2,3 --> 0:15:3,21
There's always a saying

422
0:15:3,21 --> 0:15:4,39
That goes like this

423
0:15:4,39 --> 0:15:6,95
Those who sow in tears will reap with joy

424
0:15:6,95 --> 0:15:10,39
You'll find that we mostly spread good deeds.

425
0:15:10,39 --> 0:15:11,61
When it comes to gains and losses,

426
0:15:11,61 --> 0:15:12,99
we are definitely at a disadvantage.

427
0:15:12,99 --> 0:15:14,99
If we look at it from a business perspective,

428
0:15:14,99 --> 0:15:15,47
right?

429
0:15:15,47 --> 0:15:16,99
You're not selling Trump-branded watches,

430
0:15:16,99 --> 0:15:18,43
nor are you selling Trump phones,

431
0:15:18,43 --> 0:15:19,63
you are definitely at a disadvantage.

432
0:15:19,63 --> 0:15:22,53
But many things can't be measured by business standards.

433
0:15:22,53 --> 0:15:24,17
In most senses,

434
0:15:24,17 --> 0:15:25,65
it was precisely because when our country was founded,

435
0:15:25,65 --> 0:15:27,21
there were many idealists,

436
0:15:27,21 --> 0:15:28,33
who dedicated their lives,

437
0:15:28,33 --> 0:15:29,11
sacrificed themselves,

438
0:15:29,11 --> 0:15:30,41
that we have today.

439
0:15:30,41 --> 0:15:32,4
However, idealism alone is not enough.

440
0:15:32,4 --> 0:15:35,4
Idealism alone cannot address the realities of

441
0:15:35,4 --> 0:15:36,58
a very harsh world.

442
0:15:36,58 --> 0:15:38,18
So, it's essential to have strength.

443
0:15:38,18 --> 0:15:40,26
In reality,

444
0:15:40,26 --> 0:15:42,9
the prerequisite for upholding justice is having strength.

445
0:15:42,9 --> 0:15:44,2
This is crucial.

446
0:15:44,2 --> 0:15:45,46
That's why,

447
0:15:45,46 --> 0:15:49,39
it's precisely because Earth has a mixed polarity presence,

448
0:15:49,39 --> 0:15:51,6
right here,

449
0:15:51,6 --> 0:15:53,48
just being fixated on goodness isn't enough.

450
0:15:53,48 --> 0:15:54,46
Besides having love,

451
0:15:54,46 --> 0:15:55,9
You still have wisdom.

452
0:15:55,9 --> 0:15:56,9
This is crucial.

453
0:15:56,9 --> 0:16:0,11
You have a knack for seeing through everything.

454
0:16:0,11 --> 0:16:2,67
Sometimes you need to wear a bad guy's mask.

455
0:16:2,67 --> 0:16:4,56
To be a good person.

456
0:16:4,56 --> 0:16:8,16
Just like many bad guys wear a good guy's mask to do evil.

457
0:16:8,16 --> 0:16:9,48
So, in many cases,

458
0:16:9,48 --> 0:16:10,9
In this world,

459
0:16:10,9 --> 0:16:12,22
Who is the true angel?

460
0:16:12,22 --> 0:16:13,22
Who is the real demon?

461
0:16:13,22 --> 0:16:14,48
You can't tell, can you?

462
0:16:15,46 --> 0:16:16,55
Great deceit appears as truth.

463
0:16:16,55 --> 0:16:18,11
So, let's go back to today.

464
0:16:18,11 --> 0:16:19,15
Go back to the last day.

465
0:16:19,15 --> 0:16:21,19
Go back to the final day of your life.

466
0:16:21,19 --> 0:16:23,23
Go back to the first day of your life.

467
0:16:23,23 --> 0:16:26,11
What have you been striving for in your life?

468
0:16:26,11 --> 0:16:28,5
You need to keep refining it.

469
0:16:28,5 --> 0:16:29,98
The current answer might not be the right one.

470
0:16:29,98 --> 0:16:31,9
Perhaps one day when you're older,

471
0:16:31,9 --> 0:16:32,62
as you continue to grow,

472
0:16:32,62 --> 0:16:33,38
in a few years,

473
0:16:33,38 --> 0:16:33,98
even a decade or so,

474
0:16:33,98 --> 0:16:35,79
your thoughts will change.

475
0:16:35,79 --> 0:16:36,239
But no matter what,

476
0:16:36,239 --> 0:16:37,619
please find him.

477
0:16:37,619 --> 0:16:40,53
I once found this feeling while acting.

478
0:16:40,53 --> 0:16:42,53
I'm currently in the process of making videos and writing books.

479
0:16:42,53 --> 0:16:44,1
I need to gradually find this kind of feeling.

480
0:16:44,1 --> 0:16:47,53
I believe that every effort I make will benefit someone.

481
0:16:47,53 --> 0:16:51,73
Although I've simply been working on my own for these two and a half years,

482
0:16:51,73 --> 0:16:54,21
or more accurately, these two and a half years,

483
0:16:54,21 --> 0:16:55,73
or even from four years ago,

484
0:16:55,73 --> 0:16:58,61
since June 2020,

485
0:16:58,61 --> 0:17:1,26
I've been making short videos for these five years.

486
0:17:1,26 --> 0:17:4,3
I've basically never left my bedroom during this time.

487
0:17:4,3 --> 0:17:6,68
But to some extent,

488
0:17:6,68 --> 0:17:10,2
it differs from the physical distance in reality,

489
0:17:10,2 --> 0:17:10,94
How can I put it?

490
0:17:10,94 --> 0:17:14,3
it's because it can connect this room to everyone's bedroom,

491
0:17:14,3 --> 0:17:16,26
from one bedroom to another,

492
0:17:16,26 --> 0:17:18,53
from one heart to another,

493
0:17:18,53 --> 0:17:20,81
it has an amplifying effect,

494
0:17:20,81 --> 0:17:22,83
these things are incredibly meaningful,

495
0:17:22,83 --> 0:17:25,5
what truly matters in life is what has real significance.

496
0:17:25,5 --> 0:17:27,51
It's about being there to sleep alongside everyone.

497
0:17:27,51 --> 0:17:30,87
I can be by your side when you need help the most.

498
0:17:30,87 --> 0:17:32,83
This is the essence of the internet's existence.

499
0:17:32,83 --> 0:17:34,63
It's also why I've been lying low for so many years,

500
0:17:34,63 --> 0:17:35,59
Enduring so much hardship,

501
0:17:35,59 --> 0:17:36,63
The very reason for my existence.

502
0:17:36,63 --> 0:17:39,42
So I feel that the hardships endured for everyone's sake,

503
0:17:39,42 --> 0:17:40,46
The tempering of one's character,

504
0:17:40,46 --> 0:17:42,14
Cease to be hardships at all.

505
0:17:42,14 --> 0:17:46,679
Reading for the benefit of everyone

506
0:17:46,679 --> 0:17:48,399
and establishing certain values

507
0:17:48,399 --> 0:17:49,719
the values that are spread

508
0:17:49,719 --> 0:17:51,65
have a multiplier effect

509
0:17:51,65 --> 0:17:53,9
so when I read a book now

510
0:17:53,9 --> 0:17:54,85
it's as if everyone is reading it

511
0:17:54,85 --> 0:17:57,1
when I establish a good concept now

512
0:17:57,1 --> 0:17:58,85
I help everyone establish a good concept

513
0:17:58,85 --> 0:18:1,7
if I were to take advantage of others unfairly

514
0:18:1,7 --> 0:18:2,3
extremely selfish

515
0:18:2,3 --> 0:18:3,19
everyone will also follow my example

516
0:18:3,19 --> 0:18:5,35
so this creates a kind of

517
0:18:5,35 --> 0:18:7,89
it has a significant impact on me

518
0:18:7,89 --> 0:18:12,41
it requires being very cautious about one's words and actions

519
0:18:12,41 --> 0:18:14,57
when evaluating one's own behavior

520
0:18:14,57 --> 0:18:17,13
this is also part of being an internet celebrity

521
0:18:17,13 --> 0:18:18,639
an influencer's self-discipline

522
0:18:18,639 --> 0:18:19,719
in this regard

523
0:18:22,199 --> 0:18:23,839
When talking with comrades from the United Front Work Department,

524
0:18:23,839 --> 0:18:26,46
it's really a meeting of minds.

525
0:18:26,46 --> 0:18:27,54
Let me tell you,

526
0:18:27,54 --> 0:18:30,38
our country's internet regulators are actually quite humane.

527
0:18:30,38 --> 0:18:31,82
They often have heart-to-heart talks with you,

528
0:18:31,82 --> 0:18:34,34
and frequently sit down for deep conversations.

529
0:18:34,34 --> 0:18:35,389
They will try to advise you,

530
0:18:35,389 --> 0:18:37,89
of course, when it comes to many people,

531
0:18:37,89 --> 0:18:39,829
most internet celebrities are still primarily motivated by profit.

532
0:18:39,829 --> 0:18:40,949
It's more individualistic

533
0:18:40,949 --> 0:18:43,499
Although on the surface it seems very cooperative

534
0:18:43,499 --> 0:18:44,699
But in reality

535
0:18:44,699 --> 0:18:47,139
They don’t really take what others say to heart

536
0:18:47,139 --> 0:18:49,8
But Brother Rong takes these words truly to heart

537
0:18:49,8 --> 0:18:51,84
Because you have to have the people in your heart

538
0:18:51,84 --> 0:18:52,76
That's how it is

539
0:18:55,44 --> 0:18:57,27
That’s what I mean

540
0:18:57,27 --> 0:19:0,39
It’s about the span of your own life

541
0:19:0,39 --> 0:19:3,13
Your personal material enjoyment

542
0:19:3,13 --> 0:19:5,49
compared to the long-term interests of the people

543
0:19:5,49 --> 0:19:6,17
the interests of the nation

544
0:19:6,17 --> 0:19:6,77
the interests of the ethnic group

545
0:19:6,77 --> 0:19:10,29
the moral and progressive development of humanity

546
0:19:10,29 --> 0:19:12,55
the advancement of Earth's civilization

547
0:19:12,55 --> 0:19:14,53
is insignificant, right?

548
0:19:14,53 --> 0:19:19,47
and your personal gains and losses, loves and hates

549
0:19:19,47 --> 0:19:20,55
emotional reactions

550
0:19:20,55 --> 0:19:21,87
All sorts of things

551
0:19:21,87 --> 0:19:26,25
are insignificant compared to the evolution of the universe

552
0:19:26,25 --> 0:19:29,289
so this is not about self-sacrifice

553
0:19:29,289 --> 0:19:31,629
it's hard to put into words

554
0:19:31,629 --> 0:19:34,49
the grand meaning of life

555
0:19:34,49 --> 0:19:35,63
how you should live your life

556
0:19:35,63 --> 0:19:37,49
you should offer your small self

557
0:19:37,49 --> 0:19:38,43
to achieve the greater good

558
0:19:38,43 --> 0:19:41,699
this greater self is what we call the higher self

559
0:19:41,699 --> 0:19:42,579
What is greatness?

560
0:19:42,579 --> 0:19:44,559
I am one of the countless yous.

561
0:19:44,559 --> 0:19:46,379
Countless people just like you.

562
0:19:46,379 --> 0:19:48,21
Even though they may look different from you,

563
0:19:48,21 --> 0:19:49,61
Speak differently,

564
0:19:49,61 --> 0:19:50,69
Or have a different gender,

565
0:19:50,69 --> 0:19:53,19
They are, in essence, you.

566
0:19:53,19 --> 0:19:57,79
Why bring up this philosophical question today?

567
0:19:57,79 --> 0:19:58,99
To discuss it with everyone.

568
0:19:58,99 --> 0:20:0,74
What's the deal with this thing?

569
0:20:0,74 --> 0:20:4,16
Like, these are the rockets being launched now.

570
0:20:4,16 --> 0:20:6,13
These missiles.

571
0:20:6,13 --> 0:20:9,49
Whether it's the people in Israel or Iran.

572
0:20:9,49 --> 0:20:10,23
You have to see that.

573
0:20:10,23 --> 0:20:12,889
No matter what you say.

574
0:20:12,889 --> 0:20:14,129
Some people are digging their own graves.

575
0:20:14,129 --> 0:20:15,369
But you have to think about Israel.

576
0:20:15,369 --> 0:20:18,249
Not everyone supports Netanyahu, right?

577
0:20:18,249 --> 0:20:20,78
Not everyone is a restorationist, though.

578
0:20:20,78 --> 0:20:22,2
There are ordinary people as well.

579
0:20:22,2 --> 0:20:23,8
Right?

580
0:20:23,8 --> 0:20:24,78
Iran has ordinary people too.

581
0:20:24,78 --> 0:20:27,32
Every time a missile is launched,

582
0:20:27,32 --> 0:20:29,82
you'll find that many people don't distinguish between right and wrong.

583
0:20:29,82 --> 0:20:30,4
People,

584
0:20:30,4 --> 0:20:32,78
when they die, it's like the march of war chariots.

585
0:20:32,78 --> 0:20:34,4
It's like the Battle of Shi Hao.

586
0:20:34,4 --> 0:20:35,26
In a state of war

587
0:20:35,26 --> 0:20:37,36
many things are harsh

588
0:20:37,36 --> 0:20:39,24
there's no distinction between good and evil

589
0:20:39,24 --> 0:20:40,7
it's a calamity for humanity

590
0:20:40,7 --> 0:20:42,8
time is universal

591
0:20:42,8 --> 0:20:44,48
we can't say an earthquake in Japan is a good thing

592
0:20:44,48 --> 0:20:46,0
or a tsunami anywhere else

593
0:20:46,0 --> 0:20:46,88
is right

594
0:20:46,88 --> 0:20:51,75
you'll find that Chinese people have a deep sense of kindness

595
0:20:51,75 --> 0:20:53,37
and doesn't hold grudges

596
0:20:53,37 --> 0:20:55,29
but also thinks about revenge

597
0:20:55,29 --> 0:20:57,55
This is a mixed mindset

598
0:20:57,55 --> 0:20:58,82
Actually, it's quite good

599
0:20:58,82 --> 0:21:0,14
Chinese people have a good nature

600
0:21:0,14 --> 0:21:3,18
Look at who treated prisoners of war and their children well

601
0:21:3,18 --> 0:21:4,96
It's the Chinese who did the best

602
0:21:4,96 --> 0:21:8,65
Because we Chinese know our own hardships

603
0:21:8,65 --> 0:21:9,75
We extend kindness to others

604
0:21:9,75 --> 0:21:11,37
It's hard to know others' suffering

605
0:21:11,37 --> 0:21:13,79
I mean, most of the time

606
0:21:13,79 --> 0:21:15,21
we see many people bring it upon themselves

607
0:21:15,21 --> 0:21:17,49
but after they do

608
0:21:17,49 --> 0:21:19,609
when you really see women and children bleeding

609
0:21:19,609 --> 0:21:23,23
when you really see soldiers on the front lines of the Russia-Ukraine war

610
0:21:23,23 --> 0:21:24,57
in those moments of separation and death

611
0:21:24,57 --> 0:21:26,389
you still feel sad

612
0:21:26,389 --> 0:21:27,589
it still feels different

613
0:21:27,589 --> 0:21:29,769
So this is what they call humanity.

614
0:21:29,769 --> 0:21:31,509
The existence of conscience.

615
0:21:31,509 --> 0:21:32,489
Conscience.

616
0:21:32,489 --> 0:21:36,65
Many things, these things, are considered the most precious.

617
0:21:36,65 --> 0:21:37,21
This aspect.

618
0:21:37,21 --> 0:21:37,89
I believe,

619
0:21:37,89 --> 0:21:39,31
the reason we are now,

620
0:21:39,31 --> 0:21:42,4
able to be one of the important forces for peace on Earth,

621
0:21:42,4 --> 0:21:46,58
lies in our profound understanding of human nature.

622
0:21:46,58 --> 0:21:49,14
This kind of tolerance for people's suffering

623
0:21:49,14 --> 0:21:50,58
This kind of reflection

624
0:21:50,58 --> 0:21:52,28
How should I put it

625
0:21:52,28 --> 0:21:54,32
Being able to consider things from others' perspectives

626
0:21:54,32 --> 0:21:56,889
Rather than being like many people

627
0:21:56,889 --> 0:21:59,529
Who have this mindset of racial differences

628
0:21:59,529 --> 0:22:1,489
Or rather, this kind of prejudice

629
0:22:1,489 --> 0:22:2,88
Your way of thinking

630
0:22:2,88 --> 0:22:3,6
Of course

631
0:22:3,6 --> 0:22:6,34
We say that people with a conscience around the world

632
0:22:6,34 --> 0:22:7,4
Actually

633
0:22:7,4 --> 0:22:7,92
regardless of their nationality

634
0:22:7,92 --> 0:22:8,82
ethnicity

635
0:22:8,82 --> 0:22:11,48
or cultural and linguistic background

636
0:22:11,48 --> 0:22:13,76
we all share a common connection

637
0:22:13,76 --> 0:22:17,0
Good people admire and respect each other

638
0:22:17,0 --> 0:22:18,0
which is different

639
0:22:18,0 --> 0:22:20,88
while bad people engage in power struggles with one another

640
0:22:20,88 --> 0:22:23,32
This is the ultimate choice between good and evil.

641
0:22:23,32 --> 0:22:26,74
You'll find that all the good people in the world,

642
0:22:26,74 --> 0:22:29,86
in the end, no matter what, will put down their weapons,

643
0:22:29,86 --> 0:22:31,6
lay aside their prejudices,

644
0:22:31,6 --> 0:22:32,71
and unite together.

645
0:22:32,71 --> 0:22:36,1
But all the bad people have to go through power struggles.

646
0:22:36,1 --> 0:22:38,15
This is the ultimate test of good and evil.

647
0:22:38,15 --> 0:22:41,11
Because the bad people are self-centered,

648
0:22:41,11 --> 0:22:42,23
serving themselves.

649
0:22:42,23 --> 0:22:44,7
It's a place where only one person can exist.

650
0:22:44,7 --> 0:22:46,51
In the end, he must establish a hierarchy.

651
0:22:46,51 --> 0:22:48,13
This is the game of power.

652
0:22:48,13 --> 0:22:49,51
This is also feudalism.

653
0:22:49,51 --> 0:22:50,51
This is also religion.

654
0:22:50,51 --> 0:22:52,41
This is also the order of ancient times.

655
0:22:52,41 --> 0:22:54,18
There must be a hierarchy.

656
0:22:54,255 --> 0:22:56,5
But good people don’t have a hierarchy.

657
0:22:56,5 --> 0:22:57,94
Good people don’t have boundaries.

658
0:22:57,94 --> 0:22:59,9
So, when it comes to being a good person

659
0:22:59,9 --> 0:23:1,3
the cost of being a bad person

660
0:23:1,3 --> 0:23:4,66
the initial cost of being a good person is quite high

661
0:23:4,66 --> 0:23:6,7
the price of persistent goodness is also significant

662
0:23:6,7 --> 0:23:8,1
you also need to distinguish between overly nice people

663
0:23:8,1 --> 0:23:9,52
and foolish people

664
0:23:9,52 --> 0:23:12,1
and those who take advantage of you

665
0:23:12,1 --> 0:23:14,28
if you don't go through these rounds of tests

666
0:23:14,28 --> 0:23:16,1
if you don't experience being wronged

667
0:23:16,1 --> 0:23:17,42
Without being wronged,

668
0:23:17,42 --> 0:23:18,26
or being falsely accused,

669
0:23:18,26 --> 0:23:19,76
you don't deserve to be a good person.

670
0:23:19,76 --> 0:23:22,11
Your kindness isn't steadfast.

671
0:23:22,11 --> 0:23:23,63
When you act as a bad person,

672
0:23:23,63 --> 0:23:24,99
you might also consider acting badly,

673
0:23:24,99 --> 0:23:26,47
starting to take what isn't yours by any means,

674
0:23:26,47 --> 0:23:27,23
being selfish and self-centered,

675
0:23:27,23 --> 0:23:29,2
feeling particularly satisfied when taking advantage of others.

676
0:23:29,2 --> 0:23:31,18
But later on, you'll realize

677
0:23:31,18 --> 0:23:32,5
no matter where you are, there will be people with more power,

678
0:23:32,5 --> 0:23:34,72
more wealth, and higher prestige than you.

679
0:23:34,72 --> 0:23:36,69
You must be the little fish that eats the big fish,

680
0:23:36,69 --> 0:23:38,17
not the big fish that eats the little fish,

681
0:23:38,17 --> 0:23:39,9
but the little fish that eats the big fish.

682
0:23:39,9 --> 0:23:42,62
So, the prerequisite for being the little fish that eats the big fish is that you have to eat other little fish first.

683
0:23:42,62 --> 0:23:44,7
You need to eliminate many fish that are just like you,

684
0:23:44,7 --> 0:23:47,7
and you must bully those who are weaker than you.

685
0:23:47,7 --> 0:23:47,91
That's how it is.

686
0:23:47,91 --> 0:23:49,29
You must take advantage of the weak.

687
0:23:49,29 --> 0:23:53,2
Only then can you finally eat the other medium-sized fish.

688
0:23:53,2 --> 0:23:54,2
Only then can you become a big fish.

689
0:23:54,2 --> 0:23:55,5
Only then can you ultimately eliminate everything.

690
0:23:55,5 --> 0:23:57,96
In the end, you'll find that if there aren't bodies lying around,

691
0:23:57,96 --> 0:23:59,2
then the one lying down will be you.

692
0:23:59,2 --> 0:24:0,679
So this is the path of the villain.

693
0:24:0,679 --> 0:24:2,839
On the path of the villain, you have to be the prettiest of all.

694
0:24:2,839 --> 0:24:3,799
Who's the wisest

695
0:24:3,799 --> 0:24:4,839
Who's the most capable

696
0:24:4,839 --> 0:24:5,679
Who's got what

697
0:24:5,679 --> 0:24:7,44
Your lifespan is limited anyway

698
0:24:7,44 --> 0:24:8,54
So let me tell you

699
0:24:8,54 --> 0:24:10,8
In this world

700
0:24:10,8 --> 0:24:10,84
Being good

701
0:24:10,84 --> 0:24:12,22
Being bad, both come with a price

702
0:24:12,22 --> 0:24:14,159
Being purely good

703
0:24:14,159 --> 0:24:16,179
It's hard to find purely evil people

704
0:24:16,179 --> 0:24:18,239
Most people are a mix of improvisation

705
0:24:18,239 --> 0:24:20,639
Most people are neither good nor bad, really.

706
0:24:20,639 --> 0:24:22,81
Sometimes, one's conscience kicks in.

707
0:24:22,81 --> 0:24:24,21
I've witnessed a human tragedy.

708
0:24:24,21 --> 0:24:26,7
I saw the promotion saying that.

709
0:24:26,7 --> 0:24:27,39
He got better.

710
0:24:27,39 --> 0:24:31,55
Sometimes, we encounter issues of interest distribution in reality.

711
0:24:31,55 --> 0:24:32,73
Feeling annoyed again

712
0:24:32,73 --> 0:24:36,139
Then again, I have to play the bad guy for a few days.

713
0:24:36,139 --> 0:24:37,559
When disaster strikes,

714
0:24:37,559 --> 0:24:39,259
I go to the temple to burn incense,

715
0:24:39,259 --> 0:24:40,379
to pray and worship the gods,

716
0:24:40,379 --> 0:24:41,599
bowing my head like a pestle pounding garlic.

717
0:24:41,599 --> 0:24:43,599
When I’m feeling on top of the world,

718
0:24:43,599 --> 0:24:45,34
I take pleasure in killing,

719
0:24:45,34 --> 0:24:46,48
and indulge in my harem,

720
0:24:46,48 --> 0:24:47,82
today I want to get rid of this one.

721
0:24:47,82 --> 0:24:50,62
Tomorrow, think about the day after, and the day after that, it’s all about people.

722
0:24:50,62 --> 0:24:52,1
It’s about challenging humanity.

723
0:24:52,1 --> 0:24:54,28
It’s actually a very complex matter.

724
0:24:54,28 --> 0:24:56,4
So, I still recommend that everyone

725
0:24:56,4 --> 0:24:58,48
if you can spare 10% of your time,

726
0:24:58,48 --> 0:25:0,78
5% of your wealth,

727
0:25:0,78 --> 0:25:3,0
then give back to society.

728
0:25:3,0 --> 0:25:5,54
There are many ways to give back to society.

729
0:25:5,54 --> 0:25:7,389
I believe that being poor and being impoverished are different.

730
0:25:7,389 --> 0:25:8,769
Being poor means having no money

731
0:25:8,769 --> 0:25:12,189
Being destitute means having absolutely no ability to earn money

732
0:25:12,189 --> 0:25:14,56
It could be due to a disability from labor

733
0:25:14,56 --> 0:25:16,46
Or it could be due to a congenital illness

734
0:25:16,46 --> 0:25:18,44
There are many pitiable people in this world

735
0:25:18,44 --> 0:25:22,19
They can't move freely between good and evil like we do

736
0:25:22,19 --> 0:25:24,49
Or choose their own way of life

737
0:25:24,49 --> 0:25:27,55
Or escape from economic hardships

738
0:25:27,55 --> 0:25:28,27
In this world

739
0:25:28,27 --> 0:25:29,62
Many people might say

740
0:25:29,62 --> 0:25:32,26
that our so-called first incarnation in this world

741
0:25:32,26 --> 0:25:33,82
has been filled with so much pain

742
0:25:33,82 --> 0:25:36,1
its initial settings are quite challenging

743
0:25:36,1 --> 0:25:39,26
so as an experienced veteran player

744
0:25:39,26 --> 0:25:40,7
you need to help them

745
0:25:40,7 --> 0:25:42,1
this is a crucial moment

746
0:25:42,1 --> 0:25:43,96
so in your life

747
0:25:43,96 --> 0:25:46,66
spend some time volunteering

748
0:25:46,66 --> 0:25:48,81
This thing is actually very meaningful.

749
0:25:48,81 --> 0:25:51,1
Like myself, I've been a volunteer for two years.

750
0:25:51,1 --> 0:25:52,69
I was very happy when I was a volunteer.

751
0:25:52,69 --> 0:25:54,4
You don't earn money,

752
0:25:54,4 --> 0:25:55,42
but you are happy.

753
0:25:55,42 --> 0:25:57,58
Because you find the meaning in your life.

754
0:25:57,58 --> 0:25:59,16
Life itself has no inherent meaning,

755
0:25:59,16 --> 0:26:0,48
but you discover meaning.

756
0:26:0,48 --> 0:26:2,27
This makes it incredibly meaningful.

757
0:26:2,27 --> 0:26:4,57
This is one of our joys.

758
0:26:4,57 --> 0:26:7,13
So, no matter how society changes,

759
0:26:7,13 --> 0:26:9,57
Every day you have to take in a lot of information,

760
0:26:9,57 --> 0:26:10,71
How to make money,

761
0:26:10,71 --> 0:26:12,89
How to make friends,

762
0:26:12,89 --> 0:26:14,69
How to handle your career,

763
0:26:14,69 --> 0:26:17,75
What medicine to take for what illness,

764
0:26:17,75 --> 0:26:19,57
How to lose weight,

765
0:26:19,57 --> 0:26:20,85
How to protect your liver.

766
0:26:20,85 --> 0:26:21,85
How to take care of your skin

767
0:26:21,85 --> 0:26:23,87
You'll be bombarded with a lot of information

768
0:26:23,87 --> 0:26:25,929
You might find that for your own survival

769
0:26:25,929 --> 0:26:27,849
Sometimes you're already giving it your all

770
0:26:27,849 --> 0:26:28,729
At this point

771
0:26:28,729 --> 0:26:30,119
You might realize

772
0:26:30,119 --> 0:26:32,659
Besides needing these worldly things

773
0:26:32,659 --> 0:26:34,779
These materialistic things

774
0:26:34,779 --> 0:26:38,11
You also need to seek out something eternal

775
0:26:38,11 --> 0:26:39,79
When it comes to eternal things

776
0:26:39,79 --> 0:26:41,639
Like what Rong often talks about

777
0:26:41,639 --> 0:26:43,399
I discuss worldly matters

778
0:26:43,399 --> 0:26:44,279
Eternal things

779
0:26:44,279 --> 0:26:45,479
As for today’s episode

780
0:26:45,479 --> 0:26:46,639
I’ve talked so much

781
0:26:46,639 --> 0:26:48,319
Also to tell you about eternal things

782
0:26:48,319 --> 0:26:49,49
The principles behind them

783
0:26:49,49 --> 0:26:51,77
When you establish some eternal beliefs

784
0:26:51,77 --> 0:26:54,1
When it belongs to the beliefs of lifetimes

785
0:26:54,1 --> 0:26:55,17
it follows your consciousness

786
0:26:55,17 --> 0:26:57,57
it delves deep into the depths of your consciousness

787
0:26:57,57 --> 0:26:59,79
it conducts profound explorations

788
0:26:59,79 --> 0:27:0,93
so in many cases

789
0:27:0,93 --> 0:27:2,33
you need to cultivate your focus

790
0:27:2,33 --> 0:27:3,69
you can try meditation

791
0:27:3,69 --> 0:27:5,26
you can try physical exercise

792
0:27:5,26 --> 0:27:6,82
this is a crucial time

793
0:27:6,82 --> 0:27:9,66
you have a robust body

794
0:27:9,66 --> 0:27:11,6
a strong mental power

795
0:27:11,6 --> 0:27:13,29
it sustains your physical form

796
0:27:13,29 --> 0:27:15,13
your consciousness does not perish

797
0:27:15,13 --> 0:27:16,1
so no matter what

798
0:27:16,1 --> 0:27:18,1
a person cannot stop thinking

799
0:27:18,1 --> 0:27:19,99
sometimes you might

800
0:27:19,99 --> 0:27:23,25
due to illness, enter a prolonged state of thought

801
0:27:23,25 --> 0:27:25,29
you'll find that life's stages are like peaks and valleys

802
0:27:25,29 --> 0:27:25,85
they pass by like this

803
0:27:25,85 --> 0:27:26,87
so this kind of thing, which belongs to the brave

804
0:27:26,87 --> 0:27:29,79
you need to invest in it

805
0:27:29,79 --> 0:27:31,389
the time spent on my videos

806
0:27:31,389 --> 0:27:33,869
is an investment

807
0:27:33,869 --> 0:27:35,59
essentially speaking

808
0:27:35,99 --> 0:27:36,91
what I discuss with you today

809
0:27:36,91 --> 0:27:38,59
might be the meaning of life

810
0:27:38,59 --> 0:27:39,75
might be a philosophy of living

811
0:27:39,75 --> 0:27:41,17
might be the ultimate choice between good and evil

812
0:27:41,17 --> 0:27:42,98
or it might be nothing at all

813
0:27:42,98 --> 0:27:44,12
it might have no practical significance

814
0:27:44,12 --> 0:27:45,5
but when I feel the need to talk about these things

815
0:27:45,5 --> 0:27:48,15
I will definitely talk about them

816
0:27:48,15 --> 0:27:49,11
because once they are released

817
0:27:49,11 --> 0:27:50,45
you never know

818
0:27:50,45 --> 0:27:51,87
who they will touch in life

819
0:27:51,87 --> 0:27:54,19
who they will ripple in destiny

820
0:27:54,19 --> 0:27:56,49
that's how it is

821
0:27:56,49 --> 0:27:57,97
so in your life

822
0:27:57,97 --> 0:27:59,71
what you do may seem meaningless

823
0:27:59,71 --> 0:28:2,56
or it may seem spontaneous

824
0:28:2,56 --> 0:28:5,44
you don't need to delve into the reasons

825
0:28:5,44 --> 0:28:8,5
when you decide to do something

826
0:28:8,5 --> 0:28:11,659
you never know where it will ultimately spread

827
0:28:11,659 --> 0:28:15,259
you create a video

828
0:28:15,259 --> 0:28:16,659
you never know if you will ultimately help others

829
0:28:16,659 --> 0:28:19,8
where it will spread

830
0:28:19,8 --> 0:28:20,96
what impact it will have on others

831
0:28:20,96 --> 0:28:22,76
you won't know

832
0:28:22,76 --> 0:28:23,98
so just leave it to the void

833
0:28:23,98 --> 0:28:26,24
or leave it to nature

834
0:28:26,24 --> 0:28:28,8
leave it to the universe

835
0:28:28,8 --> 0:28:29,17
leave it to the balance of yin and yang

836
0:28:29,17 --> 0:28:30,69
leave it to the cause and effect

837
0:28:30,69 --> 0:28:32,53
that's enough

838
0:28:32,53 --> 0:28:33,389
but when you work for the universe

839
0:28:33,389 --> 0:28:35,649
while working

840
0:28:35,649 --> 0:28:36,669
you maintain a positive mindset

841
0:28:36,669 --> 0:28:38,129
having a good intention is enough

842
0:28:38,129 --> 0:28:40,51
so many times what we do

843
0:28:40,51 --> 0:28:43,31
the choices we make in life

844
0:28:43,31 --> 0:28:44,85
as long as your belief is right

845
0:28:44,85 --> 0:28:46,88
you don't need to worry about the actual outcome

846
0:28:46,88 --> 0:28:48,92
you won't be the observer of the results

847
0:28:48,92 --> 0:28:51,76
but you are the one who plants the seeds of cause and effect

848
0:28:51,76 --> 0:28:55,0
when your cause and effect are good

849
0:28:55,0 --> 0:28:57,46
when you sow with tears

850
0:28:57,46 --> 0:29:0,0
there will surely be a day of harvest

851
0:29:0,0 --> 0:29:2,8
the one who reaps might not be you

852
0:29:2,8 --> 0:29:4,21
but you will definitely contribute to the universe

853
0:29:4,21 --> 0:29:7,59
definitely have a positive impact on the progress of human society

854
0:29:7,59 --> 0:29:10,93
this is the meaning of your existence

855
0:29:10,93 --> 0:29:12,52
for the progress of human society

856
0:29:12,52 --> 0:29:14,2
for the great unity of the world

857
0:29:14,2 --> 0:29:15,58
for the great solidarity of the world's people

858
0:29:15,58 --> 0:29:17,719
you are living a very meaningful life

859
0:29:17,719 --> 0:29:20,119
our bodies will eventually perish

860
0:29:20,119 --> 0:29:22,5
our wealth, power, and fame

861
0:29:22,5 --> 0:29:24,96
our mating rights

862
0:29:24,96 --> 0:29:26,6
all those fancy sports cars

863
0:29:26,6 --> 0:29:29,469
beautiful men and women will fade with youth

864
0:29:29,504 --> 0:29:33,19
with life, they will ultimately pass away

865
0:29:33,19 --> 0:29:35,21
the pain we bear will completely vanish

866
0:29:35,21 --> 0:29:38,25
as if we never existed in this world

867
0:29:38,25 --> 0:29:40,9
Completely vanished without a trace

868
0:29:40,9 --> 0:29:42,69
As if we had never been in this world

869
0:29:42,69 --> 0:29:44,71
But our impact on the world

870
0:29:44,71 --> 0:29:46,45
It has existed for all eternity.

871
0:29:46,45 --> 0:29:48,45
When you come back to this world next time

872
0:29:48,45 --> 0:29:51,12
You will also witness the fruits of your previous life's labor.
