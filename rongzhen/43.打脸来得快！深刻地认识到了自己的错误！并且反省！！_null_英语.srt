0:0:0,78 --> 0:0:1,8
Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,8 --> 0:0:4,38
It's 5:22 AM right now

3
0:0:4,38 --> 0:0:7,46
I sincerely apologize to everyone here

4
0:0:8,6 --> 0:0:13,36
Due to my lack of thorough fact-checking,

5
0:0:13,36 --> 0:0:16,61
I disregarded the public opinion

6
0:0:16,61 --> 0:0:19,45
And ended up going against the mainstream narrative

7
0:0:19,45 --> 0:0:23,18
And empathized with this guilty individual

8
0:0:23,18 --> 0:0:26,6
This person's actions

9
0:0:26,6 --> 0:0:27,86
What's often being spread around is

10
0:0:27,86 --> 0:0:31,53
stigmatizing many of our fellow citizens

11
0:0:31,53 --> 0:0:32,89
This is utterly excessive

12
0:0:32,89 --> 0:0:36,29
The school's punishment is entirely justified

13
0:0:36,29 --> 0:0:38,3
It's reasonable, effective, and measured

14
0:0:38,3 --> 0:0:41,6
The public's supervision and criticism of me

15
0:0:41,6 --> 0:0:43,2
has been extremely timely

16
0:0:43,2 --> 0:0:44,6
and very enthusiastic

17
0:0:44,6 --> 0:0:46,769
So, the video was taken down.

18
0:0:46,769 --> 0:0:49,169
And I want to sincerely apologize to everyone here.

19
0:0:49,169 --> 0:0:52,96
We, as content creators, should frequently self-examine and correct our mistakes.

20
0:0:52,96 --> 0:0:54,6
And we should be proactive in doing so.

21
0:0:54,6 --> 0:0:57,77
To align with the mainstream views of our audience.

22
0:0:57,77 --> 0:1:0,61
We shouldn't seek attention by being overly unconventional.

23
0:1:0,61 --> 0:1:2,53
That would be very inappropriate.

24
0:1:2,53 --> 0:1:4,41
I apologize sincerely to everyone here.

25
0:1:4,41 --> 0:1:5,88
I got a buzz cut today.
