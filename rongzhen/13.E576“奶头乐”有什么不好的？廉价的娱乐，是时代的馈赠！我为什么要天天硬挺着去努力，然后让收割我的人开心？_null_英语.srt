1
0:0:0,52 --> 0:0:3,56
There are always people telling you that indulging in leisure activities like this isn't good.

2
0:0:3,56 --> 0:0:7,99
Then you start to feel guilty about playing games or scrolling through short videos.

3
0:0:7,99 --> 0:0:9,61
You get a sense of shame.

4
0:0:9,61 --> 0:0:11,89
You feel it's a huge waste of time.

5
0:0:11,89 --> 0:0:13,7
But that's not the case at all.

6
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:17,48
In fact, these leisure activities are one of the greatest inventions of our time.

7
0:0:17,48 --> 0:0:18,16
You see,

8
0:0:18,16 --> 0:0:20,3
Look at me now, staying at home.

9
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:24,7
All of my entertainment gadgets aren't expensive at all.

10
0:0:24,7 --> 0:0:24,91
Including my car

11
0:0:24,91 --> 0:0:25,71
Including my motorcycle

12
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:27,57
Including all my gaming consoles, they're not expensive

13
0:0:27,57 --> 0:0:29,77
The sports model is over 3000, right?

14
0:0:29,77 --> 0:0:32,0
The PS5 is over 2000

15
0:0:32,0 --> 0:0:33,8
The Switch is around 1000

16
0:0:33,8 --> 0:0:35,46
And the TV is over 4000

17
0:0:35,46 --> 0:0:36,64
The computer, when added together

18
0:0:36,64 --> 0:0:38,8
The configuration back then was over 7000

19
0:0:38,8 --> 0:0:38,48
Right?

20
0:0:38,48 --> 0:0:39,75
you can still afford them

21
0:0:39,75 --> 0:0:42,67
so in our current era

22
0:0:42,67 --> 0:0:44,7
even if you don't play official games

23
0:0:44,7 --> 0:0:45,67
there are many games you can bundle up

24
0:0:45,67 --> 0:0:46,29
to enjoy to the fullest

25
0:0:46,29 --> 0:0:46,99
Right?

26
0:0:46,99 --> 0:0:48,71
so in this era

27
0:0:48,71 --> 0:0:51,73
you can spend the whole day watching Bilibili with the TV on

28
0:0:51,73 --> 0:0:53,61
Then you just scroll with joy

29
0:0:53,61 --> 0:0:56,49
Of course, hard work is crucial at times

30
0:0:56,49 --> 0:0:58,31
Like reading to improve yourself

31
0:0:58,31 --> 0:1:0,62
Learning self-discipline is important

32
0:1:0,62 --> 0:1:2,66
But to be honest

33
0:1:2,66 --> 0:1:6,1
The key to getting rich lies in seizing opportunities

34
0:1:6,1 --> 0:1:7,58
I mentioned to everyone the other day

35
0:1:7,58 --> 0:1:9,65
You can join me as a guest

36
0:1:9,65 --> 0:1:12,28
But many people just turn a deaf ear

37
0:1:12,28 --> 0:1:13,24
Just let it go

38
0:1:13,24 --> 0:1:14,16
But some people actually did it

39
0:1:14,16 --> 0:1:15,76
They quickly recorded over ten lessons for me

40
0:1:15,76 --> 0:1:17,12
And it went pretty well

41
0:1:17,12 --> 0:1:18,99
I immediately submitted it for Bilibili's review

42
0:1:18,99 --> 0:1:19,47
Right?

43
0:1:19,47 --> 0:1:22,2
This is a great start

44
0:1:22,2 --> 0:1:26,74
So the key is how you seize the opportunity

45
0:1:26,74 --> 0:1:30,47
But what about the rest of the time besides seizing opportunities?

46
0:1:30,47 --> 0:1:32,5
You should still conserve your energy.

47
0:1:32,5 --> 0:1:34,11
Many of these wealthy people tell you,

48
0:1:34,11 --> 0:1:35,87
how they maintain self-discipline,

49
0:1:35,87 --> 0:1:38,25
how their cognitive abilities are so high,

50
0:1:38,25 --> 0:1:40,55
but most of the time, they are just like you,

51
0:1:40,55 --> 0:1:42,7
they play games too,

52
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:43,38
they also entertain themselves,

53
0:1:43,38 --> 0:1:45,52
it’s just that their entertainment might differ from yours,

54
0:1:45,52 --> 0:1:47,98
it might have more social elements.

55
0:1:47,98 --> 0:1:49,18
It might be a bit stronger

56
0:1:49,18 --> 0:1:51,34
For instance, your entertainment might be playing billiards

57
0:1:51,34 --> 0:1:53,1
His entertainment might be playing golf

58
0:1:53,1 --> 0:1:55,31
It’s just that the people who play are different

59
0:1:55,31 --> 0:1:57,71
He might focus on some investment information

60
0:1:57,71 --> 0:1:59,87
You might listen to things related to your career

61
0:1:59,87 --> 0:2:0,99
So, to put it in perspective

62
0:2:0,99 --> 0:2:2,97
A lot of the time

63
0:2:2,97 --> 0:2:5,81
We choose different ways to relax

64
0:2:5,81 --> 0:2:7,41
But when it comes to nipple joy,

65
0:2:7,41 --> 0:2:9,9
it's the greatest invention of our time.

66
0:2:9,9 --> 0:2:11,98
You see, in the past,

67
0:2:11,98 --> 0:2:13,56
people sought entertainment,

68
0:2:13,56 --> 0:2:15,92
they looked for ways to cultivate their emotions,

69
0:2:15,92 --> 0:2:17,67
they wanted to relieve their stress,

70
0:2:17,67 --> 0:2:19,43
they could only read books,

71
0:2:19,43 --> 0:2:20,25
go on outings,

72
0:2:20,25 --> 0:2:21,51
take walks, or do other activities.

73
0:2:21,51 --> 0:2:22,39
Now, let's talk about this.

74
0:2:22,39 --> 0:2:24,29
You shouldn't stay at home all the time.

75
0:2:24,29 --> 0:2:26,63
Staying in a safe place is fine,

76
0:2:26,63 --> 0:2:31,23
where you can enjoy food delivered to your doorstep, right?

77
0:2:31,23 --> 0:2:33,27
And you can also call a car,

78
0:2:33,27 --> 0:2:34,35
even a luxury car,

79
0:2:34,35 --> 0:2:36,16
you can get a luxury car for over a hundred bucks,

80
0:2:36,16 --> 0:2:38,0
and have food delivered to your place,

81
0:2:38,0 --> 0:2:40,4
not just short videos.

82
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:43,4
Beautiful women from all over the world will dance for you

83
0:2:43,4 --> 0:2:44,8
And all these things

84
0:2:44,8 --> 0:2:46,44
Used to require reading books to acquire

85
0:2:46,44 --> 0:2:48,64
Now everyone can easily provide them to you

86
0:2:48,64 --> 0:2:51,8
They just give you an online course

87
0:2:51,8 --> 0:2:52,4
It’s all explained clearly

88
0:2:52,4 --> 0:2:53,84
Like Brother Rong as well

89
0:2:53,84 --> 0:2:56,19
This standard sociology

90
0:2:56,19 --> 0:2:56,95
Father

91
0:2:56,95 --> 0:3:0,59
Cyber Godfather is here to chat with you every night

92
0:3:0,59 --> 0:3:1,89
to lull you to sleep

93
0:3:1,89 --> 0:3:3,17
to ease your worries

94
0:3:3,17 --> 0:3:5,45
and this is the best thing about our time

95
0:3:5,45 --> 0:3:7,68
because he brings a lot of resources closer to you

96
0:3:7,68 --> 0:3:10,74
in ancient times, people didn't have so many resources

97
0:3:10,74 --> 0:3:13,71
you needed money to enjoy various entertainments

98
0:3:13,71 --> 0:3:15,39
like going to a theater to listen to a performance

99
0:3:15,39 --> 0:3:17,85
you had to spend a lot of money wherever you went

100
0:3:17,85 --> 0:3:21,54
Spending a lot of money might not even yield today's results.

101
0:3:21,54 --> 0:3:25,38
But to be honest, we should thank platforms like Pinduoduo today.

102
0:3:25,38 --> 0:3:27,7
It's not because I've taken ads from Pinduoduo.

103
0:3:27,7 --> 0:3:29,7
It's platforms like Pinduoduo that

104
0:3:29,7 --> 0:3:33,64
offer our industrial products to you at a very low cost.

105
0:3:33,64 --> 0:3:36,2
So, the existence of Pinduoduo and the like

106
0:3:36,2 --> 0:3:37,899
like JD, Taobao, and Pinduoduo,

107
0:3:37,899 --> 0:3:39,379
some sell at lower prices,

108
0:3:39,379 --> 0:3:40,219
while others sell at higher prices.

109
0:3:40,219 --> 0:3:42,299
Different people have different spending levels.

110
0:3:42,299 --> 0:3:44,539
But you know, you can get the same experience at a lower price.

111
0:3:44,539 --> 0:3:45,959
Isn't that right?

112
0:3:45,959 --> 0:3:47,3
And every time I shop on Douyin,

113
0:3:47,3 --> 0:3:49,6
If I don’t buy something right away,

114
0:3:49,6 --> 0:3:50,18
They quickly offer me a discount.

115
0:3:50,18 --> 0:3:51,28
Hehe, that’s how it is.

116
0:3:51,28 --> 0:3:52,55
So, in our era,

117
0:3:52,55 --> 0:3:54,43
So, let's talk about our era.

118
0:3:54,43 --> 0:3:56,19
We can use a very affordable amount of money

119
0:3:56,19 --> 0:3:58,54
We can use Pinduoduo or Pinduohao

120
0:3:58,54 --> 0:3:59,82
We might not be able to see it on Douyin

121
0:3:59,82 --> 0:4:0,98
We can watch Kuaishou

122
0:4:0,98 --> 0:4:1,62
If it's really not possible

123
0:4:1,62 --> 0:4:2,86
Or we can check out Alipay

124
0:4:2,86 --> 0:4:5,39
We can watch the video section on Pinduoduo

125
0:4:5,39 --> 0:4:7,78
There are many places where we can watch short videos

126
0:4:7,78 --> 0:4:9,58
There are many places where we can play games

127
0:4:9,58 --> 0:4:12,94
You might not be able to afford the console for a game.

128
0:4:12,94 --> 0:4:13,82
You might not be able to afford a computer either.

129
0:4:13,82 --> 0:4:15,97
But there are mobile versions available.

130
0:4:15,97 --> 0:4:17,63
And in many cases,

131
0:4:17,63 --> 0:4:19,7
if you don't want to pay for the official version,

132
0:4:19,7 --> 0:4:20,75
even though the official versions are quite affordable these days,

133
0:4:20,75 --> 0:4:22,73
many people still hesitate to spend the money.

134
0:4:22,73 --> 0:4:25,97
You can enjoy so much entertainment for a very small cost.

135
0:4:25,97 --> 0:4:27,57
This is actually a pretty amazing thing.

136
0:4:27,57 --> 0:4:30,609
And we can enjoy a variety of vegetables with just a little money.

137
0:4:30,609 --> 0:4:31,489
We can even afford meat.

138
0:4:31,489 --> 0:4:34,129
This is something that some countries simply can't achieve.

139
0:4:34,129 --> 0:4:38,1
Our agricultural product prices are incredibly low and affordable.

140
0:4:38,1 --> 0:4:38,69
To be precise,

141
0:4:38,69 --> 0:4:41,81
this allows you to use a minimal amount of money

142
0:4:41,81 --> 0:4:43,67
to acquire a relatively

143
0:4:43,67 --> 0:4:46,69
comparatively high standard of living.

144
0:4:46,69 --> 0:4:47,83
And if you understand this,

145
0:4:47,83 --> 0:4:50,99
The difference between you and the rich isn't that big.

146
0:4:50,99 --> 0:4:52,33
They buy luxury cars,

147
0:4:52,33 --> 0:4:52,97
drive luxury cars,

148
0:4:52,97 --> 0:4:55,4
but you can directly ride in luxury cars.

149
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:58,18
They live in spacious penthouses in large mansions,

150
0:4:58,18 --> 0:5:1,6
but you can also experience staying in homestays or luxury hotels.

151
0:5:1,6 --> 0:5:2,95
You can also enjoy it,

152
0:5:2,95 --> 0:5:4,43
living in luxury every day can get boring too,

153
0:5:4,43 --> 0:5:6,11
they enjoy luxury cars and beautiful women.

154
0:5:6,11 --> 0:5:6,75
Is that right?

155
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:9,59
He’s got a lot of women around him, and it cost him a fortune.

156
0:5:9,59 --> 0:5:10,65
Should we set up a booth?

157
0:5:10,65 --> 0:5:11,79
Now, to be honest,

158
0:5:11,79 --> 0:5:15,159
You can get almost the same experience at a much cheaper price.

159
0:5:15,159 --> 0:5:17,919
It’s just that someone is doing it for him.

160
0:5:17,919 --> 0:5:18,819
You’re doing it yourself.

161
0:5:18,819 --> 0:5:20,279
That’s the only difference.

162
0:5:20,279 --> 0:5:21,719
So, in many cases,

163
0:5:21,719 --> 0:5:23,79
We're talking about the present era.

164
0:5:23,79 --> 0:5:24,91
I've enjoyed something

165
0:5:24,91 --> 0:5:27,19
that even ancient emperors couldn't experience.

166
0:5:27,19 --> 0:5:28,57
Like online shopping,

167
0:5:28,57 --> 0:5:29,93
or having food delivered to your door,

168
0:5:29,93 --> 0:5:32,14
these things are actually great.

169
0:5:32,14 --> 0:5:34,3
Don't let some people dissuade you

170
0:5:34,3 --> 0:5:35,44
by saying that it's not good or something like that.

171
0:5:35,44 --> 0:5:36,24
You should be disciplined.

172
0:5:36,24 --> 0:5:38,58
Then you'll have to go back and read the books

173
0:5:38,58 --> 0:5:40,6
I actually read books too

174
0:5:40,6 --> 0:5:41,9
But I read them out of necessity

175
0:5:41,9 --> 0:5:43,96
I read because I need to learn

176
0:5:43,96 --> 0:5:45,22
As a knowledge influencer

177
0:5:45,22 --> 0:5:46,97
It's crucial to keep learning

178
0:5:46,97 --> 0:5:48,61
But as a consumer

179
0:5:48,61 --> 0:5:49,69
Why do you have to put yourself through so much stress

180
0:5:49,69 --> 0:5:51,659
Work is already exhausting enough

181
0:5:51,659 --> 0:5:52,339
Right?

182
0:5:52,339 --> 0:5:53,779
Going to school is tough too.

183
0:5:53,779 --> 0:5:54,899
I just want to have some fun.

184
0:5:54,899 --> 0:5:56,519
Is it wrong to use my phone for entertainment?

185
0:5:56,519 --> 0:5:58,199
I’m not hurting anyone else.

186
0:5:58,199 --> 0:5:58,97
Right?

187
0:5:58,97 --> 0:6:0,57
Why are some people in a hurry?

188
0:6:0,57 --> 0:6:3,68
It’s because you’re not contributing to society by doing so.

189
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:5,26
That’s why they’re anxious.

190
0:6:5,26 --> 0:6:6,84
So he’s going to manipulate you

191
0:6:6,84 --> 0:6:8,2
So he’s going to tell you

192
0:6:8,2 --> 0:6:9,12
You can’t do that

193
0:6:9,12 --> 0:6:10,2
You need to improve yourself

194
0:6:10,2 --> 0:6:10,48
Yeah

195
0:6:10,48 --> 0:6:11,8
You improve yourself

196
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:12,61
Your work efficiency gets higher

197
0:6:12,61 --> 0:6:13,97
Hey, you improve yourself

198
0:6:13,97 --> 0:6:15,81
Your work becomes more outstanding

199
0:6:15,81 --> 0:6:16,35
Right or wrong

200
0:6:16,35 --> 0:6:17,69
He's taking advantage

201
0:6:17,69 --> 0:6:19,5
As a worker

202
0:6:19,5 --> 0:6:20,49
You're trading time for money

203
0:6:20,49 --> 0:6:22,65
Why do you care so much about those things

204
0:6:22,65 --> 0:6:24,21
Actually, your youth is valuable in itself

205
0:6:24,21 --> 0:6:27,23
He's just buying your youth with money

206
0:6:27,23 --> 0:6:29,78
Of course, if we want to get rich

207
0:6:29,78 --> 0:6:30,78
We need to seize the right opportunities

208
0:6:30,78 --> 0:6:32,74
This opportunity isn't available to everyone.

209
0:6:32,74 --> 0:6:34,5
Many people can't recognize it.

210
0:6:34,5 --> 0:6:35,32
And he says,

211
0:6:35,32 --> 0:6:36,57
That's how fate works.

212
0:6:36,57 --> 0:6:37,97
It's just the way it is.

213
0:6:37,97 --> 0:6:39,24
Actually, personality is destiny.

214
0:6:39,24 --> 0:6:40,52
With such a lousy personality,

215
0:6:40,52 --> 0:6:42,2
You're bound to have a lousy destiny.

216
0:6:42,2 --> 0:6:43,32
There's no way to change that.

217
0:6:43,32 --> 0:6:44,72
And you don't recognize opportunities either.

218
0:6:44,72 --> 0:6:46,26
But I said it.

219
0:6:46,26 --> 0:6:47,87
Most people,

220
0:6:47,87 --> 0:6:52,63
the majority of ordinary folks can't all become bosses.

221
0:6:52,63 --> 0:6:57,399
ordinary people are content with a warm home and family.

222
0:6:57,399 --> 0:6:58,519
just a small piece of land to call their own.

223
0:6:58,519 --> 0:6:59,399
that's all there is to it.

224
0:6:59,399 --> 0:7:0,619
just staying warm and comfortable,

225
0:7:0,619 --> 0:7:1,819
just indulging in desires.

226
0:7:1,819 --> 0:7:2,839
That's all there is to it.

227
0:7:2,839 --> 0:7:4,7
There's no difference at all.

228
0:7:4,7 --> 0:7:6,64
This is the common crowd.

229
0:7:6,64 --> 0:7:9,6
Not everyone has to be an alpha male.

230
0:7:9,6 --> 0:7:10,3
Not everyone needs to engage in wordplay.

231
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:14,12
Not everyone has to talk about being at the top of the pyramid.

232
0:7:14,12 --> 0:7:15,7
Then defecate at the top.

233
0:7:15,7 --> 0:7:16,86
It's not like that.

234
0:7:16,86 --> 0:7:19,98
Not everyone is cut out to storm Chang'an and slay the hundred flowers.

235
0:7:19,98 --> 0:7:20,65
That's it.

236
0:7:20,65 --> 0:7:22,35
Otherwise, society would be in chaos.

237
0:7:22,35 --> 0:7:23,81
So, in this context,

238
0:7:23,81 --> 0:7:25,65
being a 'nipple' is a very normal thing.

239
0:7:25,65 --> 0:7:26,77
It can make us very happy.

240
0:7:26,77 --> 0:7:29,81
It can make many of our worries

241
0:7:29,81 --> 0:7:30,85
and troubles disappear.

242
0:7:30,85 --> 0:7:32,43
Actually, this is a good thing.

243
0:7:32,43 --> 0:7:34,33
Don't let those social media influencers,

244
0:7:34,33 --> 0:7:35,85
including myself,

245
0:7:35,85 --> 0:7:38,69
lead you into a lifestyle you dislike.

246
0:7:38,69 --> 0:7:42,26
If the way of life I advocate

247
0:7:42,26 --> 0:7:44,2
happens to be one you like,

248
0:7:44,2 --> 0:7:45,94
for example, I'm an ENTJ,

249
0:7:45,94 --> 0:7:48,2
I think everyone is lazy when I look at them.

250
0:7:48,2 --> 0:7:49,46
But are they really lazy?

251
0:7:49,46 --> 0:7:51,86
They might just be living at their own pace.

252
0:7:51,86 --> 0:7:53,42
If everyone were like me,

253
0:7:53,42 --> 0:7:55,12
we'd all be exhausted.

254
0:7:55,12 --> 0:7:55,56
You know,

255
0:7:55,56 --> 0:7:57,2
ambition every day,

256
0:7:57,2 --> 0:7:58,46
various kinds of revenge,

257
0:7:58,46 --> 0:8:0,74
figuring out how to make money,

258
0:8:0,74 --> 0:8:2,23
and gain power,

259
0:8:2,23 --> 0:8:3,39
that would be exhausting.

260
0:8:3,39 --> 0:8:4,39
That's the heart of an emperor.

261
0:8:4,39 --> 0:8:5,7
To be honest,

262
0:8:5,7 --> 0:8:7,23
it's better for everyone to be a commoner,

263
0:8:7,23 --> 0:8:8,72
to live a simple life.

264
0:8:8,72 --> 0:8:9,88
There's nothing wrong with that.

265
0:8:9,88 --> 0:8:11,82
Don't think buying a spinning top is a bad thing.

266
0:8:11,82 --> 0:8:13,18
I'm not being sarcastic.

267
0:8:13,18 --> 0:8:16,42
Because being happy is the most important task in life.
