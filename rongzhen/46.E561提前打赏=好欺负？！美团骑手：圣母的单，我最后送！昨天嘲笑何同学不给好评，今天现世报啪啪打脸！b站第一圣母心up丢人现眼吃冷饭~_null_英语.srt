1
0:0:0,68 --> 0:0:2,38
I'm just a big one

2
0:0:2,38 --> 0:0:3,8
Yeah, really

3
0:0:3,8 --> 0:0:6,32
Although the audience in front of the television might be thinking, 'Oh,'

4
0:0:6,32 --> 0:0:7,52
We felt the same way

5
0:0:7,52 --> 0:0:8,76
But why do you say that

6
0:0:8,76 --> 0:0:9,86
We want to hear it

7
0:0:9,86 --> 0:0:13,14
Actually, I didn't plan to update so quickly these past couple of days

8
0:0:13,14 --> 0:0:15,95
But then the video material came in.

9
0:0:15,95 --> 0:0:19,55
Do you remember the incident where He Xuefeng didn't give a good review

10
0:0:19,55 --> 0:0:21,5
At that moment, I thought

11
0:0:21,5 --> 0:0:23,82
Hey, Xiao He, you're getting a bit too cocky

12
0:0:23,82 --> 0:0:26,74
Have you made some money now?

13
0:0:26,74 --> 0:0:28,36
Becoming famous, huh?

14
0:0:28,36 --> 0:0:31,7
Starting to look down on the working class

15
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:33,33
Being so harsh on the workers

16
0:0:33,33 --> 0:0:35,41
It's just a good review, right?

17
0:0:35,41 --> 0:0:40,17
Isn't it just a small favor? Why are you being like this?

18
0:0:40,17 --> 0:0:43,59
Actually, I encountered a really unpleasant situation this time

19
0:0:43,59 --> 0:0:48,4
As you know, Brother Rong is such a saint, right?

20
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:48,9
Of course, speaking of that,

21
0:0:48,9 --> 0:0:52,9
This is related to the increasing secretion of estrogen.

22
0:0:52,9 --> 0:0:53,97
But Brother Rong has a saintly heart.

23
0:0:53,97 --> 0:0:55,25
And when I criticize others,

24
0:0:55,25 --> 0:0:59,48
I faced a test of my humanity today.

25
0:0:59,48 --> 0:1:4,789
A couple of days ago, I was drinking Kudi coffee from Pinyin Hao Fan,

26
0:1:4,789 --> 0:1:7,229
and the delivery guy brought me the wrong order.

27
0:1:7,229 --> 0:1:8,789
The delivery guy said he would compensate me.

28
0:1:8,789 --> 0:1:9,94
Compensate me ten bucks

29
0:1:9,94 --> 0:1:11,38
I said it’s fine

30
0:1:11,38 --> 0:1:12,54
Everyone’s having a tough time

31
0:1:12,54 --> 0:1:13,52
In this sweltering heat

32
0:1:13,52 --> 0:1:13,98
No worries

33
0:1:13,98 --> 0:1:14,74
Don’t take it to heart

34
0:1:14,74 --> 0:1:15,9
I’ve got your back, bro

35
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:17,8
Ordered another drink

36
0:1:17,8 --> 0:1:19,6
But I’m feeling really down

37
0:1:19,6 --> 0:1:21,56
I'll give the seller a bad review

38
0:1:21,56 --> 0:1:22,92
I'll give the delivery guy a good review

39
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:24,16
It doesn't really matter

40
0:1:24,16 --> 0:1:25,6
The next day

41
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:27,38
I ordered a steak

42
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:28,64
I was eating and chewing the steak

43
0:1:28,64 --> 0:1:32,63
At that time, there were still 15 minutes before closing

44
0:1:32,63 --> 0:1:35,1
So I felt really bad about it

45
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:39,16
But the seller managed to prepare my meal within 2 minutes

46
0:1:39,16 --> 0:1:41,52
I was really a bit hesitant to eat that meal.

47
0:1:41,52 --> 0:1:43,0
I was genuinely afraid he might spit in my food.

48
0:1:43,0 --> 0:1:44,54
But I still ate it, yeah.

49
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:45,68
It was actually pretty good.

50
0:1:45,68 --> 0:1:48,8
But afterwards, since I thought it was the last order of the night,

51
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:51,32
I tipped the delivery guy ten bucks.

52
0:1:51,32 --> 0:1:53,12
That’s how the story began.

53
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:54,76
The delivery guy was really happy.

54
0:1:54,76 --> 0:1:56,88
And I felt quite satisfied with it.

55
0:1:56,88 --> 0:2:0,4
Then I also posted on my WeChat Moments and Bilibili feed.

56
0:2:0,4 --> 0:2:0,92
Why?

57
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:5,12
Because I want everyone to know that I, Rong Zhen, am a good person.

58
0:2:5,12 --> 0:2:6,78
I'm so awesome.

59
0:2:6,78 --> 0:2:9,45
Look, I have ten yuan.

60
0:2:9,45 --> 0:2:10,81
I am a good person.

61
0:2:10,81 --> 0:2:12,39
I sympathize with the proletariat.

62
0:2:12,39 --> 0:2:13,77
I sympathize with the workers.

63
0:2:13,77 --> 0:2:14,77
I'm awesome.

64
0:2:14,77 --> 0:2:16,42
I may be a capitalist,

65
0:2:16,42 --> 0:2:19,78
but I can connect with the workers on a personal level.

66
0:2:19,78 --> 0:2:21,38
I'm such a good person,

67
0:2:21,38 --> 0:2:23,66
right? And I have a strong moral compass too.

68
0:2:23,66 --> 0:2:27,19
Not to mention, I'm pretty good-looking.

69
0:2:27,19 --> 0:2:28,75
But let me take that last statement back.

70
0:2:28,75 --> 0:2:29,37
It doesn't matter.

71
0:2:29,37 --> 0:2:32,23
Anyway, I think I'm really amazing,

72
0:2:32,23 --> 0:2:32,99
really amazing.

73
0:2:32,99 --> 0:2:34,27
I'm a really great person

74
0:2:34,27 --> 0:2:35,67
I'm a hundred times better than Xiao He

75
0:2:35,67 --> 0:2:36,11
Did you know?

76
0:2:36,11 --> 0:2:37,17
Although the number of followers isn't high

77
0:2:37,17 --> 0:2:37,99
I don't earn as much money as others

78
0:2:37,99 --> 0:2:39,27
I don't have the same level of talent

79
0:2:39,27 --> 0:2:40,7
No one is younger

80
0:2:40,7 --> 0:2:41,17
No one is more talented

81
0:2:41,17 --> 0:2:43,81
But I'm a good person

82
0:2:43,81 --> 0:2:44,53
Did you know?

83
0:2:44,53 --> 0:2:48,1
So today, I ordered another meal.

84
0:2:48,17 --> 0:2:50,49
I think someone as nice as me

85
0:2:50,49 --> 0:2:53,25
should be praised every day.

86
0:2:53,25 --> 0:2:55,27
And today, the heavens gave me a compliment.

87
0:2:55,27 --> 0:2:55,94
Did you know?

88
0:2:55,94 --> 0:2:57,72
What they mean by 'kindness doesn't lead troops'

89
0:2:57,72 --> 0:2:58,68
and 'righteousness doesn't accumulate wealth'

90
0:2:58,68 --> 0:3:0,86
is that petty people fear power but not virtue.

91
0:3:0,86 --> 0:3:2,149
I finally got it today.

92
0:3:2,149 --> 0:3:4,349
I gave the delivery guy a tip of ten bucks right away.

93
0:3:4,349 --> 0:3:8,17
It was for one of those Meituan delivery guys.

94
0:3:8,17 --> 0:3:15,91
Then my order didn't arrive for an hour.

95
0:3:15,91 --> 0:3:18,29
So I messaged the guy to ask.

96
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:22,37
I said, 'Dude, is it because I tipped you that you’re delivering my order last?'

97
0:3:22,37 --> 0:3:23,97
So, the last order you delivered to me

98
0:3:23,97 --> 0:3:25,66
The guy said it would be there soon, at the time.

99
0:3:28,24 --> 0:3:29,38
The guy has arrived.

100
0:3:29,38 --> 0:3:31,44
I see the food is wrapped up really cleanly.

101
0:3:31,44 --> 0:3:33,2
I'm a bit hesitant to eat it, though.

102
0:3:33,2 --> 0:3:35,18
Really, this is so saintly.

103
0:3:35,18 --> 0:3:36,54
Of course, let's talk about it.

104
0:3:36,54 --> 0:3:38,47
Brother Rong, let's keep things separate.

105
0:3:38,47 --> 0:3:40,45
Since I don't know what's going on,

106
0:3:40,45 --> 0:3:43,17
It might be because he thinks I'm easy to push around.

107
0:3:43,17 --> 0:3:45,97
So you see, it's still quite saintly.

108
0:3:45,97 --> 0:3:48,81
So, it was a bit late in sending it.

109
0:3:48,81 --> 0:3:51,1
There might really be an issue.

110
0:3:51,1 --> 0:3:54,72
The guy said the system assigned him too many orders.

111
0:3:54,72 --> 0:3:56,44
Of course, there’s not much that can be done about it.

112
0:3:56,44 --> 0:3:57,44
The system assigns too many orders.

113
0:3:57,44 --> 0:3:58,8
That’s pretty normal.

114
0:3:58,8 --> 0:3:58,74
Right?

115
0:3:58,74 --> 0:4:2,84
So, I won’t tip in advance next time.

116
0:4:2,84 --> 0:4:5,34
Of course, I blocked this guy.

117
0:4:5,34 --> 0:4:7,12
Of course, I didn't give a bad review

118
0:4:7,12 --> 0:4:8,24
nor did I make a complaint

119
0:4:8,24 --> 0:4:9,28
I just blocked them

120
0:4:9,28 --> 0:4:10,96
so you don't have to deliver to me next time

121
0:4:10,96 --> 0:4:13,51
I won't get into that hassle again, right?

122
0:4:13,51 --> 0:4:15,37
When it comes to hot weather

123
0:4:15,37 --> 0:4:17,43
I always give the delivery person a cold drink

124
0:4:17,43 --> 0:4:19,31
and this time was no different

125
0:4:19,31 --> 0:4:22,19
I gave the delivery person a cold drink as well

126
0:4:22,19 --> 0:4:25,759
And that's when my idealistic views were shattered.

127
0:4:25,759 --> 0:4:28,6
I often criticize others, saying

128
0:4:28,6 --> 0:4:30,36
you don't show compassion to the working class,

129
0:4:30,36 --> 0:4:32,36
you're all so cruel.

130
0:4:32,36 --> 0:4:33,76
You are quite cruel.

131
0:4:33,76 --> 0:4:36,64
But the truth is, human nature is complex.

132
0:4:36,64 --> 0:4:39,4
There are indeed people like Pangdonglai who reward others generously.

133
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:42,26
And there are those who treat the working class well.

134
0:4:42,26 --> 0:4:45,8
But you have to understand, in real life,

135
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:46,8
Often, when we talk about it

136
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:49,1
it's a good opportunity to show kindness

137
0:4:49,1 --> 0:4:53,37
The issue isn't that being nice is always wrong

138
0:4:53,37 --> 0:4:54,91
But in many situations

139
0:4:54,91 --> 0:4:57,8
for example, if you're too polite to the renovation worker

140
0:4:57,8 --> 0:5:0,18
they might not do a good job for you

141
0:5:0,18 --> 0:5:2,12
because they think you, a college student, are easy to talk to

142
0:5:2,12 --> 0:5:3,96
In real life, sometimes

143
0:5:3,96 --> 0:5:6,24
why do many people have a tough guy look

144
0:5:6,24 --> 0:5:8,2
All of them have a face that doesn't invite bullying

145
0:5:8,2 --> 0:5:9,97
It's because they've been bullied too often

146
0:5:9,97 --> 0:5:11,7
You're kind-hearted

147
0:5:11,7 --> 0:5:12,41
Whoever hands you a flyer

148
0:5:12,41 --> 0:5:13,25
You always take it

149
0:5:13,25 --> 0:5:15,58
Then they'll ask to add you on WeChat

150
0:5:15,58 --> 0:5:16,48
You're kind-hearted

151
0:5:16,48 --> 0:5:18,2
Everyone will come to you for money

152
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:18,64
And you always lend it

153
0:5:18,64 --> 0:5:19,82
In the end, you won't be able to pay back the money.

154
0:5:19,82 --> 0:5:21,1
After you get into trouble yourself,

155
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:23,38
no one will have any sympathy for you.

156
0:5:23,38 --> 0:5:24,54
You've been kind to everyone,

157
0:5:24,54 --> 0:5:25,26
you've set up a crowdfunding campaign,

158
0:5:25,26 --> 0:5:26,32
you've spent money on others,

159
0:5:26,32 --> 0:5:28,48
and in the end, when you try to sort things out,

160
0:5:28,48 --> 0:5:30,83
you realize you're the one without any money.

161
0:5:30,83 --> 0:5:33,15
You might think that in many situations in this world,

162
0:5:33,15 --> 0:5:35,9
Really, the world punishes those who are too kind.

163
0:5:35,9 --> 0:5:38,98
Once your kindness goes beyond the proper bounds,

164
0:5:38,98 --> 0:5:40,7
people will think you're easy to take advantage of.

165
0:5:40,7 --> 0:5:43,6
They might even think you're wasting their time.

166
0:5:43,6 --> 0:5:43,98
Why wouldn't they?

167
0:5:43,98 --> 0:5:44,73
You have money, after all.

168
0:5:44,73 --> 0:5:45,37
Right?

169
0:5:45,37 --> 0:5:45,97
You do have money,

170
0:5:45,97 --> 0:5:47,17
and you speak so timidly.

171
0:5:47,17 --> 0:5:47,79
Right?

172
0:5:47,79 --> 0:5:48,77
You're so timid when you speak.

173
0:5:48,77 --> 0:5:50,92
It just shows that you're easy to push around.

174
0:5:50,92 --> 0:5:51,24
Oh.

175
0:5:51,24 --> 0:5:52,44
You are one of the intelligentsia.

176
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:53,36
You're just middle-class.

177
0:5:53,36 --> 0:5:54,909
You're so easy to bully.

178
0:5:54,909 --> 0:5:56,549
You really are easy to push around.

179
0:5:56,549 --> 0:5:58,89
Bro Rong is indeed easy to bully.

180
0:5:58,89 --> 0:6:3,79
Brother Rong never makes things difficult for the common people

181
0:6:3,79 --> 0:6:5,39
no matter who you are

182
0:6:5,39 --> 0:6:7,75
whether it's the food delivery guy

183
0:6:7,75 --> 0:6:10,59
or, let's be honest

184
0:6:10,59 --> 0:6:12,99
or the sex worker

185
0:6:12,99 --> 0:6:15,47
of course, putting these two together isn't appropriate

186
0:6:15,47 --> 0:6:19,22
but I still believe that it's just different jobs

187
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:21,64
But I should be respected.

188
0:6:21,64 --> 0:6:23,74
but let's be honest

189
0:6:23,74 --> 0:6:25,27
In this world

190
0:6:25,27 --> 0:6:26,89
In the world of The Lower Depths,

191
0:6:26,89 --> 0:6:28,59
there's a lot of backstabbing

192
0:6:28,59 --> 0:6:30,23
a lot of cunning grabs for power and wealth

193
0:6:30,23 --> 0:6:33,12
a lot of schemes that target the honest

194
0:6:33,12 --> 0:6:34,4
the poor

195
0:6:34,4 --> 0:6:36,61
the kind-hearted

196
0:6:36,61 --> 0:6:38,25
If you're at the bottom

197
0:6:38,25 --> 0:6:42,46
you'll see a lot of the less savory aspects of the world

198
0:6:42,46 --> 0:6:43,34
That's right.

199
0:6:43,34 --> 0:6:45,5
That's why sometimes I prefer taking the high-speed train.

200
0:6:45,5 --> 0:6:47,8
I like to sit in the business class.

201
0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:48,85
At the very least, I'll choose first class.

202
0:6:48,85 --> 0:6:50,85
But last time, I tried the unreserved seat.

203
0:6:50,85 --> 0:6:51,89
I tried the unreserved seat.

204
0:6:51,89 --> 0:6:54,31
I was shuffled around to second class.

205
0:6:54,31 --> 0:6:55,31
People looked down on me.

206
0:6:55,31 --> 0:6:57,23
I really felt the warmth and coldness of human nature then.

207
0:6:57,23 --> 0:7:0,47
I think this is the best way to learn about society.

208
0:7:0,47 --> 0:7:1,39
It's a great supplement.

209
0:7:1,39 --> 0:7:3,61
This time, it gave me a valuable lesson.

210
0:7:3,61 --> 0:7:5,64
He He doesn't give good reviews to people.

211
0:7:5,64 --> 0:7:7,8
Actually, he's right.

212
0:7:7,8 --> 0:7:8,68
Because he has the right to choose.

213
0:7:8,68 --> 0:7:9,68
He doesn't want to be pressured.

214
0:7:9,68 --> 0:7:11,289
I understand him now.

215
0:7:11,289 --> 0:7:13,929
At the time, I thought he didn't understand.

216
0:7:13,929 --> 0:7:15,49
all sorts of things

217
0:7:15,49 --> 0:7:16,449
for this time, I

218
0:7:16,449 --> 0:7:17,689
myself, this saintly person

219
0:7:17,689 --> 0:7:18,389
I do agree

220
0:7:18,389 --> 0:7:19,509
the common people are great

221
0:7:19,509 --> 0:7:21,36
I treat others really well

222
0:7:21,36 --> 0:7:22,3
I give tips to people

223
0:7:22,3 --> 0:7:23,46
what are you showing off for

224
0:7:23,46 --> 0:7:25,24
are you showing off how rich you are

225
0:7:25,24 --> 0:7:27,71
Give me a discount on the takeout you're ordering.

226
0:7:27,71 --> 0:7:29,419
Then you'd be a rich person.

227
0:7:29,419 --> 0:7:30,619
Then you'd be a saint.

228
0:7:30,619 --> 0:7:31,719
Then you'd be something special.

229
0:7:31,719 --> 0:7:33,599
But I'll deliberately deliver your meal last.

230
0:7:33,599 --> 0:7:35,239
I won't deliver your meal for over a month.

231
0:7:35,239 --> 0:7:36,44
I'll just circle around here.

232
0:7:36,44 --> 0:7:38,34
Because I know you're easy to bully.

233
0:7:38,34 --> 0:7:40,24
Because I know I can't not deliver other people's meals.

234
0:7:40,24 --> 0:7:41,4
Because others will file complaints against me.

235
0:7:41,4 --> 0:7:42,14
They'll give me bad reviews.

236
0:7:42,14 --> 0:7:43,44
But are you in the right?

237
0:7:43,44 --> 0:7:44,85
You don't even buy on-time delivery insurance.

238
0:7:44,85 --> 0:7:46,29
So I'll take over an hour to deliver to you.

239
0:7:46,29 --> 0:7:47,23
I'll wait until the last minute.

240
0:7:47,23 --> 0:7:48,45
I know you tipped me.

241
0:7:48,45 --> 0:7:49,53
Your tip doesn't change anything.

242
0:7:49,53 --> 0:7:50,7
It's what I deserve.

243
0:7:50,7 --> 0:7:52,26
So in this world, we often say,

244
0:7:52,26 --> 0:7:54,8
Many times, we say,

245
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:56,4
Some people are overly nice to others,

246
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:57,9
They provide endless emotional support,

247
0:7:57,9 --> 0:7:59,32
Just like me today.

248
0:7:59,32 --> 0:8:1,68
That's why we say human nature can't withstand the test.

249
0:8:1,68 --> 0:8:5,88
Folks, don't be too naive.

250
0:8:5,88 --> 0:8:8,24
I teach others online every day,

251
0:8:8,24 --> 0:8:10,14
But in the end, I got a lesson from society myself.

252
0:8:10,14 --> 0:8:12,52
You see, I really became a clown.

253
0:8:12,52 --> 0:8:14,6
So this is karma.

254
0:8:14,6 --> 0:8:15,92
Sometimes, not everyone,

255
0:8:15,92 --> 0:8:17,62
Is worth being so nice to.
