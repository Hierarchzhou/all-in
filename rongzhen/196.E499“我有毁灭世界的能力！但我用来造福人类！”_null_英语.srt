1
0:0:0,98 --> 0:0:3,26
I've noticed that this person's perception in their youth

2
0:0:3,26 --> 0:0:6,13
is completely different from when they're older.

3
0:0:6,13 --> 0:0:8,45
For example, looking at the Russia-Ukraine conflict these past two years.

4
0:0:8,45 --> 0:0:11,64
Actually, I've gradually become more calm because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

5
0:0:11,64 --> 0:0:15,0
I used to be very passionate and excited.

6
0:0:15,0 --> 0:0:17,94
But now I've become much calmer.

7
0:0:17,94 --> 0:0:22,93
Firstly, as the saying goes, a good warrior doesn't seek glory.

8
0:0:22,93 --> 0:0:25,27
It's often said that a general's fame is built on countless lives lost.

9
0:0:25,27 --> 0:0:28,179
Many times, if you engage in war too aggressively,

10
0:0:28,179 --> 0:0:29,999
you can indeed leave behind a glorious record of battles.

11
0:0:29,999 --> 0:0:31,379
You'll be remembered in history

12
0:0:31,379 --> 0:0:34,319
But what kind of life will you leave behind?

13
0:0:34,319 --> 0:0:35,2
Right?

14
0:0:35,2 --> 0:0:36,28
Well, how do you put it?

15
0:0:36,28 --> 0:0:37,94
Since ancient times, the dead have been left unburied

16
0:0:37,94 --> 0:0:38,92
It's just a matter of a few millimeters

17
0:0:38,92 --> 0:0:41,1
And there's the Ballad of Mulan

18
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:42,96
Often depicting the chaotic war years

19
0:0:42,96 --> 0:0:44,87
The people's lives were truly miserable

20
0:0:44,87 --> 0:0:47,19
If I were in today's Russia

21
0:0:47,19 --> 0:0:49,11
Or a 40-year-old male from Ukraine

22
0:0:49,11 --> 0:0:51,9
I'd most likely be arrested on my way to the internet cafe

23
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:52,5
Right?

24
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:53,7
This is extremely painful

25
0:0:53,7 --> 0:0:55,379
So I used to think, oh

26
0:0:55,379 --> 0:0:57,939
Why doesn't our country use its good weapons

27
0:0:57,939 --> 0:1:0,139
We need to show off our strength too

28
0:1:0,139 --> 0:1:2,26
My mindset shifted right away.

29
0:1:2,26 --> 0:1:4,46
When you really have to pay the price

30
0:1:4,46 --> 0:1:5,36
You don't think that way anymore

31
0:1:5,36 --> 0:1:6,18
So much of the time,

32
0:1:6,18 --> 0:1:9,11
I feel that peace and development are the prevailing trends.

33
0:1:9,11 --> 0:1:11,61
Still, these are the things that the world has developed today.

34
0:1:11,61 --> 0:1:13,31
We have the capability to destroy the world,

35
0:1:13,31 --> 0:1:14,79
but we use it to benefit humanity.

36
0:1:14,79 --> 0:1:17,23
This is truly the greatest good.

37
0:1:17,23 --> 0:1:18,73
The good person wins without fighting.

38
0:1:18,73 --> 0:1:19,71
This is the most powerful approach.

39
0:1:19,71 --> 0:1:22,58
After all, even if you can fight, what does it achieve?

40
0:1:22,58 --> 0:1:25,34
Wouldn't that just result in countless casualties?

41
0:1:25,34 --> 0:1:27,15
It has no practical significance

42
0:1:27,15 --> 0:1:28,23
So, to explain

43
0:1:28,23 --> 0:1:29,95
What does it mean to follow the will of heaven?

44
0:1:29,95 --> 0:1:31,23
What does that even mean?

45
0:1:31,23 --> 0:1:33,59
It means to ensure the people can live in peace and prosperity

46
0:1:33,59 --> 0:1:35,48
To make sure everyone can survive

47
0:1:35,48 --> 0:1:37,14
This is known as the way of sustenance

48
0:1:37,14 --> 0:1:38,44
To let life thrive

49
0:1:38,44 --> 0:1:40,52
It’s about ensuring the continuity of life

50
0:1:40,52 --> 0:1:42,2
This is the most crucial aspect

51
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:43,38
So, in many cases,

52
0:1:43,38 --> 0:1:44,46
when we're young,

53
0:1:44,46 --> 0:1:45,26
why is this so?

54
0:1:45,26 --> 0:1:48,0
Because in our youth, we're full of passion,

55
0:1:48,0 --> 0:1:50,58
driven by hormones and genes,

56
0:1:50,58 --> 0:1:51,7
we want to tear things down,

57
0:1:51,7 --> 0:1:52,67
we want to destroy,

58
0:1:52,67 --> 0:1:53,95
yet we also want to achieve great things,

59
0:1:53,95 --> 0:1:57,39
but our achievements often come at the cost of our peers,

60
0:1:57,39 --> 0:1:59,25
with the loss of many lives.

61
0:1:59,25 --> 0:2:2,14
In the end, who can truly live on after the war is over?

62
0:2:2,14 --> 0:2:3,62
In reality,

63
0:2:3,62 --> 0:2:5,66
your social status remains the same,

64
0:2:5,66 --> 0:2:7,98
you just drag your wounded body,

65
0:2:7,98 --> 0:2:10,629
and return to your Russian hometown.

66
0:2:10,629 --> 0:2:12,28
Often, that's how it is.

67
0:2:12,28 --> 0:2:14,46
So today we need to look at many aspects to discuss,

68
0:2:14,46 --> 0:2:17,66
whether fighting a war to the bitter end is the right choice.

69
0:2:17,66 --> 0:2:19,48
Generally speaking, it's not.

70
0:2:19,48 --> 0:2:21,62
and whether the people can have enough to eat.

71
0:2:21,62 --> 0:2:23,0
to ensure the people live and work in peace and contentment

72
0:2:23,0 --> 0:2:24,69
then everyone remains calm

73
0:2:24,69 --> 0:2:27,73
and doesn’t feel overly worried about these issues

74
0:2:27,73 --> 0:2:28,81
a strong national defense

75
0:2:28,81 --> 0:2:29,67
robust public security

76
0:2:29,67 --> 0:2:31,54
all these things speak for themselves

77
0:2:31,54 --> 0:2:34,7
all of which have been achieved at a tremendous cost by countless individuals

78
0:2:34,7 --> 0:2:36,64
so it’s not something that’s easily attained

79
0:2:36,64 --> 0:2:38,34
so what one pursues in their youth

80
0:2:38,34 --> 0:2:41,449
is entirely different from what they value when they grow older

81
0:2:41,449 --> 0:2:43,5
When you really start to age

82
0:2:43,5 --> 0:2:44,67
you start to take charge

83
0:2:44,67 --> 0:2:45,85
you don't realize it until you're in charge

84
0:2:45,85 --> 0:2:47,17
how expensive the necessities of life can be

85
0:2:47,17 --> 0:2:49,93
Often, as your parents get older

86
0:2:49,93 --> 0:2:51,1
they fall ill due to old age

87
0:2:51,1 --> 0:2:54,53
you also have to take your children to the pediatric hospital

88
0:2:54,53 --> 0:2:56,42
to get an appointment at the children's hospital

89
0:2:56,42 --> 0:2:58,54
the emergency queue numbers go into the thousands

90
0:2:58,54 --> 0:2:59,61
reaching four digits

91
0:2:59,61 --> 0:3:2,27
You really get a sense of what despair feels like.

92
0:3:2,27 --> 0:3:3,89
And at this moment, a middle-aged person

93
0:3:3,89 --> 0:3:5,6
is overwhelmed by the weight of life.

94
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:7,36
Unlike when they were young and could feed themselves

95
0:3:7,36 --> 0:3:8,36
and ensure the whole family wasn't hungry.

96
0:3:8,36 --> 0:3:9,72
You have that constant feeling

97
0:3:9,72 --> 0:3:13,24
of being in the phase of wanting to mate and make money.

98
0:3:13,24 --> 0:3:14,98
You're broke but still want to mate.

99
0:3:14,98 --> 0:3:15,8
Then you just feel

100
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:16,93
that the world is so unfair.

101
0:3:16,93 --> 0:3:18,53
I need to have my own space

102
0:3:18,53 --> 0:3:19,69
I need to have my own something

103
0:3:19,69 --> 0:3:22,779
But you'll find that modern economic life is quite complex

104
0:3:22,779 --> 0:3:24,779
So you've made a good plan

105
0:3:24,779 --> 0:3:26,619
When you have a precise grasp of it

106
0:3:26,619 --> 0:3:29,29
You can make your life exceptionally wonderful

107
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:30,37
So speaking of it

108
0:3:30,37 --> 0:3:32,53
This is the purpose of my writing books and making videos.

109
0:3:32,53 --> 0:3:35,959
It's to guide everyone towards a healthier

110
0:3:35,959 --> 0:3:37,559
More sustainable kind of development

111
0:3:37,559 --> 0:3:39,679
Rather than just rushing into things without thinking

112
0:3:39,679 --> 0:3:41,269
Or making hasty decisions in a moment of frustration

113
0:3:41,269 --> 0:3:43,709
Instead of getting lost in grand narratives

114
0:3:43,709 --> 0:3:46,189
An idealized projection of one's own future

115
0:3:46,189 --> 0:3:47,89
A mere imagination

116
0:3:47,89 --> 0:3:48,329
That's not very meaningful

117
0:3:48,329 --> 0:3:50,529
Only by living a good personal life

118
0:3:50,529 --> 0:3:52,569
Can it truly be considered a good life

119
0:3:52,569 --> 0:3:54,289
So, based on this premise

120
0:3:54,289 --> 0:3:55,449
Let's look at some historical figures

121
0:3:55,449 --> 0:3:56,65
We'll understand it then.

122
0:3:56,65 --> 0:3:58,97
In fact, many historical figures, like Jia Xu, were similar.

123
0:3:58,97 --> 0:4:0,13
He was genuinely smart.

124
0:4:0,13 --> 0:4:3,21
Because he knew how to diminish the ambitions of the heroes across the land during the late Eastern Han Dynasty.

125
0:4:3,21 --> 0:4:4,17
There were so many aristocrats.

126
0:4:4,17 --> 0:4:6,71
So many people wanted to seize control of provinces and commanderies.

127
0:4:6,71 --> 0:4:7,95
Wanted to deceive the world and steal fame.

128
0:4:7,95 --> 0:4:9,15
Wanted to claim titles and rule as lone wolves.

129
0:4:9,15 --> 0:4:11,33
These people were so repulsive.

130
0:4:11,33 --> 0:4:12,4
Right?

131
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:14,94
Those people are actually no longer necessary.

132
0:4:14,94 --> 0:4:16,86
That led to Li Juo's death.

133
0:4:16,86 --> 0:4:20,769
Killing the nobles and officials in Chang'an.

134
0:4:20,769 --> 0:4:22,869
Causing the Eastern Han court to fall apart.

135
0:4:22,869 --> 0:4:25,529
And killing ambitious figures like Cao Cao.

136
0:4:25,529 --> 0:4:27,69
Then making him fall apart as well.

137
0:4:27,69 --> 0:4:29,11
Cao Ang, the successor, also met the same fate.

138
0:4:29,11 --> 0:4:30,55
So, to put it simply,

139
0:4:30,55 --> 0:4:33,79
Jia Xu has undermined many nobles throughout his life.

140
0:4:33,79 --> 0:4:35,13
But he never undermined the common people.

141
0:4:35,13 --> 0:4:38,47
That's why after World War II and the invention of nuclear weapons,

142
0:4:38,47 --> 0:4:40,25
the number of wars actually decreased.

143
0:4:40,25 --> 0:4:41,49
It's mostly major powers bullying smaller countries.

144
0:4:41,49 --> 0:4:44,39
There are rarely direct conflicts between two major powers.

145
0:4:44,39 --> 0:4:45,51
Mostly, it's proxy wars.

146
0:4:45,51 --> 0:4:46,51
Why is this the case?

147
0:4:46,51 --> 0:4:50,69
Because the initiators of war can now be easily destroyed.

148
0:4:50,69 --> 0:4:53,31
So once the initiators of war can be easily destroyed,

149
0:4:53,31 --> 0:4:56,51
once that becomes the cost,

150
0:4:56,51 --> 0:4:59,19
many people decide it's not worth starting a war.

151
0:4:59,19 --> 0:5:0,7
Let's call it the final battle.

152
0:5:0,7 --> 0:5:0,87
Don't say defeat.

153
0:5:0,87 --> 0:5:1,83
Always say the final battle.

154
0:5:1,83 --> 0:5:3,95
This is where many people are hypocritical.

155
0:5:3,95 --> 0:5:6,67
So this really hits a nerve with humans when it comes to

156
0:5:6,67 --> 0:5:7,79
the pain that is felt personally.

157
0:5:7,79 --> 0:5:10,2
When someone says war is necessary,

158
0:5:10,2 --> 0:5:12,38
If the war starters themselves had to die,

159
0:5:12,38 --> 0:5:14,18
Would the war still be necessary?

160
0:5:14,18 --> 0:5:15,74
So that's how it all works out.

161
0:5:15,74 --> 0:5:17,86
When you make the first move in a game of Chinese chess,

162
0:5:17,86 --> 0:5:19,5
the two generals see each other right away.

163
0:5:19,5 --> 0:5:20,78
Whoever sees the other first can fly and eliminate them.

164
0:5:20,78 --> 0:5:22,28
Then the game is over.

165
0:5:22,28 --> 0:5:26,4
So everything is based on the generals, the commanders,

166
0:5:26,4 --> 0:5:28,88
ending the game with their capture as the fundamental outcome.

167
0:5:28,88 --> 0:5:30,48
This is why after the invention of nuclear weapons,

168
0:5:30,48 --> 0:5:33,33
the number of human wars has drastically decreased.

169
0:5:33,33 --> 0:5:37,8
In ancient times, kings lived in castles,

170
0:5:37,8 --> 0:5:39,0
surrounded by layers of their own royal guards.

171
0:5:39,0 --> 0:5:40,21
They have their own personal guards

172
0:5:40,21 --> 0:5:42,99
So they won't be harmed in the slightest

173
0:5:42,99 --> 0:5:45,39
Therefore, the so-called pain is

174
0:5:45,39 --> 0:5:49,4
For them, the common people are like clothes or fur

175
0:5:49,4 --> 0:5:50,7
It won't hurt their bones

176
0:5:50,7 --> 0:5:51,58
Their own nobles

177
0:5:51,58 --> 0:5:54,12
These Kshatriyas are their own

178
0:5:54,12 --> 0:5:55,94
How should I put it

179
0:5:55,94 --> 0:5:58,399
The foundation of their rule

180
0:5:58,399 --> 0:5:59,499
These Eight Banners

181
0:5:59,499 --> 0:6:0,75
These monks

182
0:6:0,75 --> 0:6:4,67
These Attendant Guard and Imperial Army troops are the foundation of my own strength.

183
0:6:4,67 --> 0:6:6,26
These Tian Ce generals

184
0:6:6,26 --> 0:6:9,1
So in many cases, it won't harm themselves

185
0:6:9,1 --> 0:6:10,0
He just wants to fight

186
0:6:10,0 --> 0:6:11,34
Once they get hurt

187
0:6:11,34 --> 0:6:12,27
He doesn't want to fight anymore

188
0:6:12,27 --> 0:6:16,11
Actually, you can see I've transformed from a passionate young man

189
0:6:16,11 --> 0:6:18,1
Into a straightforward middle-aged person as well

190
0:6:18,1 --> 0:6:19,11
Truly understanding

191
0:6:19,11 --> 0:6:21,36
One day you might start a war yourself

192
0:6:21,36 --> 0:6:22,28
When the first wave dies

193
0:6:22,28 --> 0:6:23,76
you won’t be trying to persuade these people anymore

194
0:6:23,76 --> 0:6:26,77
Many people always think about being doomsday preppers

195
0:6:26,77 --> 0:6:28,51
Always think about the end of the world

196
0:6:28,51 --> 0:6:29,69
thinking they could make it through

197
0:6:29,69 --> 0:6:32,23
but in reality, you’d just be one of the 10 trillion zombies

198
0:6:32,23 --> 0:6:32,74
right?

199
0:6:32,74 --> 0:6:34,2
So, what I’m saying is

200
0:6:34,2 --> 0:6:36,71
once you become the victim

201
0:6:36,71 --> 0:6:37,69
You wouldn't think that way.

202
0:6:37,69 --> 0:6:38,95
What's known as the track theory.

203
0:6:38,95 --> 0:6:40,19
If you were there,

204
0:6:40,19 --> 0:6:41,55
Whether it's five people or one person,

205
0:6:41,55 --> 0:6:43,67
You're the one tied to the track.

206
0:6:43,67 --> 0:6:45,15
You wouldn't think that way anymore.

207
0:6:45,15 --> 0:6:46,31
When it comes to boosting the economy,

208
0:6:46,31 --> 0:6:47,53
If it comes at your expense,

209
0:6:47,53 --> 0:6:48,75
You wouldn't think that way.

210
0:6:48,75 --> 0:6:51,319
So everything depends on who the starting point is.

211
0:6:51,319 --> 0:6:52,359
So no matter what

212
0:6:52,359 --> 0:6:54,44
If those songs praising war are necessary

213
0:6:54,44 --> 0:6:56,0
These things that seem so sweet

214
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:57,84
Let him try going to the battlefield himself

215
0:6:57,84 --> 0:7:0,12
Face the landmines head-on

216
0:7:0,12 --> 0:7:1,72
Fight against the drones

217
0:7:1,72 --> 0:7:3,14
Would he still think the same way

218
0:7:3,14 --> 0:7:5,26
In many cases at that time

219
0:7:5,26 --> 0:7:8,86
We would say the world isn't as terrifying as it seems

220
0:7:8,86 --> 0:7:10,22
When the day comes

221
0:7:10,22 --> 0:7:12,8
This person doesn't have to step onto the battlefield

222
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:14,56
It's all about machines competing against each other

223
0:7:14,56 --> 0:7:16,88
So I believe people will definitely be liberated in this way

224
0:7:16,88 --> 0:7:17,88
But that's not necessarily the case

225
0:7:17,88 --> 0:7:21,22
Because only when those who initiate wars are deterred from doing so easily

226
0:7:21,22 --> 0:7:23,92
Can true peace for humanity truly be achieved

227
0:7:23,92 --> 0:7:25,97
So we often say

228
0:7:25,97 --> 0:7:28,9
A skilled warrior doesn't seek glory

229
0:7:28,9 --> 0:7:29,45
When it comes to it, though

230
0:7:29,45 --> 0:7:31,58
Although it means maintaining peace

231
0:7:31,58 --> 0:7:33,56
Eliminate the one who replaced and eradicated

232
0:7:33,56 --> 0:7:35,54
This feels like a great achievement

233
0:7:35,54 --> 0:7:36,12
It's quite something

234
0:7:36,12 --> 0:7:38,939
But history has given these figures too much

235
0:7:38,939 --> 0:7:39,919
Too much credit

236
0:7:39,919 --> 0:7:42,59
Too much, how to say, glory

237
0:7:42,59 --> 0:7:44,659
And the ones who truly made a difference without their presence

238
0:7:44,659 --> 0:7:46,179
Without launching large-scale wars

239
0:7:46,179 --> 0:7:47,59
Because of their presence

240
0:7:47,59 --> 0:7:48,66
People are very content

241
0:7:48,66 --> 0:7:49,34
It's truly harmonious

242
0:7:49,34 --> 0:7:50,16
People live and work in peace and contentment

243
0:7:50,16 --> 0:7:52,62
This is the true great achievement of history

244
0:7:52,62 --> 0:7:54,25
That is to say

245
0:7:54,25 --> 0:7:54,91
He loves the people

246
0:7:54,91 --> 0:7:55,63
People live and work in peace and contentment

247
0:7:55,63 --> 0:7:57,19
This is the greatest merit

248
0:7:57,19 --> 0:7:58,27
Instead of exhausting resources on military might

249
0:7:58,27 --> 0:7:58,95
Exhausting resources on military might

250
0:7:58,95 --> 0:8:0,68
In the end, they will all end up in utter defeat
