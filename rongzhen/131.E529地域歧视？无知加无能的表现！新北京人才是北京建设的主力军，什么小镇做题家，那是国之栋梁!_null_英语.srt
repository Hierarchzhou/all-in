0:0:0,42 --> 0:0:1,2
Hi everyone

2
0:0:1,2 --> 0:0:2,14
Welcome to a new episode

3
0:0:2,14 --> 0:0:4,87
In this episode, I'll talk about the new Beijingers

4
0:0:4,87 --> 0:0:6,77
Beijing often

5
0:0:6,77 --> 0:0:9,79
tends to label some people as outsiders, intentionally or not

6
0:0:9,79 --> 0:0:12,33
Beijingers, like Shanghainese, might say

7
0:0:12,33 --> 0:0:13,84
country folks and Shanghainese

8
0:0:13,84 --> 0:0:18,8
but in fact, if we start counting from the population census of 1949

9
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:21,45
the actual urban residents of Beijing back then were only one million

10
0:0:21,45 --> 0:0:23,81
most people are actually new Beijingers

11
0:0:23,81 --> 0:0:25,29
That means after 49 years.

12
0:0:25,29 --> 0:0:27,83
Like our family, we moved in 43.

13
0:0:27,83 --> 0:0:29,57
Some of the grandpa's generation came over.

14
0:0:29,57 --> 0:0:32,3
Then, in the early to mid-fifties,

15
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:33,31
people from grandma's side came over.

16
0:0:33,31 --> 0:0:34,75
But we're all new Beijingers, really.

17
0:0:34,75 --> 0:0:36,6
Especially in Chaoyang District,

18
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:37,46
and Haidian District,

19
0:0:37,46 --> 0:0:39,32
but the proportion in Chaoyang is smaller,

20
0:0:39,32 --> 0:0:41,1
while the proportion in Haidian is larger.

21
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:42,78
After the 1990s,

22
0:0:42,78 --> 0:0:46,28
the population in Beijing gradually increased,

23
0:0:46,28 --> 0:0:47,74
Starting from the 1990s,

24
0:0:47,74 --> 0:0:50,39
most people began moving to Chaoyang District,

25
0:0:50,39 --> 0:0:52,53
but recently, it has become Tongzhou District,

26
0:0:52,53 --> 0:0:53,91
many people are buying houses in Tongzhou District,

27
0:0:53,91 --> 0:0:57,15
I want to break a misconception here,

28
0:0:57,15 --> 0:0:58,97
I will talk about this in the next three episodes,

29
0:0:58,97 --> 0:1:2,14
about the reality of breaking this misconception,

30
0:1:2,14 --> 0:1:4,36
what exactly does breaking a misconception mean?

31
0:1:4,36 --> 0:1:9,39
There are some things we consider to be established by usage.

32
0:1:9,39 --> 0:1:11,27
But in reality, that's not the case.

33
0:1:11,27 --> 0:1:12,49
But you know,

34
0:1:12,49 --> 0:1:14,5
What does it mean to enhance cognition?

35
0:1:14,5 --> 0:1:15,43
Cognition is not the same as knowledge.

36
0:1:15,43 --> 0:1:16,73
Knowledge is 'knowledge',

37
0:1:16,73 --> 0:1:17,82
Cognition is 'acknowledgment'.

38
0:1:17,82 --> 0:1:19,1
Many things are different.

39
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:22,74
Cognition is the process of gradually understanding how the world operates.

40
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:23,97
It's a journey of discovery.

41
0:1:23,97 --> 0:1:27,87
Cognition can draw inspiration from the thoughts of predecessors.

42
0:1:27,87 --> 0:1:29,87
One aspect is that others have already mentioned it.

43
0:1:29,87 --> 0:1:31,43
Another aspect of cognition is that

44
0:1:31,43 --> 0:1:32,41
practice leads to true knowledge.

45
0:1:33,65 --> 0:1:36,11
Practice can bring new insights.

46
0:1:36,11 --> 0:1:40,4
Many practices vary due to different eras, technological methods, and people involved.

47
0:1:40,4 --> 0:1:42,92
so each practice

48
0:1:42,92 --> 0:1:45,56
conducted at different points in time

49
0:1:45,56 --> 0:1:47,12
yields entirely different outcomes.

50
0:1:47,12 --> 0:1:47,96
Because times are changing.

51
0:1:47,96 --> 0:1:49,33
People evolve over time.

52
0:1:49,33 --> 0:1:51,69
People from 100 years ago are entirely different from those today.

53
0:1:51,69 --> 0:1:52,89
They are completely distinct.

54
0:1:52,89 --> 0:1:53,79
Two different groups of people.

55
0:1:53,79 --> 0:1:56,35
Twenty years, ten years, five years make up a generation.

56
0:1:56,35 --> 0:1:57,99
That's why we say practice makes perfect.

57
0:1:57,99 --> 0:2:0,9
It's a very reasonable statement.

58
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:4,16
Speaking of which, I think it's important to note that

59
0:2:4,16 --> 0:2:6,22
Especially in a place like Beijing,

60
0:2:6,22 --> 0:2:8,949
We can say it's the new Beijingers.

61
0:2:8,949 --> 0:2:12,929
The town's problem solvers are the real economic and cultural hub of Beijing

62
0:2:12,929 --> 0:2:16,7
and the center of capabilities in various fields

63
0:2:16,7 --> 0:2:18,71
not these so-called old Beijingers

64
0:2:18,71 --> 0:2:20,99
the so-called original residents

65
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:22,43
Why do I say this?

66
0:2:22,43 --> 0:2:24,19
Actually, it's about multiple dimensions

67
0:2:24,19 --> 0:2:25,19
several layers

68
0:2:25,19 --> 0:2:29,22
On the surface, many people feel they lack a sense of belonging in Beijing

69
0:2:29,22 --> 0:2:31,14
unlike Shenzhen, where newcomers are immediately considered Shenzhen residents

70
0:2:31,14 --> 0:2:33,579
Shenzhen is a very vibrant and emerging city

71
0:2:33,579 --> 0:2:37,399
But in Beijing, there's this kind of conflict between old and new residents.

72
0:2:37,399 --> 0:2:38,719
On the surface, some people think that

73
0:2:38,719 --> 0:2:41,829
old Beijingers have made a fortune from demolishing and selling multiple properties.

74
0:2:41,829 --> 0:2:44,509
But in fact, most old Beijingers are poor.

75
0:2:44,509 --> 0:2:46,169
In reality, they form the majority.

76
0:2:46,169 --> 0:2:48,149
It's the new Beijingers who are mostly wealthy.

77
0:2:48,149 --> 0:2:49,52
Many people say, 'That's not right, though.'

78
0:2:49,52 --> 0:2:50,52
How can it be that Beijingers

79
0:2:50,52 --> 0:2:51,8
at least have one property or something?

80
0:2:51,8 --> 0:2:52,16
What do you think?

81
0:2:52,16 --> 0:2:54,56
We'll take our time and talk about it in this video.

82
0:2:54,56 --> 0:2:58,1
In the next couple of episodes, I'll delve deeper into this topic.

83
0:2:58,1 --> 0:2:59,24
Why is Xiao Shen a study enthusiast?

84
0:2:59,24 --> 0:3:1,86
People who become second-generation students often suffer more.

85
0:3:1,86 --> 0:3:4,18
Then let's talk about the poor people's attitude towards money.

86
0:3:4,18 --> 0:3:6,54
Why do the poor actually love starting businesses?

87
0:3:6,54 --> 0:3:9,3
The rich, in fact, are quite cautious when it comes to doing things.

88
0:3:9,3 --> 0:3:11,32
I will go into specific details about these topics.

89
0:3:11,32 --> 0:3:13,88
Many poor people lack a clear understanding of money.

90
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:15,32
This is the content for the next three episodes.

91
0:3:15,32 --> 0:3:16,28
Absolutely fantastic

92
0:3:16,28 --> 0:3:17,4
So then

93
0:3:17,4 --> 0:3:19,56
I’ll insert a little ad at the end or in the middle

94
0:3:19,56 --> 0:3:20,6
just to let you know where you can buy my book

95
0:3:20,6 --> 0:3:22,78
because some of the videos now

96
0:3:22,78 --> 0:3:24,26
Because there are some videos now

97
0:3:24,26 --> 0:3:25,86
Many people don't follow live streams

98
0:3:25,86 --> 0:3:26,74
Watch only the video

99
0:3:26,74 --> 0:3:28,98
since we can’t post QR codes here on Bilibili

100
0:3:32,299 --> 0:3:33,539
Because this counts as a business promotion

101
0:3:33,539 --> 0:3:34,699
But I can be in the video

102
0:3:34,699 --> 0:3:36,59
I can put a link in the pinned area

103
0:3:36,59 --> 0:3:39,67
Many people generally think that Beijingers are wealthy

104
0:3:39,67 --> 0:3:42,59
But in reality, many Beijingers aren’t rich at all

105
0:3:42,59 --> 0:3:43,95
For most people

106
0:3:43,95 --> 0:3:47,91
They’re not like those who got compensated for their houses being demolished in the suburbs

107
0:3:47,91 --> 0:3:50,44
Many people haven’t experienced that kind of demolition

108
0:3:50,44 --> 0:3:51,76
Some people are luckier

109
0:3:51,76 --> 0:3:52,68
Like my brother, for example

110
0:3:52,68 --> 0:3:53,92
He's rather fortunate in that regard.

111
0:3:53,92 --> 0:3:55,26
When it comes to his father,

112
0:3:55,26 --> 0:3:57,58
both he and his wife are only children.

113
0:3:57,58 --> 0:3:58,54
Being only children,

114
0:3:58,54 --> 0:4:1,99
along with the grandparents on both sides,

115
0:4:1,99 --> 0:4:5,29
various relatives are all the same,

116
0:4:5,29 --> 0:4:6,9
everyone buys a house,

117
0:4:6,9 --> 0:4:9,54
and in the end, everything will end up in his name.

118
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:12,8
So on average, one person ends up with three or four properties.

119
0:4:12,8 --> 0:4:14,61
Of course, this kind of situation is quite common.

120
0:4:14,61 --> 0:4:15,65
However, to be honest

121
0:4:15,65 --> 0:4:18,23
my situation is actually quite common

122
0:4:18,23 --> 0:4:19,79
these two types of people are quite common

123
0:4:19,79 --> 0:4:21,99
parents often don’t have separate rooms

124
0:4:21,99 --> 0:4:25,23
and often, there’s only one house left in the family

125
0:4:25,23 --> 0:4:26,99
so this person tends to be quite extreme

126
0:4:26,99 --> 0:4:28,11
either they have several properties

127
0:4:28,11 --> 0:4:29,47
or just one

128
0:4:29,47 --> 0:4:30,87
or even none at all

129
0:4:30,87 --> 0:4:32,59
some have always lived in public rental housing

130
0:4:32,59 --> 0:4:34,31
He has always lived in the old city of Beijing.

131
0:4:34,31 --> 0:4:35,59
But in fact, he doesn’t own the property rights.

132
0:4:35,59 --> 0:4:36,39
After he demolished it,

133
0:4:36,39 --> 0:4:38,3
he didn’t have enough money to buy a place in the suburbs.

134
0:4:38,3 --> 0:4:40,58
And for most Beijing residents,

135
0:4:40,58 --> 0:4:42,6
especially retired elderly men,

136
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:44,32
not everyone has a high pension.

137
0:4:44,32 --> 0:4:45,7
Some people have just an average pension.

138
0:4:45,7 --> 0:4:48,54
So besides the convenience of transportation,

139
0:4:48,54 --> 0:4:51,92
he can use his senior card to ride the bus and visit parks for free.

140
0:4:51,92 --> 0:4:53,8
His actual purchasing power

141
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:56,16
and the potential he can actually tap into are both very poor

142
0:4:56,16 --> 0:4:57,789
Many people don’t even have savings

143
0:4:57,789 --> 0:5:0,429
So the differences between individuals are quite significant

144
0:5:0,429 --> 0:5:3,449
Those who did business in the 90s or invested in real estate in the 2000s

145
0:5:3,449 --> 0:5:6,25
or those who made money from the stock market, they really hit the jackpot

146
0:5:6,25 --> 0:5:8,37
So some people have climbed up the wealth ladder

147
0:5:8,37 --> 0:5:10,11
but these people won’t exceed

148
0:5:10,11 --> 0:5:12,7
800,000 people, for that matter

149
0:5:12,7 --> 0:5:12,99
in reality

150
0:5:12,99 --> 0:5:16,26
Those who can currently afford assets worth over 4.5 million

151
0:5:16,26 --> 0:5:17,88
account for 720,000 in Beijing

152
0:5:17,88 --> 0:5:19,7
But how many millions of people are there in Beijing?

153
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:20,78
Including the permanent residents

154
0:5:20,78 --> 0:5:22,419
and the floating population of 30 million

155
0:5:22,419 --> 0:5:24,319
What percentage of these 30 million

156
0:5:24,319 --> 0:5:26,99
720,000 out of these 30 million

157
0:5:26,99 --> 0:5:27,659
What kind of percentage does that make?

158
0:5:27,659 --> 0:5:28,619
If we divide by three

159
0:5:28,619 --> 0:5:30,98
it comes out to about 1.4

160
0:5:30,98 --> 0:5:31,78
1.4%

161
0:5:31,78 --> 0:5:33,1
It should be 1.4%, right?

162
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:34,38
Let me think, 2.4%

163
0:5:34,38 --> 0:5:35,48
2.4%

164
0:5:35,48 --> 0:5:37,82
2.4 doesn't account for 2.4%

165
0:5:37,82 --> 0:5:39,54
So, as we often say,

166
0:5:39,54 --> 0:5:41,6
If you have a certain amount of assets,

167
0:5:41,6 --> 0:5:42,38
you're in the top 2% in China,

168
0:5:42,38 --> 0:5:42,9
the top 1%,

169
0:5:42,9 --> 0:5:44,74
or even the top 0.0001%.

170
0:5:44,74 --> 0:5:46,49
One is your disposable income.

171
0:5:46,49 --> 0:5:48,33
The other is the total amount of your assets.

172
0:5:48,33 --> 0:5:49,33
Including your house.

173
0:5:49,33 --> 0:5:51,49
But in reality, many people, even when including their house,

174
0:5:51,49 --> 0:5:53,21
their house is in the city center,

175
0:5:53,21 --> 0:5:55,65
they can't sell it and move to the suburbs afterward.

176
0:5:55,65 --> 0:5:56,69
My family is in this situation.

177
0:5:56,69 --> 0:5:59,17
You can't sell and move to the suburbs.

178
0:5:59,17 --> 0:6:0,58
He has to go to school,

179
0:6:0,58 --> 0:6:2,58
and healthcare isn't convenient either.

180
0:6:2,58 --> 0:6:3,44
My parents are getting old too.

181
0:6:3,44 --> 0:6:5,16
They're not used to living in the suburbs either.

182
0:6:5,16 --> 0:6:7,74
But what if this generation is no longer around?

183
0:6:7,74 --> 0:6:9,42
I would definitely make that choice.

184
0:6:9,42 --> 0:6:10,86
I might not even move to the suburbs.

185
0:6:10,86 --> 0:6:14,35
Perhaps I’d keep an apartment in Beijing to maintain the household registration.

186
0:6:14,35 --> 0:6:17,63
But it’s also possible that I would rent out the entire place or this apartment,

187
0:6:17,63 --> 0:6:18,43
or sell the house,

188
0:6:18,43 --> 0:6:19,31
or keep one apartment,

189
0:6:19,31 --> 0:6:21,32
and then move to another city to live.

190
0:6:21,32 --> 0:6:22,56
Actually, in many places

191
0:6:22,56 --> 0:6:26,38
in terms of their living standards and consumption levels

192
0:6:26,38 --> 0:6:27,92
when it comes to the feel of their daily life

193
0:6:27,92 --> 0:6:29,34
it's much more comfortable than in Beijing

194
0:6:29,34 --> 0:6:31,14
that's the reality for people in Beijing

195
0:6:31,14 --> 0:6:33,6
but when we talk about new Beijingers

196
0:6:33,6 --> 0:6:36,46
most of them are truly the backbone of Beijing's

197
0:6:36,46 --> 0:6:40,78
prosperity and development

198
0:6:40,78 --> 0:6:42,32
the feeling is actually the opposite

199
0:6:42,32 --> 0:6:44,299
You remind me of my elementary and middle school days.

200
0:6:44,299 --> 0:6:47,28
Most of the university professors are not from Beijing.

201
0:6:47,28 --> 0:6:49,6
They come from all over the country.

202
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:49,6
University students,

203
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:54,289
especially female teachers from Henan and Shandong provinces, are the most numerous.

204
0:6:54,289 --> 0:6:56,769
The reason Beijing has such advanced education,

205
0:6:56,769 --> 0:6:59,32
is largely due to these top universities being located here.

206
0:6:59,32 --> 0:7:0,24
So when we talk about it,

207
0:7:0,24 --> 0:7:1,24
the graduates of these universities,

208
0:7:1,24 --> 0:7:3,28
these outstanding graduates who come to Beijing's schools,

209
0:7:3,28 --> 0:7:5,2
they can be considered the best teachers in the country.

210
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:6,8
the most experienced

211
0:7:6,8 --> 0:7:7,56
and the highest quality graduates

212
0:7:7,56 --> 0:7:10,7
come to these key schools in Beijing

213
0:7:10,7 --> 0:7:11,39
for internships or work

214
0:7:11,39 --> 0:7:12,169
that's how it is

215
0:7:12,169 --> 0:7:15,169
and most people who buy houses in Beijing

216
0:7:15,169 --> 0:7:16,409
are actually new Beijingers

217
0:7:16,409 --> 0:7:19,229
and we're talking about all kinds of expensive properties in Beijing

218
0:7:19,229 --> 0:7:22,39
wealthy people from all over the country are gradually

219
0:7:22,39 --> 0:7:23,59
constantly renewing the demographics of Beijing

220
0:7:23,59 --> 0:7:25,0
It's the wealthier people

221
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:28,4
who tend to live in the most expensive and central areas of Beijing

222
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:30,44
In reality, those who can afford homes priced at hundreds of thousands

223
0:7:30,44 --> 0:7:33,94
are often not locals

224
0:7:33,94 --> 0:7:36,26
but people from all over the country

225
0:7:36,26 --> 0:7:37,86
These people move into new districts

226
0:7:37,86 --> 0:7:38,62
new areas

227
0:7:38,62 --> 0:7:40,54
and they are the ones buying new properties when they come on the market

228
0:7:40,54 --> 0:7:41,66
how many of them are old Beijing residents?

229
0:7:41,66 --> 0:7:42,14
Right?

230
0:7:42,14 --> 0:7:45,539
How many people actually own the so-called three or eight apartments?

231
0:7:45,539 --> 0:7:46,939
How many of those are in rural areas?

232
0:7:46,939 --> 0:7:47,899
How many are in the suburbs?

233
0:7:47,899 --> 0:7:49,19
How many are small-ownership properties?

234
0:7:49,19 --> 0:7:50,8
It's hard to say.

235
0:7:50,8 --> 0:7:52,32
So, those who are truly vibrant and capable,

236
0:7:52,32 --> 0:7:53,34
are the new Beijingers,

237
0:7:53,34 --> 0:7:54,76
with full benefits from major companies,

238
0:7:54,76 --> 0:7:55,8
or those who run their own businesses,

239
0:7:55,8 --> 0:7:56,78
it's people like these.

240
0:7:56,78 --> 0:7:58,9
So we say, this concept in practice

241
0:7:58,9 --> 0:8:0,18
Often we feel that

242
0:8:0,18 --> 0:8:1,34
As a new Beijinger

243
0:8:1,34 --> 0:8:4,19
I am currently in the process of applying for residency through the points system

244
0:8:4,19 --> 0:8:5,27
I am still dealing with these procedures

245
0:8:5,27 --> 0:8:6,31
I am still paying off my loans

246
0:8:6,31 --> 0:8:7,57
I feel quite insignificant

247
0:8:7,57 --> 0:8:8,67
There's no need for that

248
0:8:8,67 --> 0:8:9,35
Absolutely no need for that

249
0:8:9,35 --> 0:8:11,49
You are the true owner of this city

250
0:8:11,49 --> 0:8:13,409
The housing prices in this city are maintained by you.

251
0:8:13,409 --> 0:8:15,609
The rental values in this city are also maintained by you.

252
0:8:15,609 --> 0:8:17,649
The educational standards in this city are maintained by you.

253
0:8:17,649 --> 0:8:19,49
The primary consumers in this city

254
0:8:19,49 --> 0:8:20,23
are also sustained by you.

255
0:8:20,23 --> 0:8:21,59
The genuine old Beijingers,

256
0:8:21,59 --> 0:8:22,45
like me,

257
0:8:22,45 --> 0:8:25,59
of course, my generation is the post-80s, post-50s, and so on.

258
0:8:25,59 --> 0:8:27,32
Post-80s, post-50s, post-10s, and so forth.

259
0:8:27,32 --> 0:8:29,4
So, in terms of actual purchasing power,

260
0:8:29,4 --> 0:8:31,92
You see, I wear four white shirts every day.

261
0:8:31,92 --> 0:8:35,559
And five pairs of black shorts with black stripes.

262
0:8:35,559 --> 0:8:36,799
Then I change every day.

263
0:8:36,799 --> 0:8:39,579
You won’t even notice that I have 334 sets of shorts.

264
0:8:39,579 --> 0:8:40,809
And just one pair of shoes.

265
0:8:40,809 --> 0:8:43,29
So you see, I dress like this every day.

266
0:8:43,29 --> 0:8:44,769
Wearing flip-flops or sneakers.

267
0:8:44,769 --> 0:8:45,729
That’s pretty much my style.

268
0:8:45,729 --> 0:8:46,64
Riding a small electric scooter.

269
0:8:46,64 --> 0:8:48,16
My spending power is actually quite limited

270
0:8:48,16 --> 0:8:51,14
The main money should be spent on children's consumption.

271
0:8:51,14 --> 0:8:53,14
When it comes to parents, their spending power is also quite low.

272
0:8:53,14 --> 0:8:55,98
So, such people don't contribute much to the economy.

273
0:8:55,98 --> 0:8:59,6
You see, I could easily afford the Xiaomi 13 Ultra every day,

274
0:8:59,6 --> 0:9:0,88
but I insist on buying the BYD Dolphin.

275
0:9:0,88 --> 0:9:2,6
And it’s still the lower-end model.

276
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:3,54
It might even be second-hand.

277
0:9:3,54 --> 0:9:4,78
So that’s how it is.

278
0:9:4,78 --> 0:9:6,26
Actually, speaking of savings,

279
0:9:6,26 --> 0:9:7,34
the more you save, the better.

280
0:9:7,34 --> 0:9:9,8
The less willing you are to spend money, the more you feel it's being used up.

281
0:9:9,8 --> 0:9:11,82
Because you know once something is used, it's gone.

282
0:9:11,82 --> 0:9:13,53
Unless money can generate more money.

283
0:9:13,53 --> 0:9:15,93
In what circumstances can money generate more money?

284
0:9:15,93 --> 0:9:17,91
How should one spend their wealth?

285
0:9:17,91 --> 0:9:19,42
To acquire new wealth.

286
0:9:19,42 --> 0:9:22,88
How exactly should one maintain the lifestyle they had during school?

287
0:9:22,88 --> 0:9:23,66
Marriage life.

288
0:9:23,66 --> 0:9:24,4
Economic life.

289
0:9:24,4 --> 0:9:26,329
Look at this book of mine, it’s a must-have.

290
0:9:26,329 --> 0:9:30,89
Now you can visit Xiao Yinfu's conifer culture page.

291
0:9:30,89 --> 0:9:31,849
The authentic conifer culture page.

292
0:9:31,849 --> 0:9:34,67
It's the enterprise account of my little note.

293
0:9:34,67 --> 0:9:36,25
Head to his Douyin store and download

294
0:9:36,25 --> 0:9:40,74
Or you can search for 'Bikong Rongzhen' on Taobao.

295
0:9:40,74 --> 0:9:42,2
Bikong Rongzhen.

296
0:9:42,2 --> 0:9:44,56
Just writing 'Bikong' might not lead you to me,

297
0:9:44,56 --> 0:9:46,4
and just writing 'Rongzhen' might not either,

298
0:9:46,4 --> 0:9:47,88
but searching for 'Bikong Rongzhen' will find me.

299
0:9:47,88 --> 0:9:49,64
It's about the book 'Avoiding Pitfalls'.

300
0:9:49,64 --> 0:9:50,68
Shandong Publishing House

301
0:9:50,68 --> 0:9:52,78
This Jinan Publishing House is not the Shandong Publishing House.

302
0:9:52,78 --> 0:9:54,36
The Jinan Publishing House releases the B edition.

303
0:9:54,36 --> 0:9:57,89
But what you're buying now has this laser edge

304
0:9:57,89 --> 0:10:0,38
With that colorful and changing ink

305
0:10:0,38 --> 0:10:3,0
And also

306
0:10:3,0 --> 0:10:4,26
My autograph

307
0:10:4,26 --> 0:10:8,48
Buying this book is especially beneficial for those with insufficient knowledge

308
0:10:8,48 --> 0:10:11,16
Families with weak financial awareness

309
0:10:11,16 --> 0:10:12,68
Reading this book will definitely help

310
0:10:12,68 --> 0:10:14,1
Especially since you're not married yet

311
0:10:14,1 --> 0:10:14,81
Still single

312
0:10:14,81 --> 0:10:15,29
Haven't bought a house

313
0:10:15,29 --> 0:10:15,97
Just graduated

314
0:10:15,97 --> 0:10:17,1
It's a perfect fit for you

315
0:10:17,1 --> 0:10:18,65
It's particularly suitable during your college years

316
0:10:18,65 --> 0:10:20,76
Middle School Students might find it a bit premature.

317
0:10:20,76 --> 0:10:23,4
People my age might be too late

318
0:10:23,4 --> 0:10:24,109
So it doesn't really matter

319
0:10:24,109 --> 0:10:27,429
My core audience and reader base

320
0:10:27,429 --> 0:10:28,969
Are we talking about the post-90s or post-00s?

321
0:10:28,969 --> 0:10:31,48
So let's carry on with this topic.

322
0:10:31,48 --> 0:10:34,72
Actually, you need to hold your head up high.

323
0:10:34,72 --> 0:10:36,48
Because, you know, people in Beijing,

324
0:10:36,48 --> 0:10:38,36
especially old Beijingers, don't have as many wealthy individuals.

325
0:10:38,36 --> 0:10:39,8
Of course, there are rich people,

326
0:10:39,8 --> 0:10:42,86
but the less fortunate don't appear as wealthy.

327
0:10:42,86 --> 0:10:43,94
They love to show off.

328
0:10:43,94 --> 0:10:45,18
Particularly for some people,

329
0:10:45,18 --> 0:10:47,72
it's all about saving face.

330
0:10:47,72 --> 0:10:49,27
So he's willing to write.

331
0:10:49,27 --> 0:10:51,47
But in reality, for most people,

332
0:10:51,47 --> 0:10:54,45
Actually, there are quite a lot of people like me.

333
0:10:54,45 --> 0:10:56,13
In large families,

334
0:10:56,13 --> 0:10:57,47
There are more people,

335
0:10:57,47 --> 0:10:59,23
And they tend to do some basic work,

336
0:10:59,23 --> 0:11:1,339
Such people are really very numerous.

337
0:11:1,339 --> 0:11:4,339
Some may not have any descendants.

338
0:11:4,339 --> 0:11:5,92
Not everyone has a thriving family.

339
0:11:5,92 --> 0:11:8,72
Of course, there are also those who are only children of only children.

340
0:11:8,72 --> 0:11:9,4
They are all from Beijing.

341
0:11:9,4 --> 0:11:11,2
This kind of person will become increasingly wealthy.

342
0:11:11,2 --> 0:11:12,22
So in many cases,

343
0:11:12,22 --> 0:11:15,8
the choice of marriage and the inheritance of wealth later on,

344
0:11:15,8 --> 0:11:16,76
are directly related.

345
0:11:16,76 --> 0:11:17,72
How you choose your marriage,

346
0:11:17,72 --> 0:11:19,8
what your family structure is like,

347
0:11:19,8 --> 0:11:20,16
how many properties your parents leave you,

348
0:11:20,16 --> 0:11:22,49
that’s why there’s no such thing as a dowry among Beijingers.

349
0:11:22,49 --> 0:11:24,81
Because there is this material foundation, after all.

350
0:11:24,81 --> 0:11:26,17
So it doesn’t really matter whether there’s a dowry or not.

351
0:11:26,17 --> 0:11:28,13
If the couple has a harmonious relationship,

352
0:11:28,13 --> 0:11:29,19
they might even have a second or third child.

353
0:11:29,19 --> 0:11:30,61
But in such a scenario,

354
0:11:30,61 --> 0:11:31,73
they are considered the lucky ones.

355
0:11:31,73 --> 0:11:34,36
However, many people are not as fortunate.

356
0:11:34,36 --> 0:11:37,44
Those who truly bear the heavy burden of a mortgage,

357
0:11:37,44 --> 0:11:38,76
are also new Beijingers.

358
0:11:38,76 --> 0:11:41,94
But those who have the means to buy properties outright,

359
0:11:41,94 --> 0:11:42,78
are also new Beijingers.

360
0:11:42,78 --> 0:11:43,78
Not these old Beijingers

361
0:11:43,78 --> 0:11:46,66
So in terms of economic vitality, they are the new Beijingers

362
0:11:46,66 --> 0:11:47,86
Or you could say the newer Beijingers

363
0:11:47,86 --> 0:11:49,4
Because we refer to those born after 1949 as new Beijingers

364
0:11:49,4 --> 0:11:50,9
I call them new Beijingers

365
0:11:50,9 --> 0:11:52,18
Now they are the newer Beijingers

366
0:11:52,18 --> 0:11:54,48
But actually, new Beijingers should be counted from the year 2000

367
0:11:54,48 --> 0:11:55,6
Right?

368
0:11:55,6 --> 0:11:56,92
According to the period after the 2008 Olympics

369
0:11:56,92 --> 0:11:59,3
Because after that, there weren't as many people coming in

370
0:11:59,3 --> 0:12:0,14
So-called demolition households

371
0:12:0,14 --> 0:12:0,5
stock investors

372
0:12:0,5 --> 0:12:1,81
and people who speculate in real estate

373
0:12:1,81 --> 0:12:4,17
before and after 2008

374
0:12:4,17 --> 0:12:5,65
or you could say before 2015

375
0:12:5,65 --> 0:12:7,97
after 2015, there were two different approaches

376
0:12:7,97 --> 0:12:9,73
but everyone's perception is different

377
0:12:9,73 --> 0:12:10,66
so it doesn't really matter

378
0:12:10,66 --> 0:12:13,7
but I'm just saying, these so-called

379
0:12:13,7 --> 0:12:16,12
people often modestly refer to themselves as small-town problem solvers

380
0:12:16,12 --> 0:12:19,32
But actually, I want to say that the best way to speak is in Beijing dialect.

381
0:12:19,32 --> 0:12:21,12
How many graduates does C9 produce each year?

382
0:12:21,12 --> 0:12:23,4
How many graduates do the 985 and 211 universities produce each year?

383
0:12:23,4 --> 0:12:26,97
These true graduates from 982, 211, and C9 universities.

384
0:12:26,97 --> 0:12:30,17
The employees in these large enterprises.

385
0:12:30,17 --> 0:12:33,61
The excellent bosses of these cross-border companies.

386
0:12:33,61 --> 0:12:36,53
These local county Brahmans

387
0:12:36,53 --> 0:12:38,5
These people who come to Beijing to develop.

388
0:12:38,5 --> 0:12:39,25
They might have earned a lot of money back home.

389
0:12:39,25 --> 0:12:40,41
Then they come to Beijing to buy houses.

390
0:12:40,41 --> 0:12:42,61
Then, just like that, they become Beijingers.

391
0:12:42,61 --> 0:12:43,61
These are the new Beijingers.

392
0:12:43,61 --> 0:12:44,93
It's because of these people,

393
0:12:44,93 --> 0:12:46,97
who have injected new economic vitality into Beijing,

394
0:12:46,97 --> 0:12:48,32
not the old Beijingers.

395
0:12:48,32 --> 0:12:49,56
When it comes to the old Beijingers,

396
0:12:49,56 --> 0:12:50,48
their spending power

397
0:12:50,48 --> 0:12:52,0
and earning capacity are limited.

398
0:12:52,0 --> 0:12:53,8
Their salaries are only so much,

399
0:12:53,8 --> 0:12:55,31
and their pensions are only so much.

400
0:12:55,31 --> 0:12:57,47
He might have been affected by the demolition.

401
0:12:57,47 --> 0:13:0,75
But these people believe that those who truly made a fortune from the demolition are few.

402
0:13:0,75 --> 0:13:3,0
Among the residents of Beijing, this group is relatively small.

403
0:13:3,0 --> 0:13:4,2
Most are villagers.

404
0:13:4,2 --> 0:13:6,52
For years, due to household registration issues,

405
0:13:6,52 --> 0:13:9,34
they were at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder because of various reasons.

406
0:13:9,34 --> 0:13:10,58
These people have since turned their fortunes around.

407
0:13:10,58 --> 0:13:11,5
Is that right?

408
0:13:11,5 --> 0:13:12,7
So, to put it another way,

409
0:13:12,7 --> 0:13:14,58
we can say that the real turning point was in 1949.

410
0:13:14,58 --> 0:13:16,48
How should I put this?

411
0:13:16,48 --> 0:13:17,86
There have been some changes.

412
0:13:17,86 --> 0:13:20,98
This social stratum has undergone a tremendous transformation.

413
0:13:21,84 --> 0:13:23,23
This is the most significant change.

414
0:13:23,23 --> 0:13:25,59
But when we talk about changes in the economy,

415
0:13:25,59 --> 0:13:28,41
The change in academic opportunities came with the restoration of the national unified examination for admissions to general universities and colleges in 1978.

416
0:13:28,41 --> 0:13:29,77
In 77, the restoration of national unified examination for admissions to general universities and colleges took place.

417
0:13:29,77 --> 0:13:31,7
Many people are different now,

418
0:13:31,7 --> 0:13:32,74
So to speak,

419
0:13:33,18 --> 0:13:35,54
People often talk about the 1960s

420
0:13:35,54 --> 0:13:36,66
People from the 70s

421
0:13:36,66 --> 0:13:39,15
You know, last time a lot of people were hit hard

422
0:13:39,15 --> 0:13:39,99
and many got upset

423
0:13:39,99 --> 0:13:42,19
but actually, people from the 60s and 70s were quite fortunate

424
0:13:42,19 --> 0:13:43,13
they got university placements

425
0:13:43,13 --> 0:13:45,92
and they also caught the housing reform wave

426
0:13:45,92 --> 0:13:48,36
gaining their first batch of commercial housing

427
0:13:48,36 --> 0:13:51,6
they were right on the pulse of the times

428
0:13:51,6 --> 0:13:52,18
and things went relatively smoothly

429
0:13:52,18 --> 0:13:53,96
whereas the 80s generation might have had a tougher time

430
0:13:53,96 --> 0:13:55,21
Nothing was caught up with

431
0:13:55,21 --> 0:13:57,11
But the economic development of any country

432
0:13:57,11 --> 0:13:59,25
Always has a generation with relatively more advantages

433
0:13:59,25 --> 0:14:0,58
There is also a generation that is relatively more unfortunate

434
0:14:0,58 --> 0:14:2,42
But it's definitely not the majority

435
0:14:2,42 --> 0:14:4,0
Each era has its own outstanding individuals

436
0:14:4,0 --> 0:14:6,41
Each era also has its own general trend

437
0:14:6,41 --> 0:14:9,17
It's not that the majority of people in any era are a certain way

438
0:14:9,17 --> 0:14:10,21
So you are bound to be that way

439
0:14:10,21 --> 0:14:12,9
Nor are you destined to follow the majority

440
0:14:12,9 --> 0:14:14,55
But each era has its own mark.

441
0:14:14,55 --> 0:14:16,35
So when we talk about this, it is

442
0:14:16,35 --> 0:14:19,31
Economically and socially, those from the sixties and seventies are clearly more successful.

443
0:14:19,31 --> 0:14:21,48
But if we look ahead another decade,

444
0:14:21,48 --> 0:14:22,48
Another ten years down the line,

445
0:14:22,48 --> 0:14:24,4
When the previous generation fades away

446
0:14:24,4 --> 0:14:25,28
For this generation, speaking

447
0:14:25,28 --> 0:14:28,67
People from the eighties and nineties will become the backbone of society.

448
0:14:28,67 --> 0:14:30,19
There might be some new tycoons emerging,

449
0:14:30,19 --> 0:14:31,7
And things will be different again.

450
0:14:31,7 --> 0:14:33,79
So society is always moving forward

451
0:14:33,79 --> 0:14:34,759
Whoever speaks at this moment

452
0:14:34,759 --> 0:14:36,759
We often say achieving success before the age of 30

453
0:14:36,759 --> 0:14:38,119
Is actually not an easy feat

454
0:14:38,119 --> 0:14:39,539
Unless you're a prodigy

455
0:14:39,539 --> 0:14:41,659
Those who have a strong economic foundation

456
0:14:41,659 --> 0:14:44,73
But for most people, it might not be that easy

457
0:14:44,73 --> 0:14:46,89
So if you buy this book of mine

458
0:14:46,89 --> 0:14:49,49
You can see the various life trajectories of different people

459
0:14:49,49 --> 0:14:51,32
Why you want to take this path

460
0:14:51,32 --> 0:14:52,64
Do you have a path dependency?

461
0:14:52,64 --> 0:14:53,88
Take some time to think about it.

462
0:14:53,88 --> 0:14:56,89
So, many people, throughout their parents' lives,

463
0:14:56,89 --> 0:14:58,169
they haven't figured out their main purpose.

464
0:14:58,169 --> 0:14:59,809
Actually, you're already among the best.

465
0:14:59,809 --> 0:15:2,62
Think about it, you came from a very poor place,

466
0:15:2,62 --> 0:15:4,3
or a place with a smaller population,

467
0:15:4,3 --> 0:15:5,82
or an economically underdeveloped area,

468
0:15:5,82 --> 0:15:8,28
and through your own hard work and study,

469
0:15:8,28 --> 0:15:11,44
you've made it through the college entrance exam, which isn't entirely fair.

470
0:15:11,44 --> 0:15:13,67
In terms of this method of distribution

471
0:15:13,67 --> 0:15:17,17
you've also secured a top ranking in your province

472
0:15:17,17 --> 0:15:18,59
or you got in through the Strong Foundation Program

473
0:15:18,59 --> 0:15:19,94
various training programs

474
0:15:19,94 --> 0:15:21,26
you got admitted to Tsinghua or Peking University

475
0:15:21,26 --> 0:15:22,26
you got into the C9 universities

476
0:15:22,26 --> 0:15:23,54
you got into the 985 and 211 institutions

477
0:15:23,54 --> 0:15:26,65
and became a pillar of the community in Beijing

478
0:15:26,65 --> 0:15:28,73
you also want to stay here after graduation

479
0:15:28,73 --> 0:15:29,85
to live here

480
0:15:29,85 --> 0:15:30,71
So, to talk about it,

481
0:15:30,71 --> 0:15:31,43
there's actually no need,

482
0:15:31,43 --> 0:15:32,81
just lift your chest up,

483
0:15:32,81 --> 0:15:34,61
stand tall and proud,

484
0:15:34,61 --> 0:15:37,1
those people who act tough in front of you in Beijing,

485
0:15:37,1 --> 0:15:38,93
they're not really that many beneficiaries of demolition compensation,

486
0:15:38,93 --> 0:15:42,29
it's more of a sense of local survival crisis,

487
0:15:42,29 --> 0:15:43,65
in this regard,

488
0:15:43,65 --> 0:15:45,49
the feeling might be more pronounced among Shanghainese,

489
0:15:45,49 --> 0:15:46,93
of course, I'm not a resident of Shanghai.

490
0:15:46,93 --> 0:15:49,829
My relatives in Shanghai are all old Shanghainese.

491
0:15:49,829 --> 0:15:50,669
So when I talk about it,

492
0:15:50,669 --> 0:15:53,349
I might look at the issue from their perspective,

493
0:15:53,349 --> 0:15:54,509
but I might not see it as deeply,

494
0:15:54,509 --> 0:15:57,3
since I haven’t lived in Shanghai for a long time.

495
0:15:57,3 --> 0:15:57,63
It’s different.

496
0:15:57,63 --> 0:15:59,39
But I think from the perspective of someone from Beijing,

497
0:15:59,39 --> 0:16:1,27
the conflicts between locals and outsiders have been decreasing more in recent years.

498
0:16:1,27 --> 0:16:3,0
In the past, before Guo Degang became famous,

499
0:16:4,68 --> 0:16:6,72
There were still some contradictions in that era.

500
0:16:6,72 --> 0:16:9,22
But as time went on, through the generations,

501
0:16:10,94 --> 0:16:12,54
people became more and more different.

502
0:16:12,54 --> 0:16:15,39
People noticed that those with purchasing power were mostly newcomers to Beijing.

503
0:16:15,39 --> 0:16:18,57
Moreover, internet giants became increasingly powerful.

504
0:16:18,57 --> 0:16:20,47
There was a distinction between those in these companies and those outside.

505
0:16:20,47 --> 0:16:22,28
Compared to the locals, Beijingers relatively speaking,

506
0:16:22,28 --> 0:16:24,44
had a stronger capability in their jobs,

507
0:16:24,44 --> 0:16:27,8
compared to all those not from Beijing,

508
0:16:27,8 --> 0:16:29,56
in terms of the skill levels of those born locally.

509
0:16:29,56 --> 0:16:31,1
He must be hanging upside down.

510
0:16:31,1 --> 0:16:32,29
He definitely is.

511
0:16:32,29 --> 0:16:33,91
As they say, the latecomer often surpasses the early bird.

512
0:16:33,91 --> 0:16:36,59
So many people complain about Beijing, you know,

513
0:16:36,59 --> 0:16:38,79
or they have a sense of inferiority when they talk about it.

514
0:16:38,79 --> 0:16:41,24
But in reality, gradually, you become what you...

515
0:16:41,24 --> 0:16:41,88
You hate someone,

516
0:16:41,88 --> 0:16:42,88
and in the end, you turn into that person.

517
0:16:42,88 --> 0:16:45,46
It’s such a dramatic turn of events.

518
0:16:45,46 --> 0:16:46,98
For these people, it’s genuine.

519
0:16:46,98 --> 0:16:47,94
The pillar of Beijing

520
0:16:47,94 --> 0:16:49,5
rather than us old residents

521
0:16:49,5 --> 0:16:51,38
So our ultimate fate

522
0:16:51,38 --> 0:16:54,54
might be gradually moving away from the city center

523
0:16:54,54 --> 0:16:55,78
either to the suburbs

524
0:16:55,78 --> 0:16:56,54
or to other places

525
0:16:56,54 --> 0:17:0,8
gradually being washed away by the tide of time

526
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:2,0
Of course, I'm talking about the second economic choice

527
0:17:2,0 --> 0:17:2,98
Often

528
0:17:2,98 --> 0:17:4,7
you need to find a city that suits you

529
0:17:4,7 --> 0:17:5,78
Your wealth level

530
0:17:5,78 --> 0:17:6,79
How much money you have

531
0:17:6,79 --> 0:17:8,57
Determines where you should live

532
0:17:8,57 --> 0:17:9,47
If you don’t come back in the future

533
0:17:9,47 --> 0:17:9,83
When you have money

534
0:17:9,83 --> 0:17:10,95
You can return to Beijing

535
0:17:10,95 --> 0:17:11,79
Now that you don’t have money

536
0:17:11,79 --> 0:17:13,15
You should leave Beijing

537
0:17:13,15 --> 0:17:14,3
However

538
0:17:14,3 --> 0:17:15,84
Many people can’t accept this viewpoint

539
0:17:15,84 --> 0:17:19,24
Of course, what we're looking for is a comfortable and high-quality life.

540
0:17:19,24 --> 0:17:21,76
If you just want to have some fried dough rings in the morning,

541
0:17:21,76 --> 0:17:22,72
and a bowl of soy milk,

542
0:17:22,72 --> 0:17:24,12
then you should stay in the city without moving.

543
0:17:24,12 --> 0:17:26,599
But living like this is definitely not a high-quality life that comes from wealth.

544
0:17:26,599 --> 0:17:27,919
a high-quality life.

545
0:17:27,919 --> 0:17:28,519
Naturally speaking,

546
0:17:28,519 --> 0:17:32,9
people have different perceptions and feelings about this.

547
0:17:32,9 --> 0:17:33,49
So we say,

548
0:17:33,49 --> 0:17:35,85
we truly need to thank all the new Beijingers.

549
0:17:35,85 --> 0:17:36,77
Willing to stay in Beijing

550
0:17:36,77 --> 0:17:40,18
Willing to build this city with hard work

551
0:17:40,18 --> 0:17:41,52
It's actually quite challenging

552
0:17:41,52 --> 0:17:43,24
All your efforts

553
0:17:43,24 --> 0:17:44,96
Benefit everyone

554
0:17:44,96 --> 0:17:45,88
We all benefit

555
0:17:45,88 --> 0:17:48,87
The original residents should thank you

556
0:17:48,87 --> 0:17:50,59
If you've ever been in Beijing

557
0:17:50,59 --> 0:17:53,11
And experienced the pain of regional discrimination

558
0:17:53,11 --> 0:17:54,82
I apologize on behalf of everyone

559
0:17:54,82 --> 0:17:56,38
Because they don't know any better

560
0:17:56,38 --> 0:17:57,34
Don't stoop to their level

561
0:17:57,34 --> 0:17:59,55
They gradually faded away with the tides of time

562
0:17:59,55 --> 0:18:2,35
But many of the old Beijingers actually understand this very well

563
0:18:2,35 --> 0:18:3,71
They know it in their hearts

564
0:18:3,71 --> 0:18:5,489
Everyone works hard

565
0:18:5,489 --> 0:18:7,49
So I still suggest that older folks

566
0:18:7,49 --> 0:18:11,1
Even though public transportation is free for you

567
0:18:11,1 --> 0:18:13,8
Try not to travel during rush hour

568
0:18:13,8 --> 0:18:15,4
Don't inconvenience these hardworking people

569
0:18:15,4 --> 0:18:18,64
to take up people's commuting time

570
0:18:18,64 --> 0:18:21,76
but I know that some vegetables won't be available if you're too late

571
0:18:21,76 --> 0:18:23,36
you could go by electric scooter, right?

572
0:18:23,36 --> 0:18:23,76
if that doesn't work

573
0:18:23,76 --> 0:18:25,27
I can ride the electric scooter and take you along

574
0:18:25,27 --> 0:18:26,83
so many things are like this

575
0:18:26,83 --> 0:18:28,55
and many of the conflicts in Beijing's development

576
0:18:28,55 --> 0:18:30,11
such as the issue with license plates

577
0:18:30,11 --> 0:18:31,35
these are part of the era's progress

578
0:18:31,35 --> 0:18:32,55
a necessary phase of urbanization

579
0:18:32,55 --> 0:18:35,53
This thing has nothing to do with anyone.

580
0:18:35,53 --> 0:18:38,25
So, for any country's prosperity and development,

581
0:18:38,25 --> 0:18:40,97
new immigrants are needed.

582
0:18:40,97 --> 0:18:42,77
And among these new immigrants,

583
0:18:42,77 --> 0:18:45,12
Chinese immigrants,

584
0:18:45,12 --> 0:18:46,34
have the highest cultural literacy,

585
0:18:46,34 --> 0:18:47,8
and the strongest work ethic,

586
0:18:47,8 --> 0:18:50,22
so they are very hardworking and law-abiding,

587
0:18:50,22 --> 0:18:52,27
and they won't change the local culture,

588
0:18:52,27 --> 0:18:53,51
these are Chinese immigrants.

589
0:18:53,51 --> 0:18:55,3
Whether it's moving abroad,

590
0:18:55,3 --> 0:18:56,89
or to various major cities,

591
0:18:56,89 --> 0:18:59,28
this is a very powerful force in China,

592
0:18:59,28 --> 0:19:1,36
from a human perspective,

593
0:19:1,36 --> 0:19:2,22
the power of urbanization.

594
0:19:2,22 --> 0:19:3,94
So, thank you to all those

595
0:19:3,94 --> 0:19:5,98
who are willing to contribute to building Beijing,

596
0:19:5,98 --> 0:19:8,6
thank you for your contributions to this city.

597
0:19:8,6 --> 0:19:9,38
You are here,

598
0:19:9,38 --> 0:19:11,2
and you are the new masters.
