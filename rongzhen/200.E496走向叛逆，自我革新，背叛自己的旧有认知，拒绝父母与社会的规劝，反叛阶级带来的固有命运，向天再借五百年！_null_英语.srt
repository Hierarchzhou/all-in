1
0:0:0,84 --> 0:0:2,74
Hi everyone, good to see you all.

2
0:0:2,74 --> 0:0:5,64
My voice quality hasn't been the best recently.

3
0:0:5,64 --> 0:0:10,38
That's because I haven't been using my Action Five Pro.

4
0:0:10,38 --> 0:0:12,94
The recent drop in sound quality is understandable.

5
0:0:12,94 --> 0:0:14,76
I've been using my phone to record everything.

6
0:0:14,76 --> 0:0:17,0
I'm currently in Beijing,

7
0:0:17,0 --> 0:0:17,96
and haven't returned to Hangzhou.

8
0:0:17,96 --> 0:0:21,41
So, my G-Nan is not with me.

9
0:0:21,41 --> 0:0:23,17
Please bear with me, everyone.

10
0:0:23,17 --> 0:0:25,53
The volume will be a bit lower recently.

11
0:0:25,53 --> 0:0:29,25
But I'll try to turn up the sound in post-production.

12
0:0:29,25 --> 0:0:32,77
And recently, I've been slicing videos.

13
0:0:32,77 --> 0:0:34,43
Both groups are already full.

14
0:0:34,43 --> 0:0:37,379
I plan to launch the third group at noon today.

15
0:0:37,379 --> 0:0:39,139
Slicing videos is about to make a big move.

16
0:0:39,139 --> 0:0:43,19
Because I'm preparing for the publication of a book recently.

17
0:0:43,19 --> 0:0:45,13
Three books will be published in succession.

18
0:0:45,13 --> 0:0:49,29
Slicing videos on a certain platform is used for selling books.

19
0:0:49,29 --> 0:0:50,509
And if you join us,

20
0:0:50,509 --> 0:0:53,349
selling books now comes with very generous commissions.

21
0:0:53,349 --> 0:0:55,71
That means creating links for book slices to sell.

22
0:0:55,71 --> 0:0:57,29
It's a highly profitable venture.

23
0:0:57,29 --> 0:0:59,59
So everyone, let's get on board early.

24
0:0:59,59 --> 0:1:0,59
Start making money early.

25
0:1:0,59 --> 0:1:1,97
Achieve financial freedom.

26
0:1:1,97 --> 0:1:3,39
Even if it’s a bit short of the goal,

27
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:6,68
earning ten thousand or so shouldn’t be a big issue, right?

28
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:10,6
This item was previously under a licensing agreement.

29
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:11,58
Now that the licensing period has expired,

30
0:1:11,58 --> 0:1:13,54
everyone can freely create these slices.

31
0:1:13,54 --> 0:1:16,56
Of course, there are no restrictions on creating slices for Bilibili.

32
0:1:16,56 --> 0:1:17,5
When you create a slice,

33
0:1:17,5 --> 0:1:18,52
include the book's link,

34
0:1:18,52 --> 0:1:22,54
which is typically the most convenient method for optimization.

35
0:1:22,54 --> 0:1:23,46
In other words,

36
0:1:23,46 --> 0:1:27,14
if you participate in the slicing tutorial in our group,

37
0:1:27,14 --> 0:1:29,199
You'll get your first account.

38
0:1:29,199 --> 0:1:30,879
And you know, promoting products.

39
0:1:30,879 --> 0:1:33,79
Whether it's live streaming or video marketing,

40
0:1:33,79 --> 0:1:34,499
you'll understand the process.

41
0:1:34,499 --> 0:1:35,679
You'll be clear on it.

42
0:1:35,679 --> 0:1:37,9
This way, you'll embark on the path of self-employment.

43
0:1:37,9 --> 0:1:39,62
And it's even a zero-cost venture.

44
0:1:39,62 --> 0:1:41,54
So there's no loss for you.

45
0:1:41,54 --> 0:1:43,2
It just takes some time.

46
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:45,1
Let's start with a marketing promotion for everyone.

47
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:48,48
Then, in the next four episodes,

48
0:1:48,48 --> 0:1:50,52
we'll be chatting about the sheets,

49
0:1:50,52 --> 0:1:52,76
I want to talk about the path of rebellion.

50
0:1:52,76 --> 0:1:55,449
This is the first episode on the journey to rebellion.

51
0:1:55,449 --> 0:1:58,449
It covers the story of a prodigal son's comeback.

52
0:1:58,449 --> 0:2:0,9
There are four episodes in total.

53
0:2:0,9 --> 0:2:2,449
First, we'll discuss a particular MENTALITY.

54
0:2:2,449 --> 0:2:5,92
We're not talking about achieving great fortune at the age of sixty.

55
0:2:5,92 --> 0:2:7,22
That's not what I meant.

56
0:2:7,22 --> 0:2:10,68
Of course, Comrade Zhang Jiao, in the long river of history,

57
0:2:10,68 --> 0:2:11,9
has always been regarded as a bandit.

58
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:15,42
This is also a somewhat unfair assessment.

59
0:2:15,42 --> 0:2:17,76
This method of evaluation,

60
0:2:17,76 --> 0:2:21,74
because the biggest bandit in the Three Kingdoms was actually Liu Zhang,

61
0:2:21,74 --> 0:2:23,79
and people like Liu Biao.

62
0:2:24,339 --> 0:2:26,839
Zhang Jiao was truly more of a religious leader,

63
0:2:26,839 --> 0:2:28,999
and so were Jiping and Yu Ji.

64
0:2:28,999 --> 0:2:30,519
No matter what

65
0:2:30,519 --> 0:2:33,4
Actually, if he didn’t stir up trouble

66
0:2:33,4 --> 0:2:34,62
He could have lived longer

67
0:2:34,62 --> 0:2:37,629
But he had no choice but to cause trouble

68
0:2:37,629 --> 0:2:40,349
Why am I talking about this rebellious spirit

69
0:2:40,349 --> 0:2:43,469
Rebellion starts with yourself

70
0:2:43,469 --> 0:2:44,809
Not against society

71
0:2:44,809 --> 0:2:48,33
Or against the whole

72
0:2:48,33 --> 0:2:51,6
Or the overall trend, that’s not what it means

73
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:54,66
And embarking on a path of rebellion starts with defying yourself.

74
0:2:54,66 --> 0:2:56,16
It's not about betraying your conscience.

75
0:2:56,16 --> 0:2:57,5
Nor is it about becoming antisocial.

76
0:2:57,5 --> 0:2:59,39
It's about challenging traditional beliefs,

77
0:2:59,39 --> 0:3:2,2
and the self-imposed constraints you have.

78
0:3:2,2 --> 0:3:3,86
Taking the road less traveled, indeed.

79
0:3:3,86 --> 0:3:5,58
Speaking of the underdog rising,

80
0:3:5,58 --> 0:3:8,89
the underdog often ends up with a great outcome.

81
0:3:8,89 --> 0:3:11,1
Think about the earliest rebels.

82
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:12,43
Sailed towards the North American continent

83
0:3:12,43 --> 0:3:14,78
And eventually established a new nation

84
0:3:14,78 --> 0:3:16,1
Resisted the British Empire

85
0:3:16,1 --> 0:3:17,46
Regardless of how we look at it

86
0:3:17,46 --> 0:3:19,46
The outcome for rebels is often positive

87
0:3:19,46 --> 0:3:20,84
Because generally speaking

88
0:3:20,84 --> 0:3:23,51
When we talk about traditional Chinese culture

89
0:3:23,51 --> 0:3:26,37
We say that Confucianism is the least tolerant of defiance

90
0:3:26,37 --> 0:3:27,97
It emphasizes the hierarchy of ruler and subject, father and son

91
0:3:27,97 --> 0:3:31,9
Just like the song in Black Myth: Wukong says, 'No ruler, no father'

92
0:3:31,9 --> 0:3:32,96
No law and order

93
0:3:32,96 --> 0:3:34,62
The ruler and father are the law

94
0:3:34,62 --> 0:3:35,91
So, when we talk about

95
0:3:35,91 --> 0:3:37,83
In the new era

96
0:3:37,83 --> 0:3:40,39
Why do we need to emphasize innovation in our thinking

97
0:3:40,39 --> 0:3:43,21
Because we are now facing a clash of civilizations

98
0:3:43,21 --> 0:3:45,29
The clash of civilizations that Huntington talked about

99
0:3:45,29 --> 0:3:48,5
Now, there are several established civilizations in the world

100
0:3:48,5 --> 0:3:51,78
The Chinese civilization has been in opposition to the Western civilization as a whole.

101
0:3:51,78 --> 0:3:53,46
So it's a comparison and contest between individuals,

102
0:3:53,46 --> 0:3:54,3
between nations,

103
0:3:54,3 --> 0:3:57,1
and between societies.

104
0:3:57,1 --> 0:3:59,11
This includes both hot wars and cold wars.

105
0:3:59,11 --> 0:4:1,9
Many aspects are a test of strength,

106
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:3,5
a competition of lifestyles.

107
0:4:3,5 --> 0:4:4,75
We know there are comparisons like the one between Xiaohongshu and its counterparts.

108
0:4:4,75 --> 0:4:6,19
But more importantly,

109
0:4:6,19 --> 0:4:10,15
We can't be content with the current status quo.

110
0:4:10,15 --> 0:4:11,47
In many other aspects,

111
0:4:11,47 --> 0:4:13,68
our national defense capabilities have improved.

112
0:4:13,68 --> 0:4:16,24
When it comes to our economic structure,

113
0:4:16,24 --> 0:4:17,1
we have our own advantages.

114
0:4:17,1 --> 0:4:18,54
However, no matter what,

115
0:4:18,54 --> 0:4:22,3
if we don't start from a people-oriented perspective,

116
0:4:22,3 --> 0:4:25,22
we're not suggesting that you become antisocial,

117
0:4:25,22 --> 0:4:26,78
or that you defy conventional norms.

118
0:4:26,78 --> 0:4:28,46
Then, this traitor to the nation

119
0:4:28,46 --> 0:4:29,549
That's not what I meant

120
0:4:29,549 --> 0:4:33,109
This judgment is about judging oneself from within

121
0:4:33,109 --> 0:4:35,869
A judgment based on established norms

122
0:4:35,869 --> 0:4:40,56
It's about, for example, if we eventually leave the labor force

123
0:4:40,56 --> 0:4:42,62
And get out of the rut of earning a fixed salary

124
0:4:42,62 --> 0:4:44,9
And transform into a new entrepreneur

125
0:4:44,9 --> 0:4:47,39
This completes the path of a comeback

126
0:4:47,39 --> 0:4:50,41
Betting on the life environment you originally came from

127
0:4:50,41 --> 0:4:51,35
This kind of betrayal

128
0:4:51,35 --> 0:4:53,99
So we call this the Quartet of Rebellious Sons

129
0:4:53,99 --> 0:4:55,909
First, one must head towards rebellion

130
0:4:55,909 --> 0:4:58,589
Everyone can see that what's recently popular

131
0:4:58,589 --> 0:5:0,289
For instance, Nezha directed by Jiaozi

132
0:5:0,289 --> 0:5:2,73
For example, The Wandering Earth by Guo Fan

133
0:5:2,73 --> 0:5:4,61
Like if the name is mispronounced

134
0:5:4,61 --> 0:5:5,31
Don't get upset

135
0:5:5,31 --> 0:5:7,25
For example, Feng Ji, who specializes in dark kung fu

136
0:5:7,25 --> 0:5:10,9
For example, Zhang Yiming from ByteDance

137
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:11,35
All these people

138
0:5:11,35 --> 0:5:13,99
All of us who have become famous

139
0:5:13,99 --> 0:5:15,429
These entrepreneurs

140
0:5:15,429 --> 0:5:17,349
These cultural figures

141
0:5:17,349 --> 0:5:18,589
And how should I put it

142
0:5:18,589 --> 0:5:21,329
These cultural creators, in fact

143
0:5:21,329 --> 0:5:25,269
Firstly, the post-80s are quite happy to be part of the same generation as them

144
0:5:25,269 --> 0:5:27,69
But to be honest, the post-80s have had a tough time

145
0:5:27,69 --> 0:5:30,91
The rebellious spirit of the 80s generation isn't as strong as that of the 90s and 00s generations.

146
0:5:30,91 --> 0:5:33,17
But our generation is the one that started moving towards rebellion.

147
0:5:33,17 --> 0:5:35,289
And we are the generation that is moving towards maturity.

148
0:5:35,289 --> 0:5:36,529
We, this generation of people,

149
0:5:36,529 --> 0:5:39,89
whether they studied abroad or stayed in China,

150
0:5:42,629 --> 0:5:46,6
are experiencing rapid exchanges of ideas and information.

151
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:48,44
The rapid replacement of old knowledge means that,

152
0:5:48,44 --> 0:5:51,44
what we learned back then is no longer sufficient for today’s society.

153
0:5:51,44 --> 0:5:53,82
For instance, when I went abroad to study,

154
0:5:53,82 --> 0:5:54,74
In 2007 and 2008

155
0:5:54,74 --> 0:5:58,78
the internet in China was widely seen as declining

156
0:5:58,78 --> 0:6:1,3
it was filled with all sorts of negativity

157
0:6:1,3 --> 0:6:3,98
all kinds of things, including The Flowers of Evil

158
0:6:3,98 --> 0:6:5,6
these were the prevailing views

159
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:7,45
but after 2020

160
0:6:7,45 --> 0:6:9,39
especially in 2024

161
0:6:9,39 --> 0:6:11,11
many things post-pandemic

162
0:6:11,11 --> 0:6:13,57
have undergone tremendous changes

163
0:6:13,57 --> 0:6:16,19
Regardless of the public opinion field or people's fundamental thinking

164
0:6:16,19 --> 0:6:18,39
it's simply a different generation

165
0:6:18,39 --> 0:6:19,11
the post-70s

166
0:6:19,11 --> 0:6:19,99
now the post-60s

167
0:6:19,99 --> 0:6:22,39
have already stepped down from the main arena of the public opinion field

168
0:6:22,39 --> 0:6:23,73
they have already stepped down

169
0:6:23,73 --> 0:6:25,15
it's more about the post-80s now

170
0:6:25,15 --> 0:6:26,91
the post-90s are taking the stage

171
0:6:26,91 --> 0:6:27,45
taking center stage

172
0:6:27,45 --> 0:6:28,83
We're all in our forties now

173
0:6:28,83 --> 0:6:29,55
In our thirties

174
0:6:29,55 --> 0:6:33,599
So the core demographic of society has shifted

175
0:6:33,599 --> 0:6:35,699
People's ideologies have also changed

176
0:6:35,699 --> 0:6:36,539
Nowadays

177
0:6:36,539 --> 0:6:38,779
If it used to be slightly to the right of center

178
0:6:38,779 --> 0:6:41,24
Now it's more center-left

179
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:44,32
But whether it's more left or more right

180
0:6:44,32 --> 0:6:45,92
From a personal perspective

181
0:6:45,92 --> 0:6:47,1
Only personal development

182
0:6:47,1 --> 0:6:48,84
setting aside grand narratives

183
0:6:48,84 --> 0:6:50,2
is what's most beneficial for you

184
0:6:50,2 --> 0:6:50,76
So, let's talk about

185
0:6:50,76 --> 0:6:54,13
we say we want to deviate from a fixed path

186
0:6:54,13 --> 0:6:55,21
To start with

187
0:6:55,21 --> 0:6:56,98
what does it mean to take the path of rebellion

188
0:6:56,98 --> 0:6:59,64
it means you shouldn't be a compliant child

189
0:6:59,64 --> 0:7:1,669
don't always listen to your parents

190
0:7:1,669 --> 0:7:2,829
Above parents

191
0:7:2,829 --> 0:7:5,9
there is something established by usage in society

192
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:6,309
the educational system of society

193
0:7:6,309 --> 0:7:9,72
it will guide you and offer advice

194
0:7:9,72 --> 0:7:12,48
to mold you into a competent worker

195
0:7:12,48 --> 0:7:16,48
of course, if you follow the conventional path in society

196
0:7:16,48 --> 0:7:18,7
be a good child who listens to your parents

197
0:7:18,7 --> 0:7:20,58
be a, how should I put it,

198
0:7:20,58 --> 0:7:21,78
a good citizen

199
0:7:21,78 --> 0:7:23,8
You won't have any problems.

200
0:7:23,8 --> 0:7:25,539
You won't face any issues in this life.

201
0:7:25,539 --> 0:7:27,699
But now, speaking of the current situation,

202
0:7:27,699 --> 0:7:29,219
what we're facing is,

203
0:7:29,219 --> 0:7:32,85
even if there's a path, you can't walk it.

204
0:7:32,85 --> 0:7:34,97
we're up against this reality.

205
0:7:34,97 --> 0:7:36,97
For instance, your parents want you to get married.

206
0:7:36,97 --> 0:7:38,93
They also want you to have kids early.

207
0:7:38,93 --> 0:7:41,29
And society expects you to start working early.

208
0:7:41,29 --> 0:7:42,49
Get a mortgage as soon as possible

209
0:7:42,49 --> 0:7:43,49
Get a car loan

210
0:7:43,49 --> 0:7:47,11
Take all the money out of the bank and spend it

211
0:7:47,11 --> 0:7:49,43
Would you then have to take the path of rebellion?

212
0:7:49,43 --> 0:7:51,4
Would you listen to their advice?

213
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:51,46
Right?

214
0:7:51,46 --> 0:7:53,42
The Civil Affairs Bureau has a lot to say about many things

215
0:7:53,42 --> 0:7:57,16
Could you truly and completely follow their path?

216
0:7:57,16 --> 0:7:59,52
Not necessarily, let me explain to you

217
0:7:59,52 --> 0:8:0,54
Let's look at the Wealth of Nations

218
0:8:3,56 --> 0:8:5,22
You want to read The Prince

219
0:8:5,22 --> 0:8:6,38
Check these out

220
0:8:6,38 --> 0:8:8,54
Our Western Jia Xu and Machiavelli

221
0:8:8,54 --> 0:8:10,75
How he advises

222
0:8:10,75 --> 0:8:11,67
Advises you

223
0:8:11,67 --> 0:8:13,71
How to, how shall I put it

224
0:8:16,87 --> 0:8:18,56
How to cure the nobles

225
0:8:18,56 --> 0:8:20,52
How to cure the common people

226
0:8:20,52 --> 0:8:23,43
So in my last episode, I mentioned Comrade Musk

227
0:8:23,43 --> 0:8:25,59
the outcome might be quite tragic

228
0:8:25,59 --> 0:8:27,32
considering the historical context in China

229
0:8:27,32 --> 0:8:28,98
people like him often ended up tragically

230
0:8:28,98 --> 0:8:32,6
you can only use one faction of nobles to combat another

231
0:8:32,6 --> 0:8:33,8
have nobles from one region combat

232
0:8:33,8 --> 0:8:35,51
nobles from another region

233
0:8:35,51 --> 0:8:38,53
or nobles from one country defeat those from another country

234
0:8:38,53 --> 0:8:42,16
if you completely draw your strength from the common people

235
0:8:42,16 --> 0:8:44,24
Then, how do you defeat, well, let's say

236
0:8:44,24 --> 0:8:45,74
the existing interest groups?

237
0:8:45,74 --> 0:8:47,76
The outcome is usually not good.

238
0:8:47,76 --> 0:8:49,79
Especially when you use administrative measures.

239
0:8:49,79 --> 0:8:51,63
Once power is in your hands,

240
0:8:51,63 --> 0:8:52,41
you might take advantage of it.

241
0:8:52,41 --> 0:8:53,87
You might start issuing orders.

242
0:8:53,87 --> 0:8:55,27
But when you don't have authority,

243
0:8:55,27 --> 0:8:56,15
what are you going to do?

244
0:8:56,15 --> 0:8:57,75
You might end up on the defensive.

245
0:8:57,75 --> 0:8:58,89
It's like settling old scores.

246
0:8:58,89 --> 0:9:0,37
So, what's the root of all this?

247
0:9:0,37 --> 0:9:1,93
In our video, we don't mention these things.

248
0:9:1,93 --> 0:9:3,61
We don't talk about anti-marriage or anything like that.

249
0:9:3,61 --> 0:9:5,71
We're not talking about opposition or confrontation.

250
0:9:5,71 --> 0:9:8,13
We focus on the personal level.

251
0:9:8,13 --> 0:9:9,77
We discuss how you should break free from your own entrenched mindset.

252
0:9:9,77 --> 0:9:13,43
How should you betray your own entrenched way of thinking?

253
0:9:13,43 --> 0:9:16,97
We often say that we should listen to our parents' advice.

254
0:9:16,97 --> 0:9:18,29
But listening to our parents,

255
0:9:18,29 --> 0:9:21,34
we need to understand when it's right to do so.

256
0:9:21,34 --> 0:9:24,54
For example, if I come from a relatively wealthy background,

257
0:9:24,54 --> 0:9:25,46
a higher social class,

258
0:9:25,46 --> 0:9:27,56
my parents have arranged many things for me.

259
0:9:27,56 --> 0:9:28,62
He is his disciple,

260
0:9:28,62 --> 0:9:29,81
and his former officials are spread throughout the world.

261
0:9:29,81 --> 0:9:31,31
Following the path laid out by our parents

262
0:9:31,31 --> 0:9:34,23
Whether I attended an international school or studied abroad

263
0:9:34,23 --> 0:9:36,25
or stepped into the workforce

264
0:9:36,25 --> 0:9:37,86
my parents paved the way for me

265
0:9:37,86 --> 0:9:40,2
at that time, my parents had a high level of insight

266
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:41,46
I followed their path

267
0:9:41,46 --> 0:9:43,819
generally speaking, there wouldn’t be any major issues

268
0:9:43,819 --> 0:9:45,779
perhaps I might have been a bit rebellious

269
0:9:45,779 --> 0:9:47,419
my parents wanted me to study finance

270
0:9:47,419 --> 0:9:48,139
but I didn’t want to study finance

271
0:9:48,139 --> 0:9:49,1
I want to study physics

272
0:9:49,1 --> 0:9:50,7
What do my parents expect from me?

273
0:9:50,7 --> 0:9:51,62
Marry someone

274
0:9:51,62 --> 0:9:52,7
I don't want to marry him

275
0:9:52,7 --> 0:9:56,66
I want to marry a heiress from another industry

276
0:9:56,66 --> 0:9:58,83
As long as you don't casually take it down

277
0:9:58,83 --> 0:9:59,91
Typically speaking

278
0:9:59,91 --> 0:10:1,15
Your social status

279
0:10:1,15 --> 0:10:1,95
Your income

280
0:10:1,95 --> 0:10:3,25
In various situations,

281
0:10:3,25 --> 0:10:4,97
there won't be major issues.

282
0:10:4,97 --> 0:10:6,91
Many of the people around me are from the post-90s generation.

283
0:10:6,91 --> 0:10:9,6
They look for relationships that are well-matched.

284
0:10:9,6 --> 0:10:13,34
Or it could be that a golden phoenix has flown out of an ordinary nest.

285
0:10:13,34 --> 0:10:16,7
Or they might be an only child from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai region.

286
0:10:16,7 --> 0:10:17,82
This kind of issue arises.

287
0:10:17,82 --> 0:10:21,42
So when I look at the rich second generation among the post-90s crowd around me,

288
0:10:21,42 --> 0:10:22,62
the rich second generation tends to marry within their own circle.

289
0:10:22,62 --> 0:10:23,97
This is a very common thing.

290
0:10:23,97 --> 0:10:26,53
But what is the challenge for ordinary people like us?

291
0:10:26,53 --> 0:10:29,87
The issue is that your parents often become an obstacle to your social mobility.

292
0:10:29,87 --> 0:10:32,6
If they don't have money, they won't help you with a down payment.

293
0:10:32,6 --> 0:10:33,24
And they leave you on your own afterward.

294
0:10:33,24 --> 0:10:35,44
If they don't have money, they still insist you go ahead.

295
0:10:35,44 --> 0:10:37,98
They push you to buy a house or a car, insisting you get a nice car.

296
0:10:37,98 --> 0:10:39,38
They want to save face.

297
0:10:39,38 --> 0:10:40,54
When it comes to parents,

298
0:10:40,54 --> 0:10:41,34
Do you have any siblings?

299
0:10:41,34 --> 0:10:42,88
You need to take care of your siblings.

300
0:10:42,88 --> 0:10:45,34
Your parents insist on buying a house in the county town.

301
0:10:45,34 --> 0:10:47,98
Because they don’t think the self-built houses in the countryside are good enough.

302
0:10:47,98 --> 0:10:48,84
They feel it’s embarrassing.

303
0:10:48,84 --> 0:10:50,68
If I buy a house in the county town, there are many people like that.

304
0:10:50,68 --> 0:10:52,53
Or you might want to go abroad.

305
0:10:52,53 --> 0:10:54,33
Or you might want to get married a couple of years later.

306
0:10:54,33 --> 0:10:55,57
Or you might want to marry someone specific.

307
0:10:55,57 --> 0:10:56,49
Who you want to marry

308
0:10:56,49 --> 0:10:57,57
or how you are

309
0:10:57,57 --> 0:11:0,19
they will try to obstruct you in every way

310
0:11:0,19 --> 0:11:1,57
when it comes to such parents

311
0:11:1,57 --> 0:11:2,69
you need to rebel

312
0:11:2,69 --> 0:11:4,939
you can't just blindly follow your parents

313
0:11:4,939 --> 0:11:6,759
we say Chinese people should be filial

314
0:11:6,759 --> 0:11:8,339
this concept of loyalty and filial piety

315
0:11:8,339 --> 0:11:11,95
take the part about being filial and be cheerful

316
0:11:11,95 --> 0:11:15,37
But don't follow his advice and opinions entirely.

317
0:11:15,37 --> 0:11:16,99
Because when it comes to your parents,

318
0:11:16,99 --> 0:11:19,33
they might be limited by their social class.

319
0:11:19,33 --> 0:11:20,78
For example, my parents,

320
0:11:20,78 --> 0:11:22,34
I didn’t completely listen to my parents.

321
0:11:22,34 --> 0:11:24,3
The social class my parents belong to,

322
0:11:26,46 --> 0:11:27,94
where life is quite comfortable,

323
0:11:27,94 --> 0:11:30,54
affects many of their views and perceptions.

324
0:11:30,54 --> 0:11:33,2
They might see themselves as ordinary people.

325
0:11:33,2 --> 0:11:35,42
But in fact, the environment they are in

326
0:11:35,42 --> 0:11:37,22
the people they interact with are not entirely

327
0:11:37,22 --> 0:11:37,66
ordinary people

328
0:11:37,66 --> 0:11:40,66
from the real lower strata of Chinese society

329
0:11:40,66 --> 0:11:41,61
that kind of situation

330
0:11:41,61 --> 0:11:45,27
so some of their ideas are more idealistic

331
0:11:45,27 --> 0:11:46,99
more urban

332
0:11:46,99 --> 0:11:49,55
for example, they hope I take the technical route

333
0:11:51,76 --> 0:11:54,8
hope I can align with their goals soon

334
0:11:54,8 --> 0:11:55,64
Going in this direction,

335
0:11:55,64 --> 0:11:57,18
becoming someone's lackey,

336
0:11:57,18 --> 0:11:59,38
this is the best route my parents gave me,

337
0:11:59,38 --> 0:12:2,42
because they think this path is suitable in Beijing's environment,

338
0:12:2,42 --> 0:12:3,42
it's appropriate,

339
0:12:3,42 --> 0:12:7,8
but the issue is I'm an ENTJ with a strong personality,

340
0:12:7,8 --> 0:12:9,12
if you ask me to follow this path,

341
0:12:9,12 --> 0:12:10,48
I feel resentful inside,

342
0:12:10,48 --> 0:12:11,52
even quite distressed.

343
0:12:11,52 --> 0:12:15,369
Even at the beginning, I thought I was on the path of a strategist.

344
0:12:15,369 --> 0:12:16,209
That should be right.

345
0:12:16,209 --> 0:12:17,769
But later, reality proved that

346
0:12:17,769 --> 0:12:19,609
this approach actually limited my development.

347
0:12:19,609 --> 0:12:20,569
So, to speak,

348
0:12:20,569 --> 0:12:21,969
taking the unconventional path,

349
0:12:21,969 --> 0:12:25,92
not following the route of my parents, both civil servants,

350
0:12:25,92 --> 0:12:27,18
might be the right choice.

351
0:12:27,18 --> 0:12:29,22
Many people's parents, to be honest, are

352
0:12:29,22 --> 0:12:30,62
For example, if you come from the countryside

353
0:12:30,62 --> 0:12:32,96
university students may use discriminatory terms

354
0:12:32,96 --> 0:12:34,52
like 'small-town test takers'

355
0:12:34,84 --> 0:12:37,62
their understanding can never surpass yours

356
0:12:37,62 --> 0:12:40,99
they simply don't have basic scientific literacy

357
0:12:40,99 --> 0:12:43,55
nor do they have a modern sense of civilization

358
0:12:43,55 --> 0:12:44,97
or knowledge of social economics

359
0:12:44,97 --> 0:12:46,91
their understanding of the West's nearly 300 years

360
0:12:46,91 --> 0:12:48,83
compared to China's 5000-year history

361
0:12:48,83 --> 0:12:51,7
He has no idea how politics operates.

362
0:12:51,7 --> 0:12:52,82
He is even more clueless about what's going on.

363
0:12:52,82 --> 0:12:54,8
He doesn’t understand how society functions.

364
0:12:54,8 --> 0:12:55,58
He is completely in the dark about it.

365
0:12:55,58 --> 0:12:58,78
You are already the pinnacle of intelligence and experience in your family.

366
0:12:58,78 --> 0:13:0,12
So you should listen to them.

367
0:13:0,12 --> 0:13:1,84
You should take the filial piety route.

368
0:13:1,84 --> 0:13:2,92
The way of ruler and minister, father and son.

369
0:13:2,92 --> 0:13:5,46
You will surely find yourself increasingly isolated.

370
0:13:5,46 --> 0:13:7,18
Including many UPloaders around me

371
0:13:7,18 --> 0:13:9,92
they encounter some issues

372
0:13:10,4 --> 0:13:12,92
like being pressured to get married during the Spring Festival

373
0:13:12,92 --> 0:13:16,8
or being urged to have children, even though they've already made it as UPloaders

374
0:13:16,8 --> 0:13:18,15
but their parents hope they’ll come home and provide for the family

375
0:13:18,15 --> 0:13:19,99
they have no idea how much you earn

376
0:13:19,99 --> 0:13:22,15
or what your current social status is

377
0:13:22,15 --> 0:13:24,32
or what the current social reality is

378
0:13:24,32 --> 0:13:26,46
and then they force you to take on loans

379
0:13:26,46 --> 0:13:28,72
When house prices have already started to decline,

380
0:13:28,72 --> 0:13:30,7
it’s asking you to buy a ready-made house,

381
0:13:30,7 --> 0:13:32,32
which is simply courting disaster.

382
0:13:32,32 --> 0:13:35,1
In China, only the top 20 cities

383
0:13:35,1 --> 0:13:36,4
have the agglomeration effect,

384
0:13:36,4 --> 0:13:38,9
where property prices won’t plummet.

385
0:13:38,9 --> 0:13:41,51
But let’s not even talk about the county towns.

386
0:13:41,51 --> 0:13:41,95
Alright,

387
0:13:41,95 --> 0:13:43,85
we’re in 2025 now.

388
0:13:43,85 --> 0:13:47,5
Let's not talk about the housing demand in the county still not being met.

389
0:13:47,5 --> 0:13:47,53
Alright?

390
0:13:47,53 --> 0:13:48,5
Isn't that right?

391
0:13:48,5 --> 0:13:49,25
Who are we trying to fool?

392
0:13:49,25 --> 0:13:50,69
So, in many cases,

393
0:13:50,69 --> 0:13:52,81
if you want to achieve financial independence,

394
0:13:52,81 --> 0:13:56,75
if you want to achieve true independence in society,

395
0:13:56,75 --> 0:13:58,95
you first need to take a path of rebellion.

396
0:13:58,95 --> 0:14:2,24
Rebellion starts with rebelling against yourself.

397
0:14:2,24 --> 0:14:4,36
It's about the social class your parents come from

398
0:14:4,36 --> 0:14:6,28
This judgment is based on such perceptions

399
0:14:6,28 --> 0:14:8,5
You are, in fact, a product of your parents

400
0:14:8,5 --> 0:14:10,6
Much of your understanding comes from your parents

401
0:14:10,6 --> 0:14:12,31
Your parents often directly interfere with you

402
0:14:12,31 --> 0:14:13,35
In many cases

403
0:14:13,35 --> 0:14:14,75
They hope you'll be an obedient child

404
0:14:14,75 --> 0:14:15,97
But when you are obedient

405
0:14:15,97 --> 0:14:19,35
Ultimately, it maximizes their own interests

406
0:14:19,35 --> 0:14:23,26
Your life is about being chosen, being selected.

407
0:14:23,26 --> 0:14:26,7
It's a life that has been picked and optimized.

408
0:14:26,7 --> 0:14:28,4
Because for them,

409
0:14:28,4 --> 0:14:30,82
the fear of death is immense.

410
0:14:30,82 --> 0:14:31,96
Having you bear a child

411
0:14:31,96 --> 0:14:34,33
ensures their retirement is secure.

412
0:14:34,33 --> 0:14:36,79
Once you truly have descendants,

413
0:14:36,79 --> 0:14:38,73
your own benefits can be maximized.

414
0:14:38,73 --> 0:14:40,11
People, relatively speaking,

415
0:14:40,11 --> 0:14:43,65
You might always say it’s for my own good

416
0:14:43,65 --> 0:14:45,7
but in reality

417
0:14:45,7 --> 0:14:46,17
people are selfish

418
0:14:46,17 --> 0:14:48,9
you have a selfish and ruthless side too

419
0:14:48,9 --> 0:14:50,89
you also have moments when you neglect your parents

420
0:14:50,89 --> 0:14:50,969
at the same time

421
0:14:50,969 --> 0:14:52,929
you might have seen some video that

422
0:14:52,929 --> 0:14:54,649
makes you feel sorry for your parents again

423
0:14:54,649 --> 0:14:56,889
but it’s always a constant tug-of-war

424
0:14:56,889 --> 0:14:58,28
Your parents are people like that too.

425
0:14:58,28 --> 0:14:59,76
If your parents were really those kids,

426
0:14:59,76 --> 0:15:0,5
Go ahead and give it your all.

427
0:15:0,5 --> 0:15:1,96
Mom and Dad won’t rush you into marriage.

428
0:15:1,96 --> 0:15:3,6
They won’t care which city you go to.

429
0:15:3,6 --> 0:15:5,5
They won’t mind whether you stay in the country or go abroad.

430
0:15:5,5 --> 0:15:6,49
They won’t bother about what major you choose.

431
0:15:6,49 --> 0:15:8,15
Then your parents are just like mine.

432
0:15:8,15 --> 0:15:9,1
In that case,

433
0:15:9,1 --> 0:15:11,55
I suggest you try to be as filial as possible.

434
0:15:11,55 --> 0:15:12,75
Be kind to them.

435
0:15:12,75 --> 0:15:16,3
But never completely follow your parents' advice.

436
0:15:16,3 --> 0:15:18,38
That's the first step towards rebellion.

437
0:15:18,38 --> 0:15:21,8
Because you need to realize that there's a difference between you and your parents.

438
0:15:21,8 --> 0:15:24,74
How far you can go in life

439
0:15:24,74 --> 0:15:26,78
will determine how far your family can go.

440
0:15:26,78 --> 0:15:28,14
Regardless of whether you have children or not,

441
0:15:28,14 --> 0:15:29,33
regardless of whether you get married or not.

442
0:15:29,33 --> 0:15:31,95
You will be the pinnacle of your family in this era.

443
0:15:31,95 --> 0:15:34,81
So, when facing a complex and diverse society,

444
0:15:34,81 --> 0:15:36,74
you must first embark on a path of rebellion.

445
0:15:36,74 --> 0:15:38,38
You need to be the master of your own destiny.

446
0:15:39,38 --> 0:15:40,78
You should step out from the family lineage,

447
0:15:40,78 --> 0:15:42,66
starting a new branch with your generation.

448
0:15:42,66 --> 0:15:45,6
You need to understand that you will be the peak of your family.

449
0:15:45,6 --> 0:15:48,77
Your family will achieve social mobility through you.

450
0:15:48,77 --> 0:15:52,41
Therefore, the influence of the old family members on you will be minimal.

451
0:15:52,41 --> 0:15:55,23
You have, in terms of mindset, already completed the immigration.

452
0:15:55,23 --> 0:15:56,81
You have arrived at the new continent.

453
0:15:56,81 --> 0:15:57,97
You have moved to a new city.

454
0:15:57,97 --> 0:15:59,11
You have entered a new field.

455
0:15:59,11 --> 0:16:1,9
Here, you will be participating in new social competitions.

456
0:16:1,9 --> 0:16:4,49
So the help your parents can offer is quite limited.

457
0:16:4,49 --> 0:16:5,97
If you live close to them,

458
0:16:5,97 --> 0:16:7,25
and have them take care of your children,

459
0:16:7,25 --> 0:16:9,31
you will often have to abide by their rules.

460
0:16:9,31 --> 0:16:11,17
You might be bound to them for life.

461
0:16:11,17 --> 0:16:13,68
It’s impossible to completely escape their control.

462
0:16:13,68 --> 0:16:14,96
When you’re young,

463
0:16:14,96 --> 0:16:16,48
you should try to break free from their control as much as possible.

464
0:16:16,48 --> 0:16:18,26
Because when you reach my age,

465
0:16:18,26 --> 0:16:19,32
your parents’ health may decline,

466
0:16:19,32 --> 0:16:20,74
and you’ll need to be there to take care of them.

467
0:16:20,74 --> 0:16:22,58
This is the filial piety we Chinese value.

468
0:16:22,58 --> 0:16:23,98
But if you’re in your twenties or thirties,

469
0:16:23,98 --> 0:16:25,54
if you can't escape your parents' control

470
0:16:25,54 --> 0:16:26,1
that's not right

471
0:16:26,1 --> 0:16:27,82
returning to your parents' side in your forties or fifties

472
0:16:27,82 --> 0:16:30,48
that's a more complete process

473
0:16:30,48 --> 0:16:32,44
at that time, if you're willing to have children

474
0:16:32,44 --> 0:16:33,46
if you're willing

475
0:16:33,46 --> 0:16:34,74
after achieving a certain level of success

476
0:16:34,74 --> 0:16:36,1
if you're willing to stay with your parents

477
0:16:36,1 --> 0:16:37,3
that's your own freedom

478
0:16:37,3 --> 0:16:37,94
of course

479
0:16:37,94 --> 0:16:39,48
life is full of separations and reunions

480
0:16:39,48 --> 0:16:41,319
many times of coming and going

481
0:16:41,319 --> 0:16:43,619
but if you stay with your parents all the time

482
0:16:43,619 --> 0:16:45,159
you won't have a significant future

483
0:16:45,159 --> 0:16:48,3
so many people can return to their hometown to start a business

484
0:16:48,3 --> 0:16:49,81
but if you do it just to be close to your parents

485
0:16:49,81 --> 0:16:50,49
returning to your hometown to start a business

486
0:16:50,49 --> 0:16:52,49
you miss out on the opportunities in big cities

487
0:16:52,49 --> 0:16:53,83
if you start to settle for a comfortable life now

488
0:16:53,83 --> 0:16:56,14
in many cases, some opportunities

489
0:16:56,14 --> 0:16:57,26
opportunity costs

490
0:16:57,26 --> 0:16:58,3
time costs

491
0:16:58,3 --> 0:16:59,46
and financial costs

492
0:16:59,46 --> 0:17:0,849
you won't have them anymore

493
0:17:0,849 --> 0:17:3,169
of course, we say life is a journey

494
0:17:3,169 --> 0:17:4,609
all roads lead to Rome

495
0:17:4,609 --> 0:17:6,969
we often say if your background is

496
0:17:6,969 --> 0:17:8,9
relatively low

497
0:17:8,9 --> 0:17:9,51
you must understand

498
0:17:9,51 --> 0:17:11,8
if you come from a poor family, you should leave home

499
0:17:11,8 --> 0:17:13,72
if your father is weak, go into business

500
0:17:13,72 --> 0:17:14,76
if your mother is weak, go into business

501
0:17:14,76 --> 0:17:15,78
if your father is strong, become an official

502
0:17:15,78 --> 0:17:16,68
if your mother is weak, go into business

503
0:17:16,68 --> 0:17:18,94
if your father is strong, become an official

504
0:17:18,94 --> 0:17:20,66
so I've been telling you

505
0:17:20,66 --> 0:17:22,429
starting a business is your only path

506
0:17:22,429 --> 0:17:24,749
moving to a big city is your only path

507
0:17:24,749 --> 0:17:26,269
only by moving to a big city

508
0:17:26,269 --> 0:17:29,16
becoming a pioneer in an industry

509
0:17:29,16 --> 0:17:31,12
a content creator

510
0:17:31,12 --> 0:17:32,5
an asset owner

511
0:17:32,5 --> 0:17:34,69
can you truly rise above your current class

512
0:17:34,69 --> 0:17:36,39
in terms of assets

513
0:17:36,39 --> 0:17:38,17
in terms of income

514
0:17:38,17 --> 0:17:40,72
you truly become a new asset class

515
0:17:40,72 --> 0:17:43,42
you can stand firm in a modern commercial society

516
0:17:43,42 --> 0:17:45,5
because in a modern commercial society

517
0:17:45,5 --> 0:17:46,84
no matter what

518
0:17:46,84 --> 0:17:47,98
no matter how ideology changes

519
0:17:47,98 --> 0:17:49,48
how the structure of the country differs

520
0:17:49,48 --> 0:17:51,45
our economic conditions

521
0:17:51,45 --> 0:17:53,57
the laws governing our economic society

522
0:17:53,57 --> 0:17:54,85
are the same worldwide

523
0:17:54,85 --> 0:17:57,29
so to take the lead in the economic society

524
0:17:57,29 --> 0:17:59,21
you must take the path of turning things around

525
0:17:59,21 --> 0:18:0,78
that is, being a rebel

526
0:18:0,78 --> 0:18:2,16
taking the path of rebellion

527
0:18:2,16 --> 0:18:4,36
is the correct start to your life
