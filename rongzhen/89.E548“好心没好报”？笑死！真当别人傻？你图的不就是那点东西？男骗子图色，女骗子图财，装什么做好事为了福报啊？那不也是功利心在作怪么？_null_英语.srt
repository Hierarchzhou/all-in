1
0:0:1,14 --> 0:0:3,64
A person who is overly sympathetic

2
0:0:3,64 --> 0:0:5,4
is often considered useless

3
0:0:5,4 --> 0:0:6,8
Hello everyone

4
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:7,3
today is Children's Day, June 1st

5
0:0:7,3 --> 0:0:9,33
at 10:34 PM

6
0:0:9,33 --> 0:0:15,66
I'm at home, bringing you a new episode of the HaHa Bed Chat show

7
0:0:15,66 --> 0:0:16,8
So here’s the thing

8
0:0:16,8 --> 0:0:21,54
all those born before 2002

9
0:0:21,54 --> 0:0:24,72
are considered to be under 18 years old

10
0:0:24,72 --> 0:0:26,54
In my eyes, everyone looks like a kid.

11
0:0:26,54 --> 0:0:28,86
Of course, you were born after 2002.

12
0:0:28,86 --> 0:0:29,5
To me,

13
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:30,57
you're even more of a kid.

14
0:0:30,57 --> 0:0:33,3
Because something happened in 2002.

15
0:0:33,3 --> 0:0:35,19
I turned 18.

16
0:0:35,19 --> 0:0:37,97
So from that year on, I was an adult.

17
0:0:37,97 --> 0:0:39,13
Enough with the small talk,

18
0:0:39,13 --> 0:0:40,61
let's get back to today's topic.

19
0:0:40,61 --> 0:0:44,9
Don't pity others.

20
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:46,68
Those who elicit pity often have their own faults.

21
0:0:46,68 --> 0:0:50,58
If you're someone who others often need to rely on,

22
0:0:50,58 --> 0:0:51,28
a person in need,

23
0:0:51,28 --> 0:0:53,31
frequently asking you for help,

24
0:0:53,31 --> 0:0:55,67
then there might be issues with your character.

25
0:0:57,11 --> 0:0:59,609
Many people say I'm generous and kind,

26
0:0:59,609 --> 0:1:1,629
I actively help others,

27
0:1:1,629 --> 0:1:2,769
What's wrong with that?

28
0:1:2,769 --> 0:1:4,49
But let me tell you,

29
0:1:4,49 --> 0:1:6,309
When I talk about it a lot,

30
0:1:6,309 --> 0:1:10,86
There's a difference between kindness and true kindness.

31
0:1:10,86 --> 0:1:13,82
Why is there a difference between kindness and true kindness?

32
0:1:13,82 --> 0:1:15,89
When you do something,

33
0:1:15,89 --> 0:1:18,63
Many people's motives for doing good are,

34
0:1:18,63 --> 0:1:20,67
To go to heaven after I die,

35
0:1:20,67 --> 0:1:22,35
Or after I die,

36
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:25,67
These things can spare me from the suffering of the six realms of rebirth.

37
0:1:25,67 --> 0:1:27,35
I don't care about your beliefs.

38
0:1:27,35 --> 0:1:29,19
A lot of people have different beliefs, you know.

39
0:1:29,19 --> 0:1:31,41
But in the end, it's all about good karma.

40
0:1:31,41 --> 0:1:32,73
So I want to do good deeds.

41
0:1:32,73 --> 0:1:34,67
But this is similar to accumulating currency,

42
0:1:34,67 --> 0:1:37,47
or building up credit, really.

43
0:1:37,47 --> 0:1:39,39
It's still a form of utilitarian behavior.

44
0:1:39,39 --> 0:1:42,43
And when it comes to the motives behind many people doing good deeds,

45
0:1:42,43 --> 0:1:46,9
it's often shaped by their parents' influence.

46
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:48,45
So, tell him that doing good is the right thing.

47
0:1:48,45 --> 0:1:50,13
He's just doing what's right.

48
0:1:50,13 --> 0:1:53,96
He hasn't really made a choice in his life.

49
0:1:53,96 --> 0:1:57,25
Whether to do good or to do wrong.

50
0:1:57,25 --> 0:2:0,57
If we talk about the good deeds you do out of habit,

51
0:2:0,57 --> 0:2:2,99
It's a behavioral habit of yours.

52
0:2:2,99 --> 0:2:5,62
Or you were taught from a young age to do good.

53
0:2:5,62 --> 0:2:6,62
Fundamentally speaking,

54
0:2:6,62 --> 0:2:8,44
You're essentially no different from someone who doesn't do good.

55
0:2:8,44 --> 0:2:9,62
Do you know why I'm saying this?

56
0:2:9,62 --> 0:2:11,52
There are a lot of so-called good people in this world.

57
0:2:11,52 --> 0:2:12,87
They think to themselves,

58
0:2:12,87 --> 0:2:13,87
that they are doing good deeds,

59
0:2:13,87 --> 0:2:18,13
like releasing animals in places where it causes biological disasters.

60
0:2:18,13 --> 0:2:19,21
They do things like that.

61
0:2:19,21 --> 0:2:21,9
Many people think they are doing good,

62
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:22,22
helping others,

63
0:2:22,22 --> 0:2:23,12
engaging in poverty alleviation.

64
0:2:23,12 --> 0:2:23,82
Volunteering as a teacher

65
0:2:23,82 --> 0:2:26,22
Of course, I mean many people go to help with poverty alleviation

66
0:2:26,22 --> 0:2:26,74
To volunteer as a teacher

67
0:2:26,74 --> 0:2:28,5
It’s absolutely a good thing

68
0:2:28,5 --> 0:2:32,32
But I mean, a small number of people don’t have this mindset

69
0:2:32,32 --> 0:2:34,96
Their mindset is that they are good people

70
0:2:34,96 --> 0:2:36,5
So they want to do these things

71
0:2:36,5 --> 0:2:39,419
Or after doing this, ah

72
0:2:39,419 --> 0:2:41,99
What kind of rewards will I get

73
0:2:41,99 --> 0:2:42,699
Regardless of the moral rewards,

74
0:2:42,699 --> 0:2:44,319
it's also a form of having an agenda.

75
0:2:44,319 --> 0:2:44,919
You know?

76
0:2:44,919 --> 0:2:47,26
So, for a truly good person,

77
0:2:47,26 --> 0:2:50,25
the purpose of doing good is only one:

78
0:2:50,25 --> 0:2:53,13
to make human society a better place.

79
0:2:53,13 --> 0:2:54,71
This is an act of selflessness.

80
0:2:54,71 --> 0:2:56,7
Once you imagine,

81
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:59,35
for example, I do good deeds because the school will give me recognition.

82
0:2:59,35 --> 0:3:0,19
I'll be given a certificate.

83
0:3:0,19 --> 0:3:3,48
And I do this good deed because it makes me feel good inside.

84
0:3:3,48 --> 0:3:5,96
So, this is all a form of self-interest, isn't it?

85
0:3:5,96 --> 0:3:8,87
It's all about having a selfish motive while doing something public-spirited.

86
0:3:8,87 --> 0:3:10,7
Just like many people.

87
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:12,34
They have a strong sense of empathy.

88
0:3:12,34 --> 0:3:16,22
Having a strong sense of empathy can lead to significant issues.

89
0:3:16,22 --> 0:3:17,86
Because in this society,

90
0:3:17,86 --> 0:3:20,42
all kinds of people exist.

91
0:3:20,42 --> 0:3:24,78
People can't always be judged by their good or bad deeds.

92
0:3:24,78 --> 0:3:26,66
For example, some people love to take advantage of situations.

93
0:3:26,66 --> 0:3:28,29
Others are fond of cheating.

94
0:3:28,29 --> 0:3:29,629
Some have a strong aversion to injustice.

95
0:3:29,629 --> 0:3:30,989
And some are indifferent when it doesn't concern them.

96
0:3:30,989 --> 0:3:31,589
They keep it at arm's length.

97
0:3:31,589 --> 0:3:33,91
Thus, a variety of different values

98
0:3:33,91 --> 0:3:36,99
shape us into diverse members of society.

99
0:3:36,99 --> 0:3:39,83
And due to our different roles and responsibilities,

100
0:3:39,83 --> 0:3:41,25
Different levels of wealth

101
0:3:41,25 --> 0:3:42,53
Different social strata

102
0:3:42,53 --> 0:3:45,29
Have led to the diverse and complex nature of human society

103
0:3:45,29 --> 0:3:49,76
So many people who play the victim

104
0:3:49,76 --> 0:3:52,829
Are particularly skilled at finding hosts

105
0:3:52,829 --> 0:3:56,9
Once you sympathize with their pitiful state

106
0:3:56,9 --> 0:3:59,429
They will start to drain your resources

107
0:3:59,429 --> 0:4:1,23
Take up your time

108
0:4:1,23 --> 0:4:2,71
And disrupt your emotions

109
0:4:2,71 --> 0:4:4,83
So, in the end, to wrap it up

110
0:4:4,83 --> 0:4:8,39
It's often said that those who are pitiable have their own faults

111
0:4:8,39 --> 0:4:10,89
Many people actually don't deserve our pity

112
0:4:10,89 --> 0:4:12,87
Why do we say these people don't deserve pity?

113
0:4:12,87 --> 0:4:15,22
How should we approach this issue?

114
0:4:15,22 --> 0:4:17,2
It's about their actions

115
0:4:17,2 --> 0:4:18,82
When we look at their behavior

116
0:4:18,82 --> 0:4:22,23
Frankly speaking, when you consider it

117
0:4:22,23 --> 0:4:24,25
You might feel that they are complaining to you

118
0:4:24,25 --> 0:4:26,43
You think it's necessary to stand by him

119
0:4:26,43 --> 0:4:27,63
But in reality

120
0:4:27,63 --> 0:4:30,93
Many people are not truly

121
0:4:30,93 --> 0:4:34,6
Honestly, they need to help many people

122
0:4:34,6 --> 0:4:36,16
He treats complaining like

123
0:4:36,16 --> 0:4:37,24
Like Xiang Linsao

124
0:4:37,24 --> 0:4:40,5
It's a habitual act of complaining

125
0:4:40,5 --> 0:4:44,34
Many people aren't really that miserable

126
0:4:44,34 --> 0:4:45,79
They just choose to endure it

127
0:4:45,79 --> 0:4:48,91
His purpose in complaining is to evoke your sympathy.

128
0:4:48,91 --> 0:4:52,15
Then, he tries to latch onto you.

129
0:4:52,15 --> 0:4:54,19
I see a lot of examples like this around me.

130
0:4:54,19 --> 0:4:57,32
As you all know, I have a particular fondness for this.

131
0:4:57,32 --> 0:4:58,94
I'm a person who enjoys being generous and kind.

132
0:4:58,94 --> 0:5:2,13
Right now, I have two such examples around me.

133
0:5:2,13 --> 0:5:4,77
Many people are truly pitiful, Qifeng.

134
0:5:4,77 --> 0:5:6,46
How would I put it?

135
0:5:6,46 --> 0:5:8,6
If someone is extremely pitiful.

136
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:11,24
I'll be giving you moral support

137
0:5:11,24 --> 0:5:13,8
and even material rewards

138
0:5:13,8 --> 0:5:15,44
but recently, the two people I've been helping

139
0:5:15,44 --> 0:5:16,74
let's not mention names

140
0:5:16,74 --> 0:5:20,94
you'll notice they turn to me when they're in a really low mood

141
0:5:20,94 --> 0:5:23,27
or when they're in a tough financial spot

142
0:5:23,27 --> 0:5:24,59
they always think of me

143
0:5:24,59 --> 0:5:26,27
so when they talk about it, they feel that Brother Rong

144
0:5:26,27 --> 0:5:27,11
look at how I manage to do it

145
0:5:27,11 --> 0:5:28,79
Then I came across this issue

146
0:5:28,79 --> 0:5:30,3
I also couldn't find a job

147
0:5:30,3 --> 0:5:30,55
What should I do

148
0:5:30,55 --> 0:5:32,15
And I faced a lot of discrimination at school

149
0:5:32,15 --> 0:5:32,71
What can I do

150
0:5:32,71 --> 0:5:35,43
You'll notice that when this person has the ball

151
0:5:35,43 --> 0:5:36,25
He'll come to you

152
0:5:36,25 --> 0:5:37,89
But when I'm short of money

153
0:5:37,89 --> 0:5:38,929
I go to Brother Rong

154
0:5:38,929 --> 0:5:40,209
I'll go and make a report

155
0:5:40,209 --> 0:5:41,369
Old man, drop some gold coins

156
0:5:41,369 --> 0:5:42,929
I reported and dropped some gold coins

157
0:5:42,929 --> 0:5:44,37
Report a few hundred bucks, right?

158
0:5:44,37 --> 0:5:46,85
Then after a while, I couldn't find a job again

159
0:5:46,85 --> 0:5:48,5
Who can I talk to about my stress?

160
0:5:48,5 --> 0:5:51,16
A couple of days later, I found a boyfriend

161
0:5:51,16 --> 0:5:53,12
Then my mood improved

162
0:5:53,12 --> 0:5:54,82
And he'll forget about you right away

163
0:5:54,82 --> 0:5:55,74
Many people are like that too

164
0:5:55,74 --> 0:5:56,74
all day long

165
0:5:56,74 --> 0:5:58,78
like going out in cosplay

166
0:5:58,78 --> 0:6:0,1
often get criticized by others

167
0:6:0,1 --> 0:6:2,4
and all sorts of trolls come to bash them

168
0:6:2,4 --> 0:6:3,7
so they come to me to vent

169
0:6:3,7 --> 0:6:5,4
and I tell them that this is actually quite normal

170
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:6,7
you've actually been doing a great job

171
0:6:6,7 --> 0:6:8,12
and if you check back in a couple of days, you'll see

172
0:6:8,12 --> 0:6:9,54
Suddenly blocked you

173
0:6:9,54 --> 0:6:10,92
So let me tell you

174
0:6:10,92 --> 0:6:13,7
A lot of times, don't go out of your way to help others

175
0:6:13,7 --> 0:6:14,7
Because when you help someone

176
0:6:14,7 --> 0:6:15,78
After you've helped them with good intentions

177
0:6:15,78 --> 0:6:18,45
It might leave you feeling really upset

178
0:6:18,45 --> 0:6:19,25
Do things

179
0:6:19,25 --> 0:6:20,49
But when I do these things

180
0:6:20,49 --> 0:6:22,45
Why did I get used to it long ago

181
0:6:22,45 --> 0:6:24,21
I've supported more than just one or two people.

182
0:6:24,21 --> 0:6:27,31
Actually, I've supported around a dozen or so.

183
0:6:27,31 --> 0:6:28,73
Quite a few people.

184
0:6:28,73 --> 0:6:30,61
It's not like I provide massive support.

185
0:6:30,61 --> 0:6:32,9
I don't just give them tens of thousands of dollars.

186
0:6:32,9 --> 0:6:32,93
It's not like that.

187
0:6:32,93 --> 0:6:35,41
Many of them do come from families in real need.

188
0:6:35,41 --> 0:6:37,67
Or they might be recent college graduates struggling to find a job.

189
0:6:37,67 --> 0:6:38,63
Or something along those lines.

190
0:6:38,63 --> 0:6:39,71
Really, they did come to see me.

191
0:6:39,71 --> 0:6:40,59
Of course, I also consider the situation.

192
0:6:40,59 --> 0:6:41,99
I'm not saying I help everyone.

193
0:6:41,99 --> 0:6:44,24
Anyway, I definitely help those who are good-looking, right?

194
0:6:44,24 --> 0:6:45,72
That thing is definitely like that.

195
0:6:45,72 --> 0:6:48,52
So you'll notice that these people know to come to you.

196
0:6:48,52 --> 0:6:50,8
You would agree, wouldn't you?

197
0:6:50,8 --> 0:6:51,2
So many times,

198
0:6:51,2 --> 0:6:52,52
And when a lot of people talk about it,

199
0:6:52,52 --> 0:6:54,479
I couldn’t really talk to you much at first

200
0:6:54,479 --> 0:6:55,759
but then I found out you gave him money

201
0:6:55,759 --> 0:6:55,919
Oh

202
0:6:55,919 --> 0:6:56,879
he just comes over to chat with you whenever he has nothing to do

203
0:6:56,879 --> 0:6:58,859
the truth is, he’s just trying to get money from you

204
0:6:58,859 --> 0:6:59,96
it’s that simple

205
0:6:59,96 --> 0:7:3,4
so many times when you do something out of kindness

206
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:4,36
you feel sorry for him

207
0:7:4,36 --> 0:7:5,909
but when he really needs you, it’s not like that

208
0:7:5,909 --> 0:7:6,949
I'm very clear in my mind

209
0:7:6,949 --> 0:7:8,469
what this kind of person needs me for

210
0:7:8,469 --> 0:7:11,42
it's because no one pays attention to him at this time

211
0:7:11,78 --> 0:7:13,86
normal people wouldn't bother with him

212
0:7:13,86 --> 0:7:15,94
he actually went online to find someone

213
0:7:15,94 --> 0:7:19,95
an old man who has nothing to do with his life to complain to

214
0:7:19,95 --> 0:7:22,99
which actually shows what kind of image this person usually has

215
0:7:22,99 --> 0:7:24,58
in his circle of friends

216
0:7:24,58 --> 0:7:25,62
many people would say

217
0:7:25,62 --> 0:7:27,18
Why would wisdom come to me to complain?

218
0:7:27,18 --> 0:7:29,9
Because he knows I would feel sorry for him.

219
0:7:29,9 --> 0:7:31,47
I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that.

220
0:7:31,47 --> 0:7:33,85
I’m not suggesting that everyone who comes to me for help

221
0:7:33,85 --> 0:7:34,77
actually has issues.

222
0:7:34,77 --> 0:7:35,59
It’s not like that.

223
0:7:35,59 --> 0:7:36,47
What I’m saying is

224
0:7:36,47 --> 0:7:37,99
if you are someone like this,

225
0:7:37,99 --> 0:7:39,71
when others come to you for help,

226
0:7:39,71 --> 0:7:40,87
Do you want to help them?

227
0:7:40,87 --> 0:7:42,22
You need to understand this.

228
0:7:42,22 --> 0:7:44,96
Because many people are not worth your help.

229
0:7:44,96 --> 0:7:46,96
Many people come to you

230
0:7:46,96 --> 0:7:48,56
Because they know you have a kind heart.

231
0:7:48,56 --> 0:7:49,44
You will help them.

232
0:7:49,44 --> 0:7:50,2
That’s why they come to you.

233
0:7:50,2 --> 0:7:51,16
This is where the problem lies.

234
0:7:51,16 --> 0:7:54,71
It’s about why these people ask you for money.

235
0:7:54,71 --> 0:7:56,38
Why did you choose to support him?

236
0:7:56,38 --> 0:7:58,6
Why did you choose to listen to his emotional issues?

237
0:7:58,6 --> 0:8:0,34
Actually, you have been putting in effort.

238
0:8:0,34 --> 0:8:1,2
Do you know that?

239
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:2,34
You would go to such lengths to help him.

240
0:8:2,34 --> 0:8:4,8
You would give without expecting anything in return.

241
0:8:4,8 --> 0:8:5,9
So, from his perspective,

242
0:8:5,9 --> 0:8:8,929
you are someone he can take advantage of and bully.

243
0:8:8,929 --> 0:8:9,969
Of course, speaking of it,

244
0:8:9,969 --> 0:8:11,889
I’m not just being used for nothing.

245
0:8:11,889 --> 0:8:13,129
I’m not just being bullied for nothing.

246
0:8:13,129 --> 0:8:14,329
I have my own agenda, you know.

247
0:8:14,329 --> 0:8:14,609
Right?

248
0:8:14,609 --> 0:8:15,289
I have my own plans.

249
0:8:15,289 --> 0:8:16,89
That’s perfectly normal.

250
0:8:16,89 --> 0:8:18,29
If you want to get one point from me,

251
0:8:18,29 --> 0:8:20,9
I’ll make sure to get three points back from you.

252
0:8:20,9 --> 0:8:21,9
If you want to get five points,

253
0:8:21,9 --> 0:8:22,5
I'll get a perfect score

254
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:23,35
That's just how it is

255
0:8:23,35 --> 0:8:24,87
So for me

256
0:8:24,87 --> 0:8:27,33
Doing good deeds is often an investment

257
0:8:27,33 --> 0:8:28,58
For an investment

258
0:8:28,58 --> 0:8:30,82
It's not that I'm easy to take advantage of or anything

259
0:8:30,82 --> 0:8:32,72
But many people will interpret it differently

260
0:8:32,72 --> 0:8:33,34
Let me tell you

261
0:8:33,34 --> 0:8:34,5
That's human nature

262
0:8:34,5 --> 0:8:36,779
Many people seem pitiful when you look at them.

263
0:8:36,779 --> 0:8:38,339
It’s not easy for them, being ostracized by others.

264
0:8:38,339 --> 0:8:40,819
But you need to understand why they are being ostracized.

265
0:8:40,819 --> 0:8:42,139
Why is he in such a sorry state?

266
0:8:42,139 --> 0:8:43,45
How did it come to this?

267
0:8:43,45 --> 0:8:45,29
Why does he have so few friends his age?

268
0:8:45,29 --> 0:8:47,3
He has to go online to find a stranger,

269
0:8:47,3 --> 0:8:49,82
someone completely unrelated, to talk about these things.

270
0:8:49,82 --> 0:8:51,66
What do you think of his character in everyday life?

271
0:8:51,66 --> 0:8:53,2
When it comes to the reality of it

272
0:8:53,2 --> 0:8:54,6
Is it the same as he describes?

273
0:8:54,6 --> 0:8:57,109
So many people are very good at playing the victim

274
0:8:57,109 --> 0:8:59,569
Many people are very skilled at exploiting others' sympathy

275
0:8:59,569 --> 0:9:0,949
Or taking advantage of others' kindness

276
0:9:0,949 --> 0:9:2,489
Once you've actually sent them money a few times

277
0:9:2,489 --> 0:9:3,749
Once you start treating them like a true friend

278
0:9:3,749 --> 0:9:4,669
When you actually need them

279
0:9:4,669 --> 0:9:6,329
You'll find that they're nowhere to be found

280
0:9:6,329 --> 0:9:7,629
Buy Bao has already blocked you.

281
0:9:7,629 --> 0:9:8,929
He hasn't paid you any attention for a long time.

282
0:9:8,929 --> 0:9:9,63
Do you know that?

283
0:9:9,63 --> 0:9:10,35
Let others tell you.

284
0:9:10,35 --> 0:9:11,71
She's found her happiness with someone else.

285
0:9:11,71 --> 0:9:13,23
Why would she need a crutch anymore?

286
0:9:13,23 --> 0:9:16,6
She's already regained her ability to walk.

287
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:18,0
She even has a boyfriend supporting her now.

288
0:9:18,0 --> 0:9:20,4
Why would she look for a crutch like you?'

289
0:9:20,4 --> 0:9:23,36
So, you people who always have a thing for young girls,

290
0:9:23,36 --> 0:9:25,92
you can actually learn a few things from me.

291
0:9:25,92 --> 0:9:27,92
When you help others,

292
0:9:27,92 --> 0:9:29,0
you must remember,

293
0:9:29,0 --> 0:9:30,8
if you approach it this way,

294
0:9:30,8 --> 0:9:31,42
without any ulterior motives,

295
0:9:31,42 --> 0:9:32,92
you won't feel bad inside.

296
0:9:32,92 --> 0:9:34,28
Of course,

297
0:9:34,28 --> 0:9:36,24
if you always expect something in return from the other person,

298
0:9:36,24 --> 0:9:36,84
More to say

299
0:9:36,84 --> 0:9:38,4
The other party isn't a fool either

300
0:9:38,4 --> 0:9:39,56
They also know you're helping them for a reason

301
0:9:39,56 --> 0:9:40,5
You have your own agenda

302
0:9:40,5 --> 0:9:43,79
So it's a case of one party willing to give and the other willing to take

303
0:9:43,79 --> 0:9:44,87
Once you invest

304
0:9:44,87 --> 0:9:47,1
You have to accept that there's a risk of failure

305
0:9:47,1 --> 0:9:48,29
Once you've invested

306
0:9:48,29 --> 0:9:50,99
You'll understand it's a mutual game of influence and control

307
0:9:50,99 --> 0:9:52,65
So, fundamentally speaking,

308
0:9:52,65 --> 0:9:55,4
your actions aren't really doing good,

309
0:9:55,72 --> 0:9:58,16
the other party is begging for your pity,

310
0:9:58,16 --> 0:9:59,98
he's taking things from you,

311
0:9:59,98 --> 0:10:1,9
and he's not doing good either,

312
0:10:1,9 --> 0:10:4,42
so what's wrong with a thief catching a thief?

313
0:10:4,42 --> 0:10:5,2
right?

314
0:10:5,2 --> 0:10:7,4
on the surface, he seems pitiful,

315
0:10:7,4 --> 0:10:9,9
and it looks like you're willing to help the unfortunate.

316
0:10:9,9 --> 0:10:10,7
Neither of you is wrong

317
0:10:10,7 --> 0:10:11,83
Both of you are good people

318
0:10:11,83 --> 0:10:15,41
That's why many guys are willing to help girls for free

319
0:10:15,41 --> 0:10:17,93
Is your real intention to help him?

320
0:10:17,93 --> 0:10:19,57
Is your intention to be kind-hearted?

321
0:10:19,57 --> 0:10:22,7
Isn't it still about that thing?

322
0:10:22,7 --> 0:10:26,76
So, if you separate certain things from sex

323
0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:28,4
This has nothing to do with sex

324
0:10:28,4 --> 0:10:29,64
I think that's all unreliable

325
0:10:29,64 --> 0:10:30,8
So, in many cases,

326
0:10:30,8 --> 0:10:32,66
we say people have an agenda,

327
0:10:32,66 --> 0:10:34,24
once you have an agenda,

328
0:10:34,24 --> 0:10:35,78
you're not doing good for its own sake,

329
0:10:35,78 --> 0:10:38,7
you're making a purposeful investment.

330
0:10:38,7 --> 0:10:40,79
I know that my actions are driven by an agenda,

331
0:10:40,79 --> 0:10:42,67
I consider this to be an investment.

332
0:10:42,67 --> 0:10:43,89
But for me,

333
0:10:43,89 --> 0:10:45,37
helping 100 people

334
0:10:45,37 --> 0:10:47,16
33 people betrayed me

335
0:10:47,16 --> 0:10:49,6
About 50 people later went silent

336
0:10:49,6 --> 0:10:50,2
There could be a dozen or so

337
0:10:50,2 --> 0:10:50,8
Twenty or so

338
0:10:50,8 --> 0:10:52,88
It’s already good if this person can show gratitude

339
0:10:52,88 --> 0:10:53,48
To me

340
0:10:53,48 --> 0:10:55,12
This is an issue of return on investment

341
0:10:55,12 --> 0:10:57,869
So for me, it’s a numbers game

342
0:10:57,869 --> 0:10:58,809
Of course

343
0:10:58,809 --> 0:11:0,85
If you come across such a freeloader,

344
0:11:0,85 --> 0:11:2,29
you'd be pretty upset too,

345
0:11:2,29 --> 0:11:3,33
but that's just how it is.

346
0:11:3,33 --> 0:11:4,47
Even the landlord has no surplus grain.

347
0:11:4,47 --> 0:11:5,86
In many cases,

348
0:11:5,86 --> 0:11:8,3
when it comes to the behavior of such people,

349
0:11:8,3 --> 0:11:9,16
you need to understand,

350
0:11:9,16 --> 0:11:11,86
you should know that throughout history,

351
0:11:11,86 --> 0:11:12,58
men have deceived for pleasure.

352
0:11:12,58 --> 0:11:14,88
Scamming for money is always like this with women.

353
0:11:14,88 --> 0:11:17,36
They'll act pitiful and ask you for some money to spend.

354
0:11:17,36 --> 0:11:18,68
To them,

355
0:11:18,68 --> 0:11:20,28
it’s a process of honing their acting skills.

356
0:11:20,28 --> 0:11:24,63
But truly pitiful people generally won’t ask you for money, you see.

357
0:11:24,63 --> 0:11:26,27
Truly pitiful people internalize their struggles.

358
0:11:26,27 --> 0:11:27,3
They blame themselves.

359
0:11:27,3 --> 0:11:29,74
They try to find a way to take control of their own lives.

360
0:11:29,74 --> 0:11:31,22
And those who ask you for money

361
0:11:31,22 --> 0:11:33,68
Do you think others will only ask you for money?

362
0:11:33,68 --> 0:11:36,16
Once someone successfully gets money from you,

363
0:11:36,16 --> 0:11:37,32
they learn this trick,

364
0:11:37,32 --> 0:11:38,99
they get a taste of this easy success,

365
0:11:38,99 --> 0:11:40,27
and they fall into a dark path.

366
0:11:40,27 --> 0:11:42,55
They will move on to the next target.

367
0:11:42,55 --> 0:11:44,2
This person will realize,

368
0:11:44,2 --> 0:11:45,82
I can use my looks,

369
0:11:45,82 --> 0:11:47,48
I can use my body to make money.

370
0:11:47,48 --> 0:11:50,62
So this is one of the most interesting aspects of human life.

371
0:11:50,62 --> 0:11:52,88
Once he makes money from me in this way,

372
0:11:52,88 --> 0:11:54,16
once he makes money from men,

373
0:11:54,16 --> 0:11:55,98
he’s on a path he can never turn back from.

374
0:11:55,98 --> 0:11:57,24
Once you take it the first time,

375
0:11:57,24 --> 0:11:58,77
you’ll keep taking it.

376
0:11:58,77 --> 0:12:0,47
This is the essence of human nature.

377
0:12:0,47 --> 0:12:3,51
So don’t talk about these patrons of yours,

378
0:12:3,51 --> 0:12:4,89
how do you think you are?

379
0:12:4,89 --> 0:12:6,569
You're trying to impress others, right?

380
0:12:6,569 --> 0:12:8,369
Don't talk about the people holding that money.

381
0:12:8,369 --> 0:12:9,49
What do you think?

382
0:12:9,49 --> 0:12:9,889
These people deserve it.

383
0:12:9,889 --> 0:12:12,249
But in the end, money will corrupt your soul.

384
0:12:12,249 --> 0:12:14,28
It can corrupt a person very quickly.

385
0:12:14,28 --> 0:12:17,4
So, all of you who think you're doing good deeds,

386
0:12:17,4 --> 0:12:18,76
And not getting rewarded for it,

387
0:12:18,76 --> 0:12:21,72
You need to first understand what a good reward is.

388
0:12:21,72 --> 0:12:24,32
You're trying to take off someone's underwear

389
0:12:24,32 --> 0:12:26,48
So did you or didn't you take it off?

390
0:12:26,48 --> 0:12:27,28
If you did

391
0:12:27,28 --> 0:12:29,54
then you were making an investment

392
0:12:29,54 --> 0:12:31,73
so don't think you're doing a good deed

393
0:12:31,73 --> 0:12:32,71
putting in your sincere effort

394
0:12:32,71 --> 0:12:33,99
and the other person doesn't give you anything in return

395
0:12:33,99 --> 0:12:35,43
What is the return from others?

396
0:12:35,43 --> 0:12:36,9
Are they messing with you?

397
0:12:36,9 --> 0:12:38,0
Would you like me to stay with you while you sleep?

398
0:12:38,0 --> 0:12:38,46
Is that so?

399
0:12:38,46 --> 0:12:39,32
So, quite often,

400
0:12:39,32 --> 0:12:41,14
and others might have already done these things,

401
0:12:41,14 --> 0:12:43,17
then what you’re doing is a form of consumption,

402
0:12:43,17 --> 0:12:45,45
so don’t think you’re doing a good deed,

403
0:12:45,45 --> 0:12:46,73
if you don’t get anything in return,

404
0:12:46,73 --> 0:12:49,21
quite often, your efforts are driven by a purpose,

405
0:12:49,21 --> 0:12:50,36
so don’t do it like that.

406
0:12:50,36 --> 0:12:51,8
And when others speak this way,

407
0:12:51,8 --> 0:12:53,3
it’s also a form of self-defense.

408
0:12:53,3 --> 0:12:54,68
If he can swindle money from you,

409
0:12:54,68 --> 0:12:55,92
he can swindle money from others too.

410
0:12:55,92 --> 0:12:57,78
But in the end, he’s the one who will suffer the most.

411
0:12:57,78 --> 0:13:0,16
So what’s wrong with such behavior?

412
0:13:0,16 --> 0:13:2,4
Who among you is truly the bad guy?

413
0:13:2,4 --> 0:13:3,72
And who is truly the good guy?

414
0:13:3,72 --> 0:13:4,72
In the eyes of the heavens,

415
0:13:4,72 --> 0:13:5,76
Who among you is the good person?

416
0:13:5,76 --> 0:13:6,74
And who is the bad person?

417
0:13:6,74 --> 0:13:9,56
So don't think everything is about gender opposition.

418
0:13:9,56 --> 0:13:10,99
Everything isn't like that.

419
0:13:10,99 --> 0:13:12,45
The good person suffers.

420
0:13:12,45 --> 0:13:13,55
Good intentions don't always get good results.

421
0:13:13,55 --> 0:13:14,51
I pursue someone.

422
0:13:14,51 --> 0:13:17,51
So your pursuit has a purpose?

423
0:13:17,51 --> 0:13:18,41
So when we talk about it,

424
0:13:18,41 --> 0:13:19,77
At this stage of my life

425
0:13:19,77 --> 0:13:21,5
you might think it doesn’t matter much

426
0:13:21,5 --> 0:13:23,13
because after being let down so many times, it doesn’t really matter anymore

427
0:13:23,13 --> 0:13:25,51
you just end up judging the person’s character

428
0:13:25,51 --> 0:13:26,47
of course

429
0:13:26,47 --> 0:13:27,85
to be frank, it can be quite troublesome

430
0:13:27,85 --> 0:13:29,15
when someone really needs your help

431
0:13:29,15 --> 0:13:30,5
will you help them

432
0:13:30,5 --> 0:13:31,9
they might not be very good-looking

433
0:13:31,9 --> 0:13:33,78
He might not be able to give you any return.

434
0:13:33,78 --> 0:13:35,58
He might not even say a word of thanks.

435
0:13:35,58 --> 0:13:36,72
Would you still help him?

436
0:13:36,72 --> 0:13:38,44
If you were in that situation,

437
0:13:38,44 --> 0:13:39,72
would you still help others?

438
0:13:39,72 --> 0:13:41,0
And you don't expect anything in return,

439
0:13:41,0 --> 0:13:43,13
regardless of your reputation or loss,

440
0:13:43,13 --> 0:13:44,85
you would still do it,

441
0:13:44,85 --> 0:13:45,89
then you are truly a good person.

442
0:13:45,89 --> 0:13:47,85
But truly good people are not many.

443
0:13:47,85 --> 0:13:49,47
Most are good people.

444
0:13:49,47 --> 0:13:52,8
I can reap blessings when I do good deeds.

445
0:13:52,8 --> 0:13:55,44
I can gain a good reputation when I do good.

446
0:13:55,44 --> 0:13:56,8
Sometimes when I do good deeds,

447
0:13:56,8 --> 0:13:58,76
the sole purpose is for one day,

448
0:13:58,76 --> 0:14:0,76
if my reputation is tarnished,

449
0:14:0,76 --> 0:14:2,8
people will remember this and feel a bit more at ease.

450
0:14:2,8 --> 0:14:4,23
My public relations crisis,

451
0:14:4,23 --> 0:14:5,59
often works like this.

452
0:14:5,59 --> 0:14:6,51
Sometimes,

453
0:14:6,51 --> 0:14:8,329
my purpose for doing good is not pure.

454
0:14:8,329 --> 0:14:10,969
But this doesn't mean that if you don't have a pure purpose,

455
0:14:10,969 --> 0:14:12,89
you're not doing good deeds.

456
0:14:12,89 --> 0:14:13,589
It's a matter of percentage.

457
0:14:13,589 --> 0:14:15,249
So today we need to understand,

458
0:14:15,249 --> 0:14:16,569
in this world,

459
0:14:16,569 --> 0:14:20,44
purely evil or purely good people are rare.

460
0:14:20,44 --> 0:14:22,22
There are very few truly pure people.

461
0:14:22,22 --> 0:14:24,94
To be honest, many people do good deeds all their lives,

462
0:14:24,94 --> 0:14:25,54
how they fare,

463
0:14:25,54 --> 0:14:27,569
once you find out the truth about them,

464
0:14:27,569 --> 0:14:29,849
they might have improper relationships with many people.

465
0:14:29,849 --> 0:14:30,269
Right?

466
0:14:30,269 --> 0:14:33,489
Some people might seem to only look at young girls on social media,

467
0:14:33,489 --> 0:14:36,1
but in real life, they might be very simple individuals.

468
0:14:36,1 --> 0:14:37,33
So often,

469
0:14:37,33 --> 0:14:39,27
you can't judge by appearances alone.

470
0:14:39,27 --> 0:14:40,99
Someone who looks pitiful on the surface,

471
0:14:40,99 --> 0:14:42,63
might have a heart of stone.

472
0:14:42,63 --> 0:14:45,51
And many people just pretend to be weak and pitiful,

473
0:14:45,51 --> 0:14:46,339
or act cute,

474
0:14:46,339 --> 0:14:49,899
they've been doing this since elementary or middle school,

475
0:14:49,899 --> 0:14:51,66
figuring out how to scam money from men,

476
0:14:51,66 --> 0:14:53,72
but some haven't done it before,

477
0:14:53,72 --> 0:14:54,86
so when they do it for the first time,

478
0:14:54,86 --> 0:14:55,64
they find it quite satisfying.

479
0:14:55,64 --> 0:14:57,6
Some do it frequently,

480
0:14:57,6 --> 0:14:57,46
and they,

481
0:14:57,46 --> 0:14:58,74
are no longer interested in such petty scams,

482
0:14:58,74 --> 0:15:0,16
they aim for bigger targets.

483
0:15:0,16 --> 0:15:1,52
So when it comes to these matters,

484
0:15:1,52 --> 0:15:3,21
it's a game between men and women,

485
0:15:3,21 --> 0:15:4,61
don't take it too seriously,

486
0:15:4,61 --> 0:15:6,33
don't say it's all about love scams now,

487
0:15:6,33 --> 0:15:7,23
human society has always been like this,

488
0:15:7,23 --> 0:15:8,79
and it will continue to be so in the future.

489
0:15:8,79 --> 0:15:11,71
If you can't adapt,

490
0:15:11,71 --> 0:15:12,67
then you shouldn't stay in this human world.

491
0:15:12,67 --> 0:15:14,11
It's that simple.

492
0:15:14,11 --> 0:15:15,26
That's how simple it is.
