Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,14 --> 0:0:3,44
Chat about mattresses starting at 578

3
0:0:3,44 --> 0:0:6,51
A couple of days ago, I left a comment on my social media

4
0:0:6,51 --> 0:0:9,99
Then I found out that people's reactions were quite strong

5
0:0:9,99 --> 0:0:15,2
But no one really got the point of my comment

6
0:0:15,2 --> 0:0:18,0
Many people took it out of context

7
0:0:18,0 --> 0:0:18,9
Brother Rong

8
0:0:18,9 --> 0:0:21,92
You're someone who pursues fairness and justice, right?

9
0:0:21,92 --> 0:0:23,42
Because you like the Great Emperor of Genuine Prowess

10
0:0:23,42 --> 0:0:25,23
A couple of days ago, the Great Emperor of Genuine Prowess appeared to me in a dream.

11
0:0:25,23 --> 0:0:27,17
He said, 'You're doing a great job, kid.'

12
0:0:27,17 --> 0:0:30,4
He told me that I have the right to hang his portrait at home.

13
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:33,1
The Great Emperor of Genuine Prowess is a god of righteousness.

14
0:0:33,1 --> 0:0:34,88
Why do I need to say these things?

15
0:0:34,88 --> 0:0:36,94
It might seem so dark,

16
0:0:36,94 --> 0:0:38,4
so terrifying,

17
0:0:38,4 --> 0:0:41,9
but it's because I'm also a Machiavellian.

18
0:0:41,9 --> 0:0:44,56
The core premise of being a Machiavellian is

19
0:0:44,56 --> 0:0:47,3
One must not admit to being a Machiavellian.

20
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:50,5
From its inception, Machiavellianism has been

21
0:0:50,5 --> 0:0:52,74
criticized and condemned.

22
0:0:52,74 --> 0:0:57,36
However, it reveals a true principle in political science.

23
0:0:57,36 --> 0:1:2,18
When I stand in the darkness, yearning for the light,

24
0:1:2,18 --> 0:1:4,54
one person's dirt brings cleanliness to ten thousand homes.

25
0:1:4,54 --> 0:1:6,32
What kind of realm is this?

26
0:1:6,32 --> 0:1:10,1
Many people, lacking wisdom and possessing only a naive heart,

27
0:1:10,1 --> 0:1:13,24
cannot understand your motives.

28
0:1:13,24 --> 0:1:14,1
Of course.

29
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:15,88
Today, we'll continue talking about my social circle.

30
0:1:15,88 --> 0:1:17,28
I left a question in my social circle.

31
0:1:17,28 --> 0:1:19,46
I said, imagine you're the village chief,

32
0:1:19,46 --> 0:1:22,69
you have 100 loaves of bread,

33
0:1:22,69 --> 0:1:24,469
and you have a population of 100 people.

34
0:1:24,469 --> 0:1:26,74
At this point, how should you distribute them?

35
0:1:26,74 --> 0:1:31,6
Then I said, what you should do is use 10 of those loaves of bread

36
0:1:31,6 --> 0:1:36,74
to reward the top 10 most outstanding individuals.

37
0:1:36,74 --> 0:1:41,14
Then let these ten people divide up the ten loaves of bread

38
0:1:41,14 --> 0:1:42,98
How much he eats himself

39
0:1:42,98 --> 0:1:45,86
How much he gives to the other nine people

40
0:1:45,86 --> 0:1:47,6
That's his business

41
0:1:47,6 --> 0:1:49,64
But you're only responsible for distributing the ten loaves of bread

42
0:1:49,64 --> 0:1:51,8
And you need to keep ninety for yourself

43
0:1:51,8 --> 0:1:53,94
Then many people start to say

44
0:1:53,94 --> 0:1:55,92
Brother Rong, what exactly do you mean by this

45
0:1:55,92 --> 0:1:57,449
Why be so harsh

46
0:1:57,449 --> 0:1:58,409
That's so cruel.

47
0:1:58,409 --> 0:2:0,489
Why do you have to treat others like that?

48
0:2:0,489 --> 0:2:1,969
Why can't you be a bit more kind?

49
0:2:1,969 --> 0:2:3,25
A bit more forgiving?

50
0:2:3,25 --> 0:2:6,7
Have you played a game called Age of Weapons?

51
0:2:6,7 --> 0:2:7,91
Ah, Age of Weapons, that game.

52
0:2:7,91 --> 0:2:8,51
1.0

53
0:2:8,51 --> 0:2:9,73
What about 2.0?

54
0:2:9,73 --> 0:2:11,73
I played Age of Weapons 1.0.

55
0:2:11,73 --> 0:2:12,53
This game

56
0:2:12,53 --> 0:2:16,23
is said to be completed very quickly by Chinese players, ha ha

57
0:2:16,23 --> 0:2:18,87
because we have mastered an advanced theory

58
0:2:18,87 --> 0:2:20,5
Marxism

59
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:22,4
the distinction between productive force and relations of production

60
0:2:22,4 --> 0:2:28,339
and after many years of revolutionary practice in real life

61
0:2:28,339 --> 0:2:29,239
we have found that

62
0:2:29,239 --> 0:2:31,419
prioritizing the development of productive forces

63
0:2:31,419 --> 0:2:34,14
is the prerequisite for all stability

64
0:2:34,14 --> 0:2:38,64
So, in the early stages of playing this game,

65
0:2:38,64 --> 0:2:41,36
we recommend that everyone work overtime,

66
0:2:41,36 --> 0:2:43,46
strive to accumulate material wealth.

67
0:2:43,46 --> 0:2:48,76
Later on, the robot core will appear.

68
0:2:48,76 --> 0:2:51,829
Once everyone discovers the robot core,

69
0:2:51,829 --> 0:2:56,49
they can gradually replace human labor with robotic technology.

70
0:2:56,49 --> 0:2:59,47
At the same time, we have accumulated abundant material wealth,

71
0:2:59,47 --> 0:3:3,53
which allows us to use this wealth to advance technology,

72
0:3:3,53 --> 0:3:4,63
to conduct research.

73
0:3:4,63 --> 0:3:5,93
Boosting productive force

74
0:3:5,93 --> 0:3:7,61
Accelerating production efficiency

75
0:3:7,61 --> 0:3:9,79
Ultimately achieving uniformity everywhere

76
0:3:9,79 --> 0:3:10,69
Everywhere is full and rich

77
0:3:10,69 --> 0:3:13,36
So Chinese people not only don’t find this game difficult

78
0:3:13,36 --> 0:3:16,8
But they mostly achieve the best and excellent outcomes

79
0:3:16,8 --> 0:3:17,74
However

80
0:3:17,74 --> 0:3:19,3
Just like Western media

81
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:19,98
They would say

82
0:3:19,98 --> 0:3:21,94
But at what cost, right?

83
0:3:21,94 --> 0:3:23,2
But what is the cost?

84
0:3:23,2 --> 0:3:26,939
This is the core topic we're discussing today.

85
0:3:26,939 --> 0:3:28,259
The art of ruling.

86
0:3:28,259 --> 0:3:32,279
We often say sacrificing the small self to achieve the greater good.

87
0:3:32,279 --> 0:3:33,74
What is the small self?

88
0:3:33,74 --> 0:3:35,48
The small self is your individual personality.

89
0:3:35,48 --> 0:3:37,51
Your self is who you are.

90
0:3:37,51 --> 0:3:39,75
I want to achieve my personal goals.

91
0:3:39,75 --> 0:3:41,79
I need to maintain my emotions, both positive and negative.

92
0:3:41,79 --> 0:3:42,55
I want to reproduce.

93
0:3:42,55 --> 0:3:43,66
I want to procreate.

94
0:3:43,66 --> 0:3:45,54
I want to achieve my personal life goals.

95
0:3:45,54 --> 0:3:48,56
Regarding this trap of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,

96
0:3:48,56 --> 0:3:49,94
What is the greater self?

97
0:3:49,94 --> 0:3:51,8
For me,

98
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:53,46
the greater self is the me across lifetimes.

99
0:3:53,46 --> 0:3:54,36
The eternal me.

100
0:3:54,36 --> 0:3:58,47
But another way to explain the 'greater self' is that it refers to society, right?

101
0:3:58,47 --> 0:4:0,37
The greater self is our community.

102
0:4:0,37 --> 0:4:1,51
The greater self is ours.

103
0:4:1,51 --> 0:4:3,38
To put it simply, it's the Chinese civilization.

104
0:4:3,38 --> 0:4:8,68
The personal development of an individual and the collective development of a nation or race.

105
0:4:8,68 --> 0:4:9,94
Which one is more significant?

106
0:4:9,94 --> 0:4:10,82
What we mean by sacrificing the small,

107
0:4:10,82 --> 0:4:11,34
To achieve the greater good.

108
0:4:11,34 --> 0:4:16,409
To put it bluntly, it's a fearless spirit, both in public and private matters.

109
0:4:16,409 --> 0:4:17,769
But how to put it,

110
0:4:17,769 --> 0:4:19,529
I've always emphasized,

111
0:4:19,529 --> 0:4:21,929
I really hate idealists, you know,

112
0:4:21,929 --> 0:4:25,339
A couple of days ago, someone had Che Guevara's profile picture,

113
0:4:25,339 --> 0:4:28,179
Ah, a lot of good-for-nothings like to use Che Guevara's profile picture,

114
0:4:28,179 --> 0:4:29,49
and then started cursing at me,

115
0:4:29,49 --> 0:4:31,59
saying I use all Western stuff,

116
0:4:31,59 --> 0:4:34,49
and that my ideas are really unhealthy,

117
0:4:34,49 --> 0:4:35,65
that I'm corrupting the youth.

118
0:4:35,65 --> 0:4:39,44
Then, we should promote the idea of cutting.

119
0:4:39,44 --> 0:4:40,68
And similar medications.

120
0:4:40,68 --> 0:4:43,56
Everyone needs to come together and work as a team.

121
0:4:43,56 --> 0:4:46,759
Basically, it’s all about chanting slogans, you know.

122
0:4:46,759 --> 0:4:49,159
Actually, from a certain perspective,

123
0:4:49,159 --> 0:4:53,2
Idealists are like the Western saints and social justice warriors in my eyes.

124
0:4:53,2 --> 0:4:54,48
Social justice warriors are quite interesting.

125
0:4:54,48 --> 0:4:55,98
Social justice warriors distribute bread.

126
0:4:55,98 --> 0:4:59,3
They would say to distribute this bread to 100 people.

127
0:4:59,3 --> 0:5:0,56
There are people in need

128
0:5:0,56 --> 0:5:3,61
Because you can produce 100 loaves of bread a day

129
0:5:3,61 --> 0:5:8,74
When you distribute the 100 loaves to these 100 people, it won’t be evenly distributed

130
0:5:8,74 --> 0:5:9,76
And there won’t be any idle hands

131
0:5:9,76 --> 0:5:12,6
Then these 100 people won’t start working

132
0:5:12,6 --> 0:5:14,28
Instead, they will all rely on your welfare to survive

133
0:5:14,28 --> 0:5:16,2
But that’s an ideal scenario

134
0:5:16,2 --> 0:5:18,22
How would it play out in reality?

135
0:5:18,22 --> 0:5:20,2
Because you’ve provided generous welfare

136
0:5:20,2 --> 0:5:21,98
This is particularly beneficial for them.

137
0:5:21,98 --> 0:5:23,98
They can eat their fill without working.

138
0:5:23,98 --> 0:5:27,96
So, in reality, countless people will flood into your country.

139
0:5:27,96 --> 0:5:29,6
Flood into your tribe.

140
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:30,909
Today, it might be 100 people.

141
0:5:30,909 --> 0:5:32,349
Tomorrow, it could be 5,000 people.

142
0:5:32,349 --> 0:5:33,949
The day after, 300,000 people.

143
0:5:33,949 --> 0:5:36,469
And the day after that, 1.5 million people.

144
0:5:36,469 --> 0:5:38,89
How do you deal with such a large influx of immigrants?

145
0:5:38,89 --> 0:5:43,1
You can increase your magic power from making 100 loaves of bread to 150 loaves.

146
0:5:43,1 --> 0:5:44,3
Can you sell ten thousand loaves of bread?

147
0:5:44,3 --> 0:5:45,34
Then what would you become?

148
0:5:45,34 --> 0:5:47,6
Wouldn't you become a feeder then?

149
0:5:47,85 --> 0:5:53,15
Most importantly, you wouldn't be able to motivate people in society to work.

150
0:5:53,15 --> 0:5:55,81
That's the world the Western saints hope for.

151
0:5:55,81 --> 0:5:58,17
You should pay more taxes.

152
0:5:58,17 --> 0:6:0,51
The rich should contribute more money.

153
0:6:0,51 --> 0:6:1,69
But the rich aren't foolish either.

154
0:6:1,69 --> 0:6:3,19
The wealthy will leave.

155
0:6:3,19 --> 0:6:5,64
Large corporations will move to other countries to grow.

156
0:6:5,64 --> 0:6:8,68
So, how do you maintain the art of governance?

157
0:6:8,68 --> 0:6:13,31
How do you ensure the broadest possible benefit for the entire community?

158
0:6:13,31 --> 0:6:14,43
For the whole civilization?

159
0:6:14,43 --> 0:6:17,41
For the entire large nation?

160
0:6:18,97 --> 0:6:20,37
Actually, governing a small country

161
0:6:20,37 --> 0:6:21,45
Like Finland,

162
0:6:21,45 --> 0:6:24,8
Or Liechtenstein, is relatively easier.

163
0:6:24,8 --> 0:6:27,2
But governing a large country can be extremely painful.

164
0:6:27,2 --> 0:6:29,73
Generally speaking, the universe is indifferent.

165
0:6:29,73 --> 0:6:31,77
Look at the dynasties throughout Chinese history.

166
0:6:31,77 --> 0:6:34,41
The most terrifying are all kinds of natural disasters and human misfortunes.

167
0:6:34,41 --> 0:6:35,71
When it comes to these things,

168
0:6:38,79 --> 0:6:39,99
these matters are quite challenging.

169
0:6:39,99 --> 0:6:42,299
But you'll find Marxist theory interesting,

170
0:6:42,299 --> 0:6:44,39
I really like that aspect.

171
0:6:44,39 --> 0:6:46,46
Why I particularly enjoy the Book of Lord Shang and the Discourses on Salt and Iron.

172
0:6:46,46 --> 0:6:47,74
When it comes to Legalism

173
0:6:47,74 --> 0:6:52,76
you might find that on the surface, Legalism seems heartless and cruel

174
0:6:52,76 --> 0:6:56,25
but in reality, this heartlessness towards certain individuals

175
0:6:56,25 --> 0:6:57,39
is limited

176
0:6:57,39 --> 0:6:59,31
and not entirely ruthless

177
0:6:59,31 --> 0:7:3,36
while many people, like Ye Wenjie, who are seen as benevolent

178
0:7:3,36 --> 0:7:4,58
if you truly act that way

179
0:7:4,58 --> 0:7:6,86
it could potentially lead to the end of civilization

180
0:7:6,86 --> 0:7:9,88
so your compassion needs to have a boundary

181
0:7:9,88 --> 0:7:11,18
Your compassion

182
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:13,0
as a Buddha

183
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:14,21
you can

184
0:7:14,21 --> 0:7:15,13
love all and refrain from aggression

185
0:7:15,13 --> 0:7:16,17
love the world without discrimination

186
0:7:18,7 --> 0:7:19,77
as a clan leader

187
0:7:19,77 --> 0:7:23,34
how should you safeguard the rise and fall, the glory and disgrace of the entire group

188
0:7:23,34 --> 0:7:24,26
share life and death

189
0:7:24,26 --> 0:7:25,82
this is a very complex matter

190
0:7:25,82 --> 0:7:29,8
So you must not only have a compassionate heart

191
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:30,74
but you also need to be wise

192
0:7:30,74 --> 0:7:32,25
what we mean by having virtue

193
0:7:32,25 --> 0:7:33,53
is to have moral integrity

194
0:7:33,53 --> 0:7:35,34
to influence others with your virtue

195
0:7:35,34 --> 0:7:36,5
when it comes to virtue

196
0:7:36,5 --> 0:7:37,4
in the Warring States period

197
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:39,66
or in a complex and chaotic environment

198
0:7:39,66 --> 0:7:41,26
it's impossible to survive in such a world

199
0:7:41,26 --> 0:7:44,6
So, generally speaking, it's about paying lip service while acting contrary.

200
0:7:44,6 --> 0:7:47,42
On the surface, we uphold the highest moral standards.

201
0:7:47,42 --> 0:7:49,2
We still need to promote this image publicly.

202
0:7:49,2 --> 0:7:50,38
We are people of high moral principles.

203
0:7:50,38 --> 0:7:51,74
We are not Machiavellian.

204
0:7:51,74 --> 0:7:52,96
But in reality,

205
0:7:52,96 --> 0:7:57,18
it's always about the Legalist tactics under the Confucian facade.

206
0:7:57,18 --> 0:7:59,33
The power must be wielded with precision.

207
0:7:59,33 --> 0:8:1,29
When immigrants flood in, there’s no solution.

208
0:8:1,29 --> 0:8:2,63
Of course, some people might say

209
0:8:2,63 --> 0:8:6,98
if you set the price of bread so low

210
0:8:6,98 --> 0:8:9,46
look at how high the prices of agricultural products are in Japan

211
0:8:9,46 --> 0:8:11,6
is it because Japan has agricultural cooperatives

212
0:8:11,6 --> 0:8:13,2
ensuring farmers have enough to eat and wear

213
0:8:13,2 --> 0:8:15,54
and that farmers are doing really well

214
0:8:15,54 --> 0:8:17,7
but compared to many other countries

215
0:8:17,7 --> 0:8:19,61
the attitude of Japanese agricultural cooperatives towards farmers is different

216
0:8:19,61 --> 0:8:21,97
when Japanese agricultural cooperatives ensure farmers have enough to eat and wear

217
0:8:21,97 --> 0:8:26,13
He raised the price of the most basic necessities to an extremely high level

218
0:8:26,13 --> 0:8:28,31
which would lead to an intense competition across society

219
0:8:28,31 --> 0:8:32,68
everyone would go to great lengths to secure these 2,200 calories

220
0:8:32,68 --> 0:8:34,84
the economy would certainly grow

221
0:8:34,84 --> 0:8:35,24
right?

222
0:8:35,24 --> 0:8:36,76
the happiness index of the people would also rise

223
0:8:36,76 --> 0:8:38,809
but no one could afford to stop working

224
0:8:38,809 --> 0:8:40,809
so how exactly does this play out

225
0:8:40,809 --> 0:8:44,3
you'd find that 100 loaves of bread are given to these ten people

226
0:8:44,3 --> 0:8:47,34
Whether it's the scholar-official groups or the Brahmans and Kshatriyas

227
0:8:47,34 --> 0:8:49,14
or the samurai of Japan

228
0:8:49,14 --> 0:8:49,82
regardless

229
0:8:49,82 --> 0:8:52,12
it's all about the art of proxy rule

230
0:8:52,12 --> 0:8:55,48
when you play Mount & Blade without mods

231
0:8:55,48 --> 0:8:58,58
you'll find that there are far too many kings in Calradia

232
0:8:58,58 --> 0:9:3,379
but think about it, to rule the Calradia continent perfectly

233
0:9:3,379 --> 0:9:4,779
as long as you don't use cheats

234
0:9:4,779 --> 0:9:6,399
you have to rely on the nobility

235
0:9:6,399 --> 0:9:7,759
Because in feudal times

236
0:9:7,759 --> 0:9:9,599
orders couldn't be transmitted instantly

237
0:9:9,599 --> 0:9:11,24
there was a time lag

238
0:9:11,24 --> 0:9:13,28
so you had to use a proxy rule method

239
0:9:13,28 --> 0:9:14,52
that's how it was

240
0:9:14,52 --> 0:9:16,56
just like Heshen's way of governance

241
0:9:16,56 --> 0:9:17,4
with two mouths above and below

242
0:9:17,4 --> 0:9:18,94
if you don't serve the mouth above

243
0:9:18,94 --> 0:9:20,52
the mouth below can never be satisfied

244
0:9:20,52 --> 0:9:22,64
So this is what caused the redundancy in governance.

245
0:9:22,64 --> 0:9:24,46
There were many redundancies in the distribution system.

246
0:9:24,46 --> 0:9:25,34
This is the issue we're discussing.

247
0:9:25,34 --> 0:9:26,16
To put it another way,

248
0:9:26,16 --> 0:9:30,35
We say that the imperial system and the feudal system are two completely different systems.

249
0:9:30,35 --> 0:9:31,26
Feudalism,

250
0:9:31,26 --> 0:9:33,6
the establishment of vassal states, is a feudal system.

251
0:9:33,6 --> 0:9:33,82
The imperial system,

252
0:9:33,82 --> 0:9:34,58
provincial administration,

253
0:9:34,58 --> 0:9:35,3
These items

254
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:36,42
bureaucratic counties

255
0:9:36,42 --> 0:9:37,86
This is another system

256
0:9:37,86 --> 0:9:40,18
So we talk about Machiavellianism emerging

257
0:9:40,18 --> 0:9:41,34
When discussing this book

258
0:9:43,849 --> 0:9:47,829
Machiavellianism isn't meant for the common people

259
0:9:47,829 --> 0:9:51,34
In fact, Machiavellianism is intended for the wise

260
0:9:51,34 --> 0:9:52,38
to help you understand

261
0:9:52,38 --> 0:9:53,98
when you are a common person

262
0:9:56,14 --> 0:9:57,78
When you are a ruler,

263
0:9:57,78 --> 0:9:59,18
you also need to be aware,

264
0:9:59,18 --> 0:10:0,38
you can't be too naive,

265
0:10:0,38 --> 0:10:2,41
you can't be overly merciful,

266
0:10:2,41 --> 0:10:3,73
being overly merciful is not an option,

267
0:10:3,73 --> 0:10:5,45
it might end up harming the other party,

268
0:10:5,45 --> 0:10:6,41
so in many people's opinion,

269
0:10:6,41 --> 0:10:10,86
we say that the messenger of light standing in the darkness is truly remarkable,

270
0:10:10,86 --> 0:10:12,22
the so-called morning star

271
0:10:12,22 --> 0:10:13,32
Morning Star

272
0:10:13,32 --> 0:10:15,0
the so-called Venus

273
0:10:15,0 --> 0:10:17,8
it's actually the same thing

274
0:10:17,8 --> 0:10:18,8
we often talk about a movie

275
0:10:18,8 --> 0:10:20,64
there's a TV show called Lucifer

276
0:10:20,64 --> 0:10:23,24
talking about Lucifer, the devil himself

277
0:10:23,24 --> 0:10:24,6
I'm not promoting devil worship

278
0:10:24,6 --> 0:10:26,4
I'm talking about the metaphor behind it

279
0:10:26,4 --> 0:10:28,32
Lucifer is the fallen angel

280
0:10:28,32 --> 0:10:30,0
He messed up this angel

281
0:10:30,0 --> 0:10:31,92
And then went against God

282
0:10:31,92 --> 0:10:35,44
You'll find out what these things are really about

283
0:10:35,44 --> 0:10:37,94
They're talking about evil

284
0:10:37,94 --> 0:10:41,8
The role it plays in goodness

285
0:10:41,8 --> 0:10:42,93
Taiji is not purely white

286
0:10:42,93 --> 0:10:44,51
Taiji has yang within yin

287
0:10:44,51 --> 0:10:45,29
And yin within yang

288
0:10:45,29 --> 0:10:47,5
It's a blend of black and white

289
0:10:47,5 --> 0:10:49,3
It embodies the principle of Yin and Yang, opposing forces that are interdependent.

290
0:10:49,3 --> 0:10:51,5
It represents the coexistence of good and evil.

291
0:10:54,35 --> 0:10:57,319
This is the concept of opposing elements existing simultaneously.

292
0:10:57,319 --> 0:11:1,919
Therefore, good and evil are intertwined, each defining the other.

293
0:11:1,919 --> 0:11:4,88
So, among all the angels, we say that

294
0:11:4,88 --> 0:11:7,12
Lucifer is the best and most benevolent,

295
0:11:7,12 --> 0:11:8,24
the healthiest one,

296
0:11:8,24 --> 0:11:10,41
because he plays the role of the antagonist.

297
0:11:10,41 --> 0:11:12,77
Perhaps this idea might be hard for you to grasp.

298
0:11:12,77 --> 0:11:14,77
But in Western mythology,

299
0:11:14,77 --> 0:11:17,13
Lucifer is often portrayed as a villain.

300
0:11:17,13 --> 0:11:19,53
However, in Eastern mythology,

301
0:11:19,53 --> 0:11:20,87
Lucifer, the Morning Star,

302
0:11:20,87 --> 0:11:22,73
is seen as a good character, the planet Venus.

303
0:11:22,73 --> 0:11:25,23
In fact, Venus truly helped Sun Wukong.

304
0:11:25,23 --> 0:11:26,91
Many people don't understand this point.

305
0:11:26,91 --> 0:11:29,67
But why did you suddenly start talking about this Venus, Brother Rong?

306
0:11:29,67 --> 0:11:31,25
Why start mentioning this Morning Star?

307
0:11:31,25 --> 0:11:34,89
This is actually a superficial metaphor for a statesman.

308
0:11:34,89 --> 0:11:37,51
It refers to people who cause chaos in the world.

309
0:11:37,51 --> 0:11:40,569
Yet, they are the ones who uphold peace in the world.

310
0:11:40,569 --> 0:11:43,909
For example, conflicts and wars in various parts of the world today.

311
0:11:43,909 --> 0:11:48,25
These conflicts and wars create immense chaos.

312
0:11:48,25 --> 0:11:51,79
But they also contribute to a trend that maintains overall peace in the world.

313
0:11:51,79 --> 0:11:54,3
Because people come to understand the true horrors of war and famine.

314
0:11:54,3 --> 0:11:58,31
The devastation and massacres that these bring.

315
0:11:58,31 --> 0:12:1,83
Thus, extreme good and extreme evil can sometimes be a matter of a moment.

316
0:12:1,83 --> 0:12:3,3
In a split second

317
0:12:3,3 --> 0:12:5,14
people's polarity can easily shift

318
0:12:5,14 --> 0:12:6,62
but often

319
0:12:7,84 --> 0:12:8,7
great deceit appears as truth

320
0:12:8,7 --> 0:12:10,82
sometimes you don't understand this concept

321
0:12:10,82 --> 0:12:12,36
but we talk about knowledge

322
0:12:12,36 --> 0:12:14,86
the accumulation of knowledge is boundless

323
0:12:14,86 --> 0:12:16,92
in our land

324
0:12:16,92 --> 0:12:19,4
knowledge is unrestricted

325
0:12:19,4 --> 0:12:22,96
You can buy Hayek's books in all the stores today.

326
0:12:22,96 --> 0:12:24,56
Even the unedited versions.

327
0:12:24,56 --> 0:12:25,48
That's why

328
0:12:25,48 --> 0:12:26,68
our knowledge

329
0:12:26,68 --> 0:12:27,839
including political science

330
0:12:27,839 --> 0:12:28,639
sociology

331
0:12:28,639 --> 0:12:29,679
and humanities

332
0:12:29,679 --> 0:12:31,639
is actually open to all citizens.

333
0:12:31,639 --> 0:12:33,31
This is one of the greatest aspects of it.

334
0:12:33,31 --> 0:12:35,35
In our time, speaking of it

335
0:12:35,35 --> 0:12:36,15
as an intellectual

336
0:12:36,15 --> 0:12:37,67
it is a joyful thing

337
0:12:37,67 --> 0:12:40,79
so we have to talk about the issue of bread distribution again

338
0:12:40,79 --> 0:12:44,33
what is the main goal of bread distribution?

339
0:12:44,33 --> 0:12:48,839
The main goal is to harness the maximum labor power of these 100 people

340
0:12:48,839 --> 0:12:52,299
because when you achieve the maximum labor output

341
0:12:52,299 --> 0:12:54,839
when you have the maximum labor productivity

342
0:12:54,839 --> 0:12:57,6
the resources you acquire are the greatest

343
0:12:57,6 --> 0:12:58,82
It's the most abundant

344
0:12:58,82 --> 0:13:1,83
You can use the remaining 90 dollars to buy bread

345
0:13:1,83 --> 0:13:3,89
Or you can leverage the output of these 100 people

346
0:13:3,89 --> 0:13:5,91
You expand his house

347
0:13:5,91 --> 0:13:8,49
Water management, healthcare, and education

348
0:13:8,49 --> 0:13:10,83
Then you build tall barriers

349
0:13:10,83 --> 0:13:13,9
You can't let just anyone join your country

350
0:13:13,9 --> 0:13:13,79
That's how it is

351
0:13:13,79 --> 0:13:15,79
And then we boost our economy

352
0:13:15,79 --> 0:13:18,44
To make our tribe thrive and flourish

353
0:13:18,44 --> 0:13:19,52
And gradually grow

354
0:13:19,52 --> 0:13:20,76
The population will gradually increase

355
0:13:20,76 --> 0:13:24,58
Only then can everyone finally put down their hoes

356
0:13:24,58 --> 0:13:25,98
And eventually step into the classroom

357
0:13:25,98 --> 0:13:28,12
And ultimately go home to play games

358
0:13:28,12 --> 0:13:30,54
So, regarding my view of the future

359
0:13:30,54 --> 0:13:32,98
I’ve never really been an optimist

360
0:13:32,98 --> 0:13:35,35
But I’m optimistic about the future

361
0:13:35,35 --> 0:13:37,53
I believe that human technology

362
0:13:37,53 --> 0:13:38,43
robotics

363
0:13:38,43 --> 0:13:39,15
brain-computer interfaces

364
0:13:39,15 --> 0:13:43,79
and all these things are well-aligned with the priorities of some countries

365
0:13:43,79 --> 0:13:45,559
I would say there are only two great nations in the world

366
0:13:45,559 --> 0:13:46,759
one is the People's Republic of China

367
0:13:46,759 --> 0:13:48,79
and the other is the United States of America

368
0:13:48,79 --> 0:13:50,42
I have always praised both China and the U.S.

369
0:13:50,42 --> 0:13:53,1
because many people compare various aspects of China and the U.S.

370
0:13:53,1 --> 0:13:55,86
He doesn't understand the art of politics.

371
0:13:55,86 --> 0:13:58,4
So he sees some surface phenomena.

372
0:13:58,4 --> 0:13:59,16
He will criticize them.

373
0:13:59,16 --> 0:14:0,4
He will add something to it.

374
0:14:0,4 --> 0:14:2,26
But a lot of these issues are growing pains.

375
0:14:2,26 --> 0:14:5,79
Of course, one day when we truly achieve an abundance of material wealth,

376
0:14:5,79 --> 0:14:6,83
everywhere will be balanced,

377
0:14:6,83 --> 0:14:7,63
everywhere will be warm.

378
0:14:7,63 --> 0:14:9,75
I believe this is due to AI technology.

379
0:14:9,75 --> 0:14:12,61
This was achieved due to the manufacturing of robotics.

380
0:14:12,61 --> 0:14:15,63
What new formations of society emerged at that time?

381
0:14:15,63 --> 0:14:17,87
Or what new distribution structures appeared?

382
0:14:17,87 --> 0:14:19,83
That's what we're talking about for that period.

383
0:14:19,83 --> 0:14:21,3
But we believe one thing:

384
0:14:21,3 --> 0:14:22,47
Because the productive force has advanced.

385
0:14:22,47 --> 0:14:24,38
Because the total production of materials has increased.

386
0:14:24,38 --> 0:14:26,9
Because today we're not just producing 100 loaves of bread anymore.

387
0:14:26,9 --> 0:14:28,14
We might have 10,000 loaves of bread.

388
0:14:28,14 --> 0:14:28,98
A million loaves of bread

389
0:14:28,98 --> 0:14:30,67
and they are produced automatically

390
0:14:30,67 --> 0:14:32,59
So, for humans

391
0:14:32,59 --> 0:14:36,55
we can say that compared to the primitive people, the people from the Stone Age

392
0:14:36,55 --> 0:14:38,7
and the people from the feudal era

393
0:14:38,7 --> 0:14:40,109
our labor is much easier

394
0:14:40,109 --> 0:14:44,469
So, once you understand the Bronze Age

395
0:14:44,469 --> 0:14:47,48
this is an incredibly good game

396
0:14:47,48 --> 0:14:49,24
it can help you understand economic development

397
0:14:49,24 --> 0:14:50,24
The distribution in society

398
0:14:50,24 --> 0:14:53,4
the art of political governance, how should it be approached?

399
0:14:53,4 --> 0:14:56,0
What strategies should be adopted in the early stages?

400
0:14:56,0 --> 0:14:57,92
What strategies should be taken in the middle stages?

401
0:14:57,92 --> 0:15:2,65
I believe the creator of this game is also a staunch

402
0:15:2,65 --> 0:15:3,97
Machiavellian

403
0:15:3,97 --> 0:15:5,33
a firm Machiavellian

404
0:15:5,33 --> 0:15:8,62
who speaks very frankly about the essence of politics

405
0:15:8,62 --> 0:15:12,56
which involves some level of deceit and cruelty

406
0:15:12,56 --> 0:15:14,2
and some level of manipulation

407
0:15:14,2 --> 0:15:15,66
not overly concerned with

408
0:15:15,66 --> 0:15:16,94
initial fairness

409
0:15:16,94 --> 0:15:19,28
if the initial stage is too fair

410
0:15:19,28 --> 0:15:21,48
you might forget that society needs competition

411
0:15:21,48 --> 0:15:23,5
because there's not just one nation in this world

412
0:15:23,5 --> 0:15:24,6
not just one tribe

413
0:15:24,6 --> 0:15:26,1
not just one race

414
0:15:26,1 --> 0:15:28,57
all these things need to contend with natural disasters and human calamities

415
0:15:28,57 --> 0:15:29,63
and immigration

416
0:15:29,63 --> 0:15:31,43
and emigration

417
0:15:31,43 --> 0:15:32,95
and the cycle of life and death

418
0:15:32,95 --> 0:15:34,83
and all sorts of challenges

419
0:15:34,83 --> 0:15:36,3
while maintaining stability

420
0:15:36,3 --> 0:15:37,79
and expanding outward

421
0:15:37,79 --> 0:15:39,17
so in many cases

422
0:15:39,17 --> 0:15:40,41
maintaining a large country

423
0:15:40,41 --> 0:15:41,84
maintaining a peaceful state

424
0:15:41,84 --> 0:15:45,32
maintaining a state of abundant resources is extremely difficult

425
0:15:45,32 --> 0:15:47,6
you can't judge the whole by a part

426
0:15:47,6 --> 0:15:49,32
seeing a little bit and drawing a hasty conclusion

427
0:15:49,32 --> 0:15:50,72
that would be entirely wrong

428
0:15:50,72 --> 0:15:51,76
for me

429
0:15:51,76 --> 0:15:55,39
a Machiavellian sees everything as normal

430
0:15:55,39 --> 0:15:57,16
sees everything as normal

431
0:15:57,16 --> 0:15:58,6
so in many ways

432
0:15:58,6 --> 0:16:0,0
today, you must possess a very high level of wisdom

433
0:16:0,0 --> 0:16:2,84
to understand some of the events that happen in society

434
0:16:2,84 --> 0:16:5,36
not just from the perspective of the parties involved

435
0:16:5,36 --> 0:16:10,66
how to achieve the greatest common good

436
0:16:10,66 --> 0:16:13,78
from the perspective of the broader racial interests

437
0:16:13,78 --> 0:16:16,36
from the perspective of the development of civilization

438
0:16:16,36 --> 0:16:18,1
what is most important

439
0:16:18,1 --> 0:16:19,62
certainly, sacrifices must be made for the few

440
0:16:19,62 --> 0:16:21,6
the few

441
0:16:21,6 --> 0:16:22,28
or even many people over a long period

442
0:16:22,28 --> 0:16:25,81
that's how the world works

443
0:16:25,81 --> 0:16:27,29
there is no absolute fairness

444
0:16:27,29 --> 0:16:28,53
you can't be like Ye Wenjie

445
0:16:28,53 --> 0:16:29,81
can't be too idealistic

446
0:16:29,81 --> 0:16:30,89
only by not being too idealistic

447
0:16:30,89 --> 0:16:31,97
can we survive in the future

448
0:16:31,97 --> 0:16:33,21
and thrive in this era

449
0:16:33,21 --> 0:16:34,84
Living in the present era
