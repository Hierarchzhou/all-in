1
0:0:0,62 --> 0:0:2,16
Hi, kids, everyone!

2
0:0:2,16 --> 0:0:4,86
This is my last episode in Hangzhou.

3
0:0:4,86 --> 0:0:9,36
Because I've finished moving today, yes, all done.

4
0:0:9,36 --> 0:0:11,42
Pretty much everything is thoroughly moved out.

5
0:0:11,42 --> 0:0:17,69
And this should be episode number 509, I think.

6
0:0:17,69 --> 0:0:18,33
I'm not sure though.

7
0:0:18,33 --> 0:0:19,81
This episode might be a bit disjointed.

8
0:0:19,81 --> 0:0:22,35
Because SF Express will be coming by again soon.

9
0:0:22,35 --> 0:0:24,39
To pick up the Wuchang rice from my place.

10
0:0:24,39 --> 0:0:26,439
Because the delivery person forgot to drop it off just now.

11
0:0:26,439 --> 0:0:29,59
My landlord is pretty nice.

12
0:0:29,59 --> 0:0:32,239
And I've added a lot of new furniture to the house.

13
0:0:32,239 --> 0:0:38,45
I probably won't come back easily this time.

14
0:0:38,98 --> 0:0:40,74
Well, not too easily, I guess.

15
0:0:40,74 --> 0:0:43,1
But if I do come back, there will be a reason to.

16
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:45,65
Because I still have many friends here.

17
0:0:45,65 --> 0:0:48,21
And this time, a lot of people want to treat me to dinner.

18
0:0:48,21 --> 0:0:49,85
I just won't have the time.

19
0:0:49,85 --> 0:0:53,239
I'm going to visit a comic convention in Shanghai on the 4th and 5th of next month.

20
0:0:53,239 --> 0:0:55,719
I might arrive a week earlier.

21
0:0:55,719 --> 0:0:57,659
Or I might leave a week later.

22
0:0:57,659 --> 0:1:0,45
Actually, I won’t be bringing my kids that week.

23
0:1:0,45 --> 0:1:3,81
That’s because I usually take care of them every week.

24
0:1:3,81 --> 0:1:4,949
It’s quite a hassle.

25
0:1:4,949 --> 0:1:7,429
Speaking of why I came to Hangzhou in the first place,

26
0:1:7,429 --> 0:1:8,429
as you all know,

27
0:1:8,429 --> 0:1:9,78
it was for shooting videos.

28
0:1:9,78 --> 0:1:11,74
But why leave Hangzhou now?

29
0:1:11,74 --> 0:1:13,86
Actually, there are many reasons.

30
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:17,449
Mainly because the child is back.

31
0:1:17,449 --> 0:1:19,269
In the past, it was because of the child.

32
0:1:19,269 --> 0:1:23,509
Didn't they go abroad directly?

33
0:1:23,509 --> 0:1:26,789
But now the child is back in Beijing.

34
0:1:26,789 --> 0:1:27,889
And is preparing to go to school.

35
0:1:27,889 --> 0:1:30,549
So we plan to make the most of it.

36
0:1:30,549 --> 0:1:32,8
How should I put it?

37
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:33,48
I'll stick to living in Beijing.

38
0:1:33,48 --> 0:1:36,8
In any case, if I were to live as a bachelor,

39
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:39,419
I would definitely choose Hangzhou.

40
0:1:39,419 --> 0:1:42,859
Because living in Hangzhou is indeed more convenient,

41
0:1:42,859 --> 0:1:44,13
it's really quite,

42
0:1:44,13 --> 0:1:45,77
very convenient.

43
0:1:45,77 --> 0:1:48,29
Many internet companies have chosen Hangzhou as their base,

44
0:1:48,29 --> 0:1:49,55
and handling affairs in Hangzhou,

45
0:1:49,55 --> 0:1:50,52
well, it's just easier.

46
0:1:50,52 --> 0:1:52,24
It's kind of hard to say

47
0:1:52,24 --> 0:1:53,4
it's more convenient

48
0:1:53,4 --> 0:1:53,76
let me tell you

49
0:1:53,76 --> 0:1:54,44
I'm in Beijing

50
0:1:54,44 --> 0:1:56,56
I feel like there are a lot of things

51
0:1:56,56 --> 0:1:59,36
things that are established by usage

52
0:1:59,36 --> 0:2:2,4
that can really get on your nerves

53
0:2:2,4 --> 0:2:3,2
quite troublesome

54
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:4,6
sometimes I am a Beijinger

55
0:2:4,6 --> 0:2:7,49
But I also feel that this Beijing culture is particularly something special

56
0:2:7,49 --> 0:2:10,3
People have their own matters

57
0:2:10,3 --> 0:2:11,43
If they can avoid helping you

58
0:2:11,43 --> 0:2:12,25
They won't help you

59
0:2:12,25 --> 0:2:16,17
And everyone is always hoping others will beg them for favors

60
0:2:16,17 --> 0:2:17,83
But in Hangzhou, that's not the case

61
0:2:17,83 --> 0:2:19,15
It's all about business

62
0:2:19,15 --> 0:2:22,25
Business is conducted as it should be

63
0:2:22,25 --> 0:2:23,97
When it comes to business, we talk business, nothing else

64
0:2:23,97 --> 0:2:25,73
This culture is different

65
0:2:25,73 --> 0:2:26,49
which leads to

66
0:2:26,49 --> 0:2:29,25
the city's development over thousands of years being distinct

67
0:2:29,25 --> 0:2:30,56
not quite a few thousand years

68
0:2:30,56 --> 0:2:32,16
but if we start counting from the Song Dynasty

69
0:2:32,16 --> 0:2:33,84
from the Lin'an Prefecture of the Song Dynasty

70
0:2:33,84 --> 0:2:34,88
that would be a thousand years

71
0:2:34,88 --> 0:2:36,45
so how do we put it

72
0:2:36,45 --> 0:2:38,37
many things are established by usage

73
0:2:38,37 --> 0:2:39,1
That's it.

74
0:2:39,1 --> 0:2:41,55
Then I feel that if you're a bachelor,

75
0:2:41,55 --> 0:2:42,81
coming to Hangzhou,

76
0:2:42,81 --> 0:2:46,13
at least the housing prices aren't as high as in Beijing,

77
0:2:46,13 --> 0:2:48,9
but many people say it's a food desert.

78
0:2:48,9 --> 0:2:48,99
But for me,

79
0:2:48,99 --> 0:2:50,44
a Beijinger who eats McDonald's every day,

80
0:2:50,44 --> 0:2:51,4
a KFC regular,

81
0:2:51,4 --> 0:2:53,8
I don't really care about whether it's a food desert or not.

82
0:2:53,8 --> 0:2:54,4
It’s nothing much to me.

83
0:2:54,4 --> 0:2:56,74
It’s just a bit hotter in the summer.

84
0:2:56,74 --> 0:2:58,54
And in the winter, without heating,

85
0:2:58,54 --> 0:2:59,5
it can get quite cold.

86
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:2,62
But the place is blessed with talented people who are generally quite good-looking.

87
0:3:2,62 --> 0:3:4,66
There’s not much else to it.

88
0:3:4,66 --> 0:3:6,84
Unlike the harsh northern regions.

89
0:3:6,84 --> 0:3:7,96
But let me tell you,

90
0:3:7,96 --> 0:3:10,36
it all depends on whether you can adapt to it.

91
0:3:10,36 --> 0:3:12,24
If I were to speak from my perspective

92
0:3:12,24 --> 0:3:13,64
Shenyang would be a pretty good choice

93
0:3:13,64 --> 0:3:14,92
But in many people's eyes

94
0:3:14,92 --> 0:3:17,88
Shenyang might not be as fancy as your hometown

95
0:3:17,88 --> 0:3:19,1
But for me

96
0:3:19,1 --> 0:3:22,52
whether it's the cost of living or the cultural environment

97
0:3:22,52 --> 0:3:24,649
or the lifestyle of the people

98
0:3:24,649 --> 0:3:26,6
or the way people interact

99
0:3:26,6 --> 0:3:27,88
I also have a lot of friends in Shenyang

100
0:3:27,88 --> 0:3:29,54
But if I had to choose myself

101
0:3:29,54 --> 0:3:32,2
I would definitely travel all over the country

102
0:3:32,2 --> 0:3:33,8
spend a year in each place

103
0:3:33,8 --> 0:3:35,15
But speaking of this place

104
0:3:35,15 --> 0:3:36,23
I’ve been here for three months

105
0:3:36,23 --> 0:3:38,76
but I’ve actually stayed here for less than a month

106
0:3:38,76 --> 0:3:40,62
mostly going back home to take care of my dad

107
0:3:40,62 --> 0:3:41,76
and then my son came back

108
0:3:41,76 --> 0:3:42,64
he returned in early March

109
0:3:42,64 --> 0:3:44,62
So I'm here to move out for good

110
0:3:44,62 --> 0:3:47,14
I really do find it quite uncomfortable

111
0:3:47,14 --> 0:3:48,64
Because the internet here

112
0:3:48,64 --> 0:3:49,62
China Telecom's network

113
0:3:49,62 --> 0:3:51,98
you basically don't need a booster to run Steam

114
0:3:51,98 --> 0:3:54,579
which is a huge advantage

115
0:3:54,579 --> 0:3:56,179
I want to chat with you all about

116
0:3:56,179 --> 0:3:57,339
I just want to say to everyone

117
0:3:57,339 --> 0:3:58,739
as you grow older

118
0:3:58,739 --> 0:4:0,619
A lot of things are constantly changing.

119
0:4:0,619 --> 0:4:2,81
What you used to imagine, you know,

120
0:4:2,81 --> 0:4:4,69
the life where you can feed yourself and not worry about others,

121
0:4:4,69 --> 0:4:6,21
as you get older,

122
0:4:6,21 --> 0:4:7,81
you might not be able to do that anymore.

123
0:4:7,81 --> 0:4:10,37
When you were young, you often didn't have money,

124
0:4:10,37 --> 0:4:11,11
no money,

125
0:4:11,11 --> 0:4:13,12
but you had plenty of time,

126
0:4:13,12 --> 0:4:14,34
and you were in good shape.

127
0:4:14,34 --> 0:4:16,16
When you get to my age,

128
0:4:16,16 --> 0:4:18,36
your body starts to decline gradually.

129
0:4:18,36 --> 0:4:18,84
You know,

130
0:4:18,84 --> 0:4:20,96
you'll start noticing the decline.

131
0:4:20,96 --> 0:4:23,589
I’m not kidding about this stuff.

132
0:4:23,589 --> 0:4:25,96
I’ve found myself gradually losing stamina.

133
0:4:25,96 --> 0:4:29,16
Maybe it’s from playing too many games on Steam.

134
0:4:29,16 --> 0:4:31,4
The threshold keeps going up.

135
0:4:31,4 --> 0:4:33,63
And now, even watching movies is tough.

136
0:4:33,63 --> 0:4:36,99
We mostly watch TS-themed movies.

137
0:4:36,99 --> 0:4:39,25
You see, many of my friends are TS.

138
0:4:39,25 --> 0:4:43,11
I feel like my threshold has risen too quickly lately.

139
0:4:43,11 --> 0:4:46,99
So sometimes when I encounter a regular scene,

140
0:4:46,99 --> 0:4:49,73
It doesn’t feel as arousing anymore.

141
0:4:49,73 --> 0:4:50,17
You know what I mean?

142
0:4:50,17 --> 0:4:51,29
To put it bluntly, it just doesn’t cut it anymore.

143
0:4:51,29 --> 0:4:54,18
From now on, you’ll be in the category of someone who goes fishing.

144
0:4:54,18 --> 0:4:57,58
But I don’t feel as young and enthusiastic as I used to.

145
0:4:57,58 --> 0:4:59,18
It's getting better and better.

146
0:4:59,18 --> 0:5:1,26
I think this is a natural process of human evolution.

147
0:5:1,26 --> 0:5:2,28
You reach a certain age,

148
0:5:2,28 --> 0:5:5,489
and these defective parts gradually start to wear out.

149
0:5:5,489 --> 0:5:6,989
It’s a very normal process.

150
0:5:6,989 --> 0:5:8,83
But after they wear out,

151
0:5:8,83 --> 0:5:10,69
you still have several decades left to live.

152
0:5:10,69 --> 0:5:12,9
So I think it’s okay.

153
0:5:12,9 --> 0:5:12,89
I think it’s fine.

154
0:5:12,89 --> 0:5:14,909
Actually, it's just that people's life goals have changed.

155
0:5:14,909 --> 0:5:17,929
Think about it, this life is actually for such things.

156
0:5:17,929 --> 0:5:19,49
For women.

157
0:5:19,49 --> 0:5:22,9
In fact, most of the money spent in this life is for women.

158
0:5:22,9 --> 0:5:24,79
Whether it's for marriage or studying abroad.

159
0:5:24,79 --> 0:5:28,67
At the beginning, there was always a reason behind it.

160
0:5:28,67 --> 0:5:30,61
It's not like I initially wanted to study abroad.

161
0:5:30,61 --> 0:5:33,49
Actually, there was a girlfriend who went to France.

162
0:5:33,49 --> 0:5:34,53
Not when she went to France.

163
0:5:34,53 --> 0:5:36,61
It was purely to learn before going to Canada

164
0:5:36,61 --> 0:5:39,58
Back then, it was indeed to be with my girlfriend

165
0:5:39,58 --> 0:5:42,3
When you're in your twenties, you really do act strangely

166
0:5:42,3 --> 0:5:45,54
But I always thought I wouldn't repeat the same mistake

167
0:5:45,54 --> 0:5:47,7
Turns out I made the same mistake again in marriage

168
0:5:47,7 --> 0:5:50,18
Well, in the end, life is like that

169
0:5:50,18 --> 0:5:52,5
You keep making the same mistakes

170
0:5:52,5 --> 0:5:54,31
And you don't learn from them

171
0:5:54,31 --> 0:5:55,3
And you don't move forward

172
0:5:55,3 --> 0:5:57,96
And it keeps repeating this process.

173
0:5:57,96 --> 0:5:59,12
Frankly speaking,

174
0:5:59,12 --> 0:6:1,88
Throughout my life, regarding this issue of temptation being a double-edged sword,

175
0:6:1,88 --> 0:6:4,24
I've actually experienced it quite a few times.

176
0:6:4,24 --> 0:6:7,25
But how can I put it,

177
0:6:7,25 --> 0:6:8,73
I'm not too bad myself,

178
0:6:8,73 --> 0:6:10,5
So when I'm doing well,

179
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:11,93
I always think I can handle it,

180
0:6:11,93 --> 0:6:14,39
But wait until I really can't manage it.

181
0:6:14,39 --> 0:6:15,759
There might be fewer distractions.

182
0:6:15,759 --> 0:6:19,5
So I think every period of time is a blessing.

183
0:6:19,5 --> 0:6:20,32
Each period is a blessing.

184
0:6:20,32 --> 0:6:22,2
Look at everything with a broader perspective.

185
0:6:22,2 --> 0:6:24,16
Thinking positively about everything is a good thing.

186
0:6:24,16 --> 0:6:26,35
Don't always be gloomy.

187
0:6:26,35 --> 0:6:27,63
Because every period has its moments.

188
0:6:27,63 --> 0:6:29,97
Every period has its unhappy moments.

189
0:6:29,97 --> 0:6:31,59
If you keep dwelling on unhappy things

190
0:6:31,59 --> 0:6:33,11
You won't truly be happy

191
0:6:33,11 --> 0:6:36,17
if you focus on happy things every day

192
0:6:36,17 --> 0:6:38,96
you might not feel so down

193
0:6:39,72 --> 0:6:44,1
After all, life is full of the ordinary

194
0:6:44,1 --> 0:6:49,5
don't let the fear of making mistakes tie you up in knots

195
0:6:49,5 --> 0:6:50,98
because you will make mistakes

196
0:6:50,98 --> 0:6:53,86
and think your life is over

197
0:6:53,86 --> 0:6:56,58
making mistakes and correcting them is a normal part of learning

198
0:6:56,58 --> 0:6:57,22
you won't learn without making mistakes

199
0:6:57,22 --> 0:6:58,14
How can you change that?

200
0:6:58,14 --> 0:6:58,71
Right?

201
0:6:58,71 --> 0:7:0,47
Let's talk about mending the fold after the sheep are lost.

202
0:7:0,47 --> 0:7:1,83
Isn't it true that we learn from our mistakes?

203
0:7:1,83 --> 0:7:2,91
That's how we get through it.

204
0:7:2,91 --> 0:7:4,43
Of course, there are certain challenges in life

205
0:7:4,43 --> 0:7:6,44
You might make the same mistake a few times

206
0:7:6,44 --> 0:7:7,84
But when you make a mistake for the first time

207
0:7:7,84 --> 0:7:8,84
You might not learn the lesson

208
0:7:8,84 --> 0:7:10,36
The second time, you learn a part of the lesson.

209
0:7:10,36 --> 0:7:13,24
The third time, you might learn the lesson very deeply.

210
0:7:13,24 --> 0:7:13,8
It can be really painful.

211
0:7:13,8 --> 0:7:14,72
And that’s when the lesson truly sinks in.

212
0:7:14,72 --> 0:7:17,0
Then your mission in this life is accomplished.

213
0:7:17,0 --> 0:7:17,36
Isn’t that right?

214
0:7:17,36 --> 0:7:17,88
They say

215
0:7:17,88 --> 0:7:21,65
that life is actually about learning these lessons.

216
0:7:21,65 --> 0:7:23,65
Some things just don’t make sense out of context.

217
0:7:23,65 --> 0:7:24,73
There's no way to learn.

218
0:7:24,73 --> 0:7:27,21
So I recommend everyone to learn English.

219
0:7:27,21 --> 0:7:28,67
When learning any language,

220
0:7:28,67 --> 0:7:30,97
it's crucial to place it in context.

221
0:7:30,97 --> 0:7:32,97
It makes sense when you put it in context.

222
0:7:32,97 --> 0:7:34,77
It becomes easier to learn when you place it in context.

223
0:7:34,77 --> 0:7:36,61
Always put yourself in the context.

224
0:7:36,61 --> 0:7:40,909
So the most convenient way is to play games.

225
0:7:40,909 --> 0:7:42,709
Because many famous titles nowadays

226
0:7:42,709 --> 0:7:44,389
Like The Witcher 3 and such

227
0:7:44,389 --> 0:7:45,809
Like Baldur's Gate

228
0:7:45,809 --> 0:7:46,84
And so on

229
0:7:46,84 --> 0:7:48,68
Many of them are multilingual

230
0:7:48,68 --> 0:7:49,92
You can use multiple languages

231
0:7:49,92 --> 0:7:51,24
Isn't Kingdoms and Castles the same?

232
0:7:51,24 --> 0:7:52,26
Multiple languages

233
0:7:52,26 --> 0:7:53,26
After using multiple languages

234
0:7:53,26 --> 0:7:54,26
The voice acting is different

235
0:7:54,26 --> 0:7:56,36
The text used is different

236
0:7:56,36 --> 0:7:57,9
Keep repeating this process

237
0:7:57,9 --> 0:7:59,48
Gradually, you'll learn the language

238
0:7:59,48 --> 0:8:1,4
Just like when people watch movies

239
0:8:1,4 --> 0:8:1,6
Or anime

240
0:8:1,6 --> 0:8:4,12
You pick up a bit of Japanese

241
0:8:4,12 --> 0:8:6,419
You'll understand, right?

242
0:8:6,419 --> 0:8:8,439
So these things are a process of osmosis

243
0:8:8,439 --> 0:8:9,65
A process

244
0:8:9,65 --> 0:8:11,69
This episode is titled 'I Can't Do It'

245
0:8:11,69 --> 0:8:12,85
To attract everyone

246
0:8:12,85 --> 0:8:13,87
But it's okay

247
0:8:13,87 --> 0:8:15,17
When I can't do it

248
0:8:15,17 --> 0:8:18,35
In the end, you'll find that there are new things you can do

249
0:8:18,35 --> 0:8:18,98
Right?

250
0:8:18,98 --> 0:8:20,86
So sometimes feeling capable or not

251
0:8:20,86 --> 0:8:22,22
Is just a matter of mindset

252
0:8:22,22 --> 0:8:25,78
When your thinking shifts and your threshold rises, many things

253
0:8:25,78 --> 0:8:27,28
Gradually feel different

254
0:8:27,28 --> 0:8:28,2
It's you who has changed

255
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:29,54
The world hasn't changed

256
0:8:29,54 --> 0:8:31,84
I hope everyone is happy every day

257
0:8:31,84 --> 0:8:33,4
And if you're not happy

258
0:8:33,4 --> 0:8:34,72
