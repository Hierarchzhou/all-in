1
0:0:0,32 --> 0:0:1,28
Hey everyone,

2
0:0:1,28 --> 0:0:2,94
today we're going to talk about

3
0:0:2,94 --> 0:0:6,46
which social class

4
0:0:6,46 --> 0:0:9,34
is the most unfortunate in society.

5
0:0:9,34 --> 0:0:11,68
We're talking about the middle class.

6
0:0:11,68 --> 0:0:13,86
First, let's look at Western countries.

7
0:0:13,86 --> 0:0:18,14
I'll use a Western country I'm very familiar with as an example.

8
0:0:18,14 --> 0:0:19,78
For instance, Canada.

9
0:0:19,78 --> 0:0:23,16
Canada is a country that has gradually achieved

10
0:0:23,16 --> 0:0:26,26
You could say that it achieves a society where warmth is evenly distributed everywhere.

11
0:0:26,26 --> 0:0:28,92
A society where everyone stays warm no matter where they are.

12
0:0:28,92 --> 0:0:30,16
And then there's France.

13
0:0:30,16 --> 0:0:33,96
France is also where I received various subsidies when I was there.

14
0:0:33,96 --> 0:0:35,78
It was incredibly, incredibly fulfilling.

15
0:0:35,78 --> 0:0:37,4
In these two societies,

16
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:41,1
the main feeling I had was that being a worker is truly a blissful experience.

17
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:44,32
But you need to understand that in both of these societies,

18
0:0:44,32 --> 0:0:45,6
being a worker

19
0:0:45,6 --> 0:0:46,96
As a middle-class individual,

20
0:0:46,96 --> 0:0:51,2
you bear the majority of the welfare expenses in society.

21
0:0:51,2 --> 0:0:53,84
This means that in this society,

22
0:0:53,84 --> 0:0:56,48
your tax contributions are fixed,

23
0:0:56,48 --> 0:0:57,5
including consumption tax,

24
0:0:57,5 --> 0:0:58,4
sales tax,

25
0:0:58,4 --> 0:0:59,28
payroll tax,

26
0:0:59,28 --> 0:0:59,94
income tax,

27
0:0:59,94 --> 0:1:1,39
and a variety of other taxes.

28
0:1:1,39 --> 0:1:3,67
You'll find that every country

29
0:1:3,67 --> 0:1:6,45
has its own national anthem

30
0:1:6,45 --> 0:1:11,7
but they all tend to target the middle class

31
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:13,83
Japanese society also targets the middle class

32
0:1:13,83 --> 0:1:16,8
who has read enough books

33
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:19,0
who takes on white-collar jobs

34
0:1:19,0 --> 0:1:23,38
he is the most stable petit bourgeois

35
0:1:23,38 --> 0:1:25,24
the middle class is the most stable

36
0:1:25,24 --> 0:1:27,68
because they have a certain amount of property

37
0:1:27,68 --> 0:1:29,52
He has his own little house.

38
0:1:29,52 --> 0:1:31,2
He has his own little mouse nest.

39
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:32,88
He needs to maintain this little mouse nest.

40
0:1:32,88 --> 0:1:34,6
He also pays the mortgage.

41
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:34,48
And the car loan.

42
0:1:34,48 --> 0:1:36,4
Living his American Dream.

43
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:36,789
That's how it is.

44
0:1:36,789 --> 0:1:38,629
America also exploits the middle class.

45
0:1:38,629 --> 0:1:41,469
You'll find that the middle class bears the most responsibilities.

46
0:1:41,469 --> 0:1:43,86
The children of the middle class go to war

47
0:1:43,86 --> 0:1:45,62
The children of the middle class

48
0:1:45,62 --> 0:1:48,16
spend this money to pay the highest taxes

49
0:1:48,16 --> 0:1:52,83
The middle class pays the greatest price for the school districts in Haidian District

50
0:1:52,83 --> 0:1:56,39
You'll find that the middle class is in every country

51
0:1:56,39 --> 0:1:59,7
is the most underappreciated class

52
0:1:59,7 --> 0:2:1,54
has no social status

53
0:2:1,54 --> 0:2:2,92
has no political power

54
0:2:2,92 --> 0:2:6,2
There's nothing that compensates the middle class

55
0:2:6,2 --> 0:2:8,9
And the middle class pays the most taxes.

56
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:9,73
It's often not the rich.

57
0:2:9,73 --> 0:2:10,73
The rich, well,

58
0:2:10,73 --> 0:2:13,1
People say you should pay more if you earn more.

59
0:2:13,1 --> 0:2:15,61
But does earning more really mean you should pay more?

60
0:2:15,61 --> 0:2:17,39
Bro Rong paid his this month.

61
0:2:17,39 --> 0:2:18,65
Well, how do you put it?

62
0:2:18,65 --> 0:2:21,34
What kind of income tax is being paid?

63
0:2:21,34 --> 0:2:23,0
It's the personal income tax being paid.

64
0:2:23,0 --> 0:2:25,72
Corporate income tax and value-added tax

65
0:2:25,72 --> 0:2:27,4
Issued invoices are subject to value-added tax

66
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:30,62
These three taxes have similar rates

67
0:2:30,62 --> 0:2:32,39
But the issue is

68
0:2:32,39 --> 0:2:35,63
The threshold for corporate income tax is quite low

69
0:2:35,63 --> 0:2:38,23
For personal income tax, you need to pay yourself a high salary

70
0:2:38,23 --> 0:2:40,6
Which makes the tax rate quite high

71
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:43,34
In so-called developed countries

72
0:2:43,34 --> 0:2:43,94
Like the United States

73
0:2:43,94 --> 0:2:45,8
a country like Canada

74
0:2:45,8 --> 0:2:46,47
a country like Japan

75
0:2:46,47 --> 0:2:48,25
your personal situation

76
0:2:48,25 --> 0:2:49,59
if you earn more money

77
0:2:49,59 --> 0:2:51,55
you have to pay a substantial amount of taxes

78
0:2:51,55 --> 0:2:53,3
to be honest, in our country

79
0:2:53,3 --> 0:2:56,89
many people constantly criticize China online

80
0:2:56,89 --> 0:2:59,199
but from a taxpayer's perspective

81
0:2:59,199 --> 0:3:3,299
China, whether for the middle class or entrepreneurs

82
0:3:3,299 --> 0:3:5,3
Especially for small businesses

83
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:6,4
Policy incentives

84
0:3:6,4 --> 0:3:8,769
Tax breaks are real and substantial

85
0:3:8,769 --> 0:3:11,289
Unlike some Western countries

86
0:3:11,289 --> 0:3:13,229
Full of sweet talk

87
0:3:13,229 --> 0:3:15,78
Praising our system in all sorts of ways

88
0:3:15,78 --> 0:3:20,88
But if you underreport or make a mistake in your tax calculation

89
0:3:20,88 --> 0:3:22,36
You'll get audited

90
0:3:22,36 --> 0:3:23,88
They'll investigate your taxes

91
0:3:23,88 --> 0:3:25,48
Then this method could make you lose everything

92
0:3:25,48 --> 0:3:27,42
or even land you in jail

93
0:3:27,42 --> 0:3:28,94
In a high-welfare society

94
0:3:28,94 --> 0:3:32,34
most people talk about the benefits of such a society

95
0:3:32,34 --> 0:3:35,8
but rarely mention the class barriers in a high-welfare society

96
0:3:35,8 --> 0:3:39,28
or the high taxes in such a society

97
0:3:39,28 --> 0:3:41,5
Actually, to avoid high taxes

98
0:3:41,5 --> 0:3:45,18
many people in the U.S. often move around

99
0:3:45,18 --> 0:3:47,8
relocating to states with lower taxes

100
0:3:47,8 --> 0:3:49,5
Moving to states with relatively higher incomes

101
0:3:49,5 --> 0:3:52,1
It’s essentially a lifetime of constant relocation

102
0:3:52,1 --> 0:3:53,49
Being deeply rooted in one’s homeland

103
0:3:53,49 --> 0:3:55,21
is not a common practice for them

104
0:3:55,21 --> 0:3:58,93
It’s quite normal for people to move for economic opportunities

105
0:3:58,93 --> 0:4:1,329
So many people are hesitant to buy homes

106
0:4:1,329 --> 0:4:2,489
They prefer renting

107
0:4:2,489 --> 0:4:4,929
Because buying a home ties you down to a specific place

108
0:4:4,929 --> 0:4:6,249
So if you rent, you have more flexibility

109
0:4:6,249 --> 0:4:8,19
There's a lot of freedom to move around

110
0:4:8,19 --> 0:4:10,67
A lot of times, earthquakes, tsunamis, and fires occur

111
0:4:10,67 --> 0:4:11,95
You can just pack up and leave

112
0:4:11,95 --> 0:4:12,67
Right?

113
0:4:12,67 --> 0:4:14,59
What can they do, withhold my deposit?

114
0:4:14,59 --> 0:4:15,39
Ha, what can they do?

115
0:4:15,39 --> 0:4:15,87
One month deposit, one month rent

116
0:4:15,87 --> 0:4:16,35
One month deposit, three months rent

117
0:4:16,35 --> 0:4:17,51
Aren't you also on a one-month deposit?

118
0:4:17,51 --> 0:4:18,22
Is that right?

119
0:4:18,22 --> 0:4:20,52
So, a lot of the time we say,

120
0:4:20,52 --> 0:4:22,38
Even though we often don't appreciate what we have,

121
0:4:22,38 --> 0:4:26,38
But we also say that every country tends to exploit the middle class,

122
0:4:26,38 --> 0:4:29,14
As an educated and cultured person,

123
0:4:29,14 --> 0:4:30,3
You have been shaped by society,

124
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:32,78
By an educational system that has conditioned you for decades,

125
0:4:32,78 --> 0:4:35,709
You would realize that for society,

126
0:4:35,709 --> 0:4:37,98
It's quite easy to take advantage of you.

127
0:4:37,98 --> 0:4:39,56
Because you follow the rules

128
0:4:39,56 --> 0:4:41,18
Because you are particularly rule-abiding

129
0:4:41,18 --> 0:4:43,53
Because you have a strong tendency to avoid mistakes

130
0:4:43,53 --> 0:4:46,37
If a person can't learn to separate issues

131
0:4:46,37 --> 0:4:47,789
Then they are doomed

132
0:4:47,789 --> 0:4:50,329
And over the years, this kind of education

133
0:4:50,329 --> 0:4:51,309
The school system

134
0:4:51,309 --> 0:4:53,659
Parents will tell you all sorts of things

135
0:4:53,659 --> 0:4:54,899
Making you say 'Oh'

136
0:4:54,899 --> 0:4:57,379
You just need to focus on your studies.

137
0:4:57,379 --> 0:4:58,639
Don't worry about anything else.

138
0:4:58,639 --> 0:4:59,499
Don't start dating too early.

139
0:4:59,499 --> 0:5:0,14
Oh!

140
0:5:0,14 --> 0:5:2,24
Your parents are scrimping and saving for you, you know.

141
0:5:2,24 --> 0:5:3,9
They just want you to go to a good university.

142
0:5:3,9 --> 0:5:4,62
Get a good job.

143
0:5:4,62 --> 0:5:5,48
Find a stable job.

144
0:5:5,48 --> 0:5:6,9
Go for a master’s degree first, then consider a public service career.

145
0:5:6,9 --> 0:5:9,28
The last one is just like a green onion.

146
0:5:9,28 --> 0:5:11,74
Is it exactly like that?

147
0:5:11,74 --> 0:5:12,98
So he has a lot of things.

148
0:5:12,98 --> 0:5:14,6
He uses all sorts of things,

149
0:5:14,6 --> 0:5:19,42
the guilt trip uses all these things,

150
0:5:19,42 --> 0:5:20,94
You fear making mistakes.

151
0:5:20,94 --> 0:5:22,64
You have to take responsibility.

152
0:5:22,64 --> 0:5:26,38
So the educated middle class,

153
0:5:26,38 --> 0:5:31,17
in various countries, are the most severely PUAed group.

154
0:5:31,17 --> 0:5:33,47
Whether it's the middle class in Canada

155
0:5:33,47 --> 0:5:35,2
the middle class in the United States

156
0:5:35,2 --> 0:5:38,4
the middle class in Japan, or the middle class in China

157
0:5:38,4 --> 0:5:41,52
you'll find that the middle class is the one truly burdened with mortgages

158
0:5:41,52 --> 0:5:43,159
and car loans

159
0:5:43,159 --> 0:5:46,639
paying the real price for consumerism

160
0:5:46,639 --> 0:5:50,6
whether you have children or not

161
0:5:50,6 --> 0:5:53,52
you will bear the economic cost

162
0:5:53,52 --> 0:5:54,48
because you don't have children

163
0:5:54,48 --> 0:5:55,58
You enjoy life.

164
0:5:55,58 --> 0:5:56,62
You travel abroad.

165
0:5:56,62 --> 0:5:58,26
You buy all sorts of cosmetics.

166
0:5:58,26 --> 0:5:59,66
You buy all kinds of clothes.

167
0:5:59,66 --> 0:6:1,0
You buy Xiaomi Sochi 7.

168
0:6:1,0 --> 0:6:2,72
Because the Xiaomi Sochi 7 for you,

169
0:6:2,72 --> 0:6:4,92
is like an Android phone in the world of cars.

170
0:6:4,92 --> 0:6:5,5
Right?

171
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:8,21
You think you like the Xiaomi brand.

172
0:6:8,21 --> 0:6:9,35
You buy a graphics card

173
0:6:9,35 --> 0:6:11,1
You buy all sorts of grains

174
0:6:11,1 --> 0:6:12,81
You buy all kinds of flash cards

175
0:6:12,81 --> 0:6:13,37
Right?

176
0:6:13,37 --> 0:6:15,3
You buy all sorts of models

177
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:16,42
Right, you go get a foot massage

178
0:6:16,42 --> 0:6:19,2
You're contributing to society in your own way

179
0:6:19,2 --> 0:6:21,24
And the grassroots are the ones not to be messed with

180
0:6:21,24 --> 0:6:23,74
They are the genuine manual laborers

181
0:6:23,74 --> 0:6:28,84
The uneducated among the underclass are the hardest to pacify.

182
0:6:28,84 --> 0:6:31,93
So, at the bottom of society in various countries

183
0:6:31,93 --> 0:6:32,61
whether in France,

184
0:6:32,61 --> 0:6:33,55
whether in Canada,

185
0:6:33,55 --> 0:6:34,87
or in China,

186
0:6:34,87 --> 0:6:37,43
the underprivileged are taken care of,

187
0:6:37,43 --> 0:6:39,48
they are the ones receiving welfare.

188
0:6:39,48 --> 0:6:41,94
Where does the welfare for these recipients come from?

189
0:6:41,94 --> 0:6:43,66
Could it be from the rich?

190
0:6:43,66 --> 0:6:46,119
It's not all brought by the middle class.

191
0:6:46,119 --> 0:6:50,33
So you need to understand that the most unfortunate group in society is the middle class.

192
0:6:50,33 --> 0:6:53,51
The most unfortunate are those who have received the most education.

193
0:6:53,51 --> 0:6:56,21
the audience in front of my television

194
0:6:56,21 --> 0:6:57,22
These followers

195
0:6:57,22 --> 0:6:59,46
You are the most unfortunate people.

196
0:6:59,46 --> 0:7:1,22
Because you're not at the bottom.

197
0:7:1,22 --> 0:7:2,73
You've been to school.

198
0:7:2,73 --> 0:7:4,9
You've read books.

199
0:7:4,9 --> 0:7:6,7
You won't randomly bring good movies.

200
0:7:6,7 --> 0:7:9,53
You won't do anything particularly embarrassing.

201
0:7:9,53 --> 0:7:11,64
Because that's not what a scholar would do.

202
0:7:11,64 --> 0:7:13,98
You think the story of Fan Jin passing the imperial exam is about Fan Jin.

203
0:7:13,98 --> 0:7:16,44
But in fact, you are Fan Jin.

204
0:7:16,44 --> 0:7:18,2
Is it K'ung I-Chi?

205
0:7:18,2 --> 0:7:18,86
It's you.

206
0:7:18,86 --> 0:7:20,84
See, Fan Jin is you.

207
0:7:20,84 --> 0:7:23,71
Because you won't do what scholars wouldn't do.

208
0:7:23,71 --> 0:7:27,15
The real street vendors and peddlers

209
0:7:27,15 --> 0:7:31,69
often have a higher chance of becoming small business owners in the future

210
0:7:31,69 --> 0:7:35,38
your so-called reliance on material things

211
0:7:35,38 --> 0:7:36,26
what do you really know

212
0:7:36,26 --> 0:7:37,92
all you know is taking the civil service exam and joining big companies

213
0:7:37,92 --> 0:7:38,7
attending prestigious universities like Tsinghua and Peking

214
0:7:38,7 --> 0:7:39,45
right

215
0:7:39,45 --> 0:7:40,97
what do the Japanese really know

216
0:7:40,97 --> 0:7:42,29
getting into Tokyo University, right

217
0:7:42,29 --> 0:7:42,97
Get into Tokyo University

218
0:7:42,97 --> 0:7:44,59
Then go to Tokyo, right?

219
0:7:44,59 --> 0:7:47,7
Similarly, the French know that going to Paris means attending the Sorbonne

220
0:7:47,7 --> 0:7:47,57
Right?

221
0:7:47,57 --> 0:7:51,1
And Americans know that attending the Ivy League is the equivalent of going to the Sorbonne

222
0:7:51,1 --> 0:7:51,99
Right?

223
0:7:51,99 --> 0:7:53,75
And then in the future, head to Silicon Valley

224
0:7:53,75 --> 0:7:55,59
Or various financial districts in New York

225
0:7:55,59 --> 0:7:56,28
That’s how it goes

226
0:7:56,28 --> 0:7:58,4
So all these middle-class individuals

227
0:7:58,4 --> 0:8:1,43
have a significant income dependency

228
0:8:1,43 --> 0:8:4,93
and a great deal of responsibility

229
0:8:4,93 --> 0:8:6,67
this sense of responsibility

230
0:8:6,67 --> 0:8:9,81
responsibility is something that has been created

231
0:8:9,81 --> 0:8:12,73
there was no middle class in the past

232
0:8:12,73 --> 0:8:15,65
because the commercial and industrial sectors were not well-developed

233
0:8:15,65 --> 0:8:17,75
it was mostly workers and peasants

234
0:8:17,75 --> 0:8:21,87
craftsmen and farmers who didn't receive education either

235
0:8:21,87 --> 0:8:24,45
Craftsmen just need to pass down their skills.

236
0:8:24,45 --> 0:8:26,45
Farmers, on the other hand, have those things.

237
0:8:26,45 --> 0:8:27,45
The productive force is also low.

238
0:8:27,45 --> 0:8:28,53
They don’t even need to operate the lunar calendar.

239
0:8:28,53 --> 0:8:30,76
Machinery back then was completely different from now.

240
0:8:30,76 --> 0:8:32,7
And now these intelligentsia

241
0:8:32,7 --> 0:8:33,82
to be honest,

242
0:8:35,43 --> 0:8:37,75
The intelligentsia can indeed be easily manipulated.

243
0:8:37,75 --> 0:8:40,99
Because the intelligentsia are the most responsible

244
0:8:40,99 --> 0:8:42,239
The intelligentsia uphold rites, justice, integrity, and a sense of honor.

245
0:8:42,239 --> 0:8:43,759
These things are particularly effective.

246
0:8:43,759 --> 0:8:47,12
The intelligentsia must fear class decline the most.

247
0:8:47,12 --> 0:8:49,12
They must not be like manual laborers.

248
0:8:49,12 --> 0:8:51,65
So they are the easiest to control.

249
0:8:51,65 --> 0:8:53,35
A little intimidation goes a long way.

250
0:8:53,35 --> 0:8:54,71
A little intimidation goes a long way.

251
0:8:54,71 --> 0:8:58,8
So the intelligentsia fear being intimidated the most.

252
0:8:58,8 --> 0:9:0,76
Then, like the intelligentsia in Japan

253
0:9:0,76 --> 0:9:3,56
what they fear most is being ostracized by society.

254
0:9:3,56 --> 0:9:4,6
By these etiquettes,

255
0:9:4,6 --> 0:9:6,94
and those moral codes that guide and belong to them.

256
0:9:6,94 --> 0:9:8,6
So, to put it simply,

257
0:9:8,6 --> 0:9:10,52
the truly wealthy don’t pay taxes.

258
0:9:10,52 --> 0:9:12,589
The truly wealthy don’t follow the rules.

259
0:9:12,589 --> 0:9:14,53
The lower class also don’t follow the rules.

260
0:9:14,53 --> 0:9:15,45
Those who follow the rules,

261
0:9:15,45 --> 0:9:18,65
are these poor and pitiful economic slaves,

262
0:9:18,65 --> 0:9:20,8
also known as the middle class.
