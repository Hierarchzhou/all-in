1
0:0:0,9 --> 0:0:3,78
The beekeepers take the honey away

2
0:0:3,78 --> 0:0:6,22
What do the bees eat then?

3
0:0:6,54 --> 0:0:10,58
But if you give the honey back to the bees,

4
0:0:10,58 --> 0:0:13,38
What would the beekeepers eat?

5
0:0:13,38 --> 0:0:17,24
This is an age-old inequality.

6
0:0:17,24 --> 0:0:21,22
Is the bee colony living for the beekeepers?

7
0:0:21,22 --> 0:0:24,79
Are beekeepers really keeping bees or harming them?

8
0:0:24,79 --> 0:0:27,31
This is an age-old paradox.

9
0:0:27,31 --> 0:0:30,33
I always take out the trash whenever I go out.

10
0:0:30,33 --> 0:0:34,11
The type of person I hate the most is someone who asks me if they should throw away their trash.

11
0:0:34,11 --> 0:0:36,14
Because when I watch short videos, they tell me,

12
0:0:36,14 --> 0:0:39,4
if I give them my trash,

13
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:41,43
and they use it or eat something from it,

14
0:0:41,43 --> 0:0:45,1
and then get sick,

15
0:0:45,1 --> 0:0:45,55
they might sue me.

16
0:0:45,55 --> 0:0:46,91
I thought, 'How can someone be so nasty?'

17
0:0:46,91 --> 0:0:50,46
So every time, I make sure to walk carefully to the garbage station.

18
0:0:50,46 --> 0:0:54,13
So, I always make a point to walk to the waste station carefully.

19
0:0:54,13 --> 0:0:55,19
Throw the trash down

20
0:0:55,19 --> 0:0:56,57
Then wait for them to pick it up

21
0:0:56,57 --> 0:0:58,97
Absolutely avoid any conversation with them

22
0:0:58,97 --> 0:1:0,93
Later, I observed these people carefully

23
0:1:0,93 --> 0:1:3,58
I found them so peculiar

24
0:1:3,58 --> 0:1:6,52
Why did their accents sound so different from mine?

25
0:1:6,52 --> 0:1:7,5
Then I realized

26
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:11,11
Many people's lives are completely different from mine

27
0:1:11,11 --> 0:1:12,61
When I was bored

28
0:1:12,61 --> 0:1:14,43
run to the nearby Small Park

29
0:1:14,43 --> 0:1:16,19
to watch the seniors exercise

30
0:1:16,19 --> 0:1:17,68
that's when I noticed

31
0:1:17,68 --> 0:1:19,94
even though they're all seniors

32
0:1:19,94 --> 0:1:23,15
there are two completely different outcomes

33
0:1:23,15 --> 0:1:25,75
some seniors, like my parents

34
0:1:25,75 --> 0:1:27,85
and all my relatives

35
0:1:27,85 --> 0:1:30,84
worked at various organizations when they were young

36
0:1:30,84 --> 0:1:33,12
and now they have a stable pension

37
0:1:33,12 --> 0:1:34,69
So when we get old,

38
0:1:34,69 --> 0:1:37,85
we could either join others in square dancing,

39
0:1:37,85 --> 0:1:38,91
or ballroom dancing,

40
0:1:38,91 --> 0:1:39,95
go out for photography,

41
0:1:39,95 --> 0:1:40,55
walk our birds,

42
0:1:40,55 --> 0:1:41,44
go fishing,

43
0:1:41,44 --> 0:1:43,0
or we could be like my parents,

44
0:1:43,0 --> 0:1:44,54
watching short dramas at home,

45
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:45,72
or listening to storytelling.

46
0:1:48,98 --> 0:1:50,479
Life is quite laid-back.

47
0:1:50,479 --> 0:1:52,639
But there are other elderly folks.

48
0:1:52,639 --> 0:1:55,229
You'll find the old men doing odd jobs.

49
0:1:55,229 --> 0:1:56,129
Temporary work, you know.

50
0:1:56,129 --> 0:1:57,709
In their seventies or so.

51
0:1:57,709 --> 0:1:59,9
Still working on road repairs.

52
0:1:59,9 --> 0:2:0,21
Still digging holes.

53
0:2:0,21 --> 0:2:1,61
Still picking up trash.

54
0:2:1,61 --> 0:2:4,13
And the old ladies, they're not just cleaning toilets.

55
0:2:4,13 --> 0:2:6,89
They are picking up all sorts of discarded bottles and such.

56
0:2:6,89 --> 0:2:8,19
Or they might be looking after children for others.

57
0:2:8,19 --> 0:2:11,38
Or they could be doing all kinds of domestic work.

58
0:2:11,38 --> 0:2:13,78
You'll find that these aunts and uncles,

59
0:2:13,78 --> 0:2:17,47
these grandmas, you can actually encounter them in various malls.

60
0:2:17,47 --> 0:2:19,71
You’re bound to run into them when you use the restroom.

61
0:2:19,71 --> 0:2:20,97
Sometimes it’s an old man,

62
0:2:20,97 --> 0:2:23,35
and sometimes it’s an old woman in the restroom.

63
0:2:23,35 --> 0:2:25,47
And then there’s the subway station.

64
0:2:25,47 --> 0:2:26,99
These spots for transportation

65
0:2:26,99 --> 0:2:28,51
like the library and concert hall

66
0:2:28,51 --> 0:2:30,61
you're likely to encounter someone taking a single ride

67
0:2:30,61 --> 0:2:34,21
So, we're back to the initial question

68
0:2:34,21 --> 0:2:37,55
Is the beekeeper's goal to produce honey for consumption

69
0:2:37,55 --> 0:2:39,7
or to raise bees?

70
0:2:39,7 --> 0:2:40,99
Why are they called beekeepers?

71
0:2:40,99 --> 0:2:45,22
Who ultimately gets the honey produced by the bees?

72
0:2:45,22 --> 0:2:47,2
You need to think carefully about this question

73
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:49,519
Actually, if you look at these elderly men and women, many of them

74
0:2:49,519 --> 0:2:51,479
they enjoy, well, how can I put it,

75
0:2:52,599 --> 0:2:54,919
they basically don't have any pension.

76
0:2:54,919 --> 0:2:56,64
Farmers have it very tough,

77
0:2:56,64 --> 0:2:58,8
so when they get old,

78
0:2:58,8 --> 0:2:59,96
they have no choice but to continue working,

79
0:2:59,96 --> 0:3:0,94
they have to keep working,

80
0:3:0,94 --> 0:3:3,11
to support their entire family.

81
0:3:3,11 --> 0:3:5,23
Of course, every rural area is different.

82
0:3:5,23 --> 0:3:6,47
There are wealthy and poor areas in the countryside

83
0:3:6,47 --> 0:3:7,83
but for most people

84
0:3:7,83 --> 0:3:9,46
they still need to work

85
0:3:9,46 --> 0:3:11,54
they still need to use this method of working

86
0:3:11,54 --> 0:3:12,64
either by begging

87
0:3:12,64 --> 0:3:13,8
or working

88
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:16,8
or by various means to support their families

89
0:3:16,8 --> 0:3:17,24
selling some goods

90
0:3:17,24 --> 0:3:20,24
so this is the significant difference between rural and urban areas

91
0:3:20,24 --> 0:3:22,88
The significant differences brought by different identities

92
0:3:22,88 --> 0:3:24,68
When you think about it every day

93
0:3:24,68 --> 0:3:26,2
I want to drive a Lamborghini

94
0:3:26,2 --> 0:3:27,5
I want to live in a spacious apartment

95
0:3:27,5 --> 0:3:30,26
When I want to buy a house in Vancouver

96
0:3:30,26 --> 0:3:32,58
Don't forget about many of your fellow countrymen

97
0:3:32,58 --> 0:3:34,9
Who are still in such a survival situation

98
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:36,76
Your parents

99
0:3:36,76 --> 0:3:39,24
For the majority of our audience's parents

100
0:3:39,24 --> 0:3:40,88
Actually, it's pretty similar to my parents.

101
0:3:40,88 --> 0:3:42,16
When it comes to daily life,

102
0:3:42,16 --> 0:3:44,38
it's relatively stable,

103
0:3:44,38 --> 0:3:45,52
not exactly luxurious,

104
0:3:45,52 --> 0:3:46,57
but stable at least.

105
0:3:46,57 --> 0:3:49,81
But this person is afraid of comparisons,

106
0:3:49,81 --> 0:3:50,79
when you compare,

107
0:3:50,79 --> 0:3:51,61
you realize,

108
0:3:51,61 --> 0:3:54,44
society never really lives up to our so-called ideals.

109
0:3:54,44 --> 0:3:55,64
Absolute fairness

110
0:3:55,64 --> 0:3:56,4
Continuous development

111
0:3:56,4 --> 0:3:57,96
This phase is relative

112
0:3:57,96 --> 0:4:2,319
When I was young, I had the opportunity to study in North America

113
0:4:2,319 --> 0:4:4,339
It was actually a chance encounter

114
0:4:4,339 --> 0:4:7,59
But the home front remains our honest truth

115
0:4:7,59 --> 0:4:8,17
A commonly used phrase

116
0:4:8,17 --> 0:4:9,93
They sold everything to send me to school

117
0:4:9,93 --> 0:4:12,6
It was indeed very tough

118
0:4:12,6 --> 0:4:14,38
But it opened my eyes to a whole new world.

119
0:4:14,38 --> 0:4:15,34
You'll notice,

120
0:4:15,34 --> 0:4:16,8
in areas with a high concentration of Chinese people,

121
0:4:16,8 --> 0:4:18,2
like New York and Los Angeles,

122
0:4:18,2 --> 0:4:18,56
Vancouver,

123
0:4:18,56 --> 0:4:19,88
Toronto, and places like that,

124
0:4:19,88 --> 0:4:21,66
you'll see the majority of

125
0:4:21,66 --> 0:4:25,5
all the social strata from Chinese society,

126
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:27,2
from the lower-income individuals

127
0:4:27,2 --> 0:4:28,56
They started working after they came out

128
0:4:28,56 --> 0:4:30,22
and then rose to the middle class

129
0:4:30,22 --> 0:4:33,42
These people continued working in middle-class jobs after they came out

130
0:4:33,42 --> 0:4:35,72
and felt their social status rise to the upper class

131
0:4:35,72 --> 0:4:36,92
These wealthy individuals came out

132
0:4:36,92 --> 0:4:37,82
buying things

133
0:4:37,82 --> 0:4:39,89
buying apartments and houses

134
0:4:40,25 --> 0:4:41,21
spending extravagantly

135
0:4:41,21 --> 0:4:42,93
you would find it's completely different

136
0:4:42,93 --> 0:4:44,59
When living in the country

137
0:4:44,59 --> 0:4:45,37
Generally speaking

138
0:4:45,37 --> 0:4:46,49
Due to the large population

139
0:4:46,49 --> 0:4:47,77
Because of the numerous cities

140
0:4:47,77 --> 0:4:50,1
Due to the segregation of social circles

141
0:4:50,1 --> 0:4:51,8
You don’t run into these people

142
0:4:51,8 --> 0:4:53,24
But when it comes to living abroad

143
0:4:53,24 --> 0:4:53,72
I mentioned

144
0:4:53,72 --> 0:4:55,28
In a city like Vancouver

145
0:4:55,28 --> 0:4:56,7
There's a high concentration of Chinese people.

146
0:4:56,7 --> 0:4:59,24
So you'll always encounter people from different social strata.

147
0:4:59,24 --> 0:5:1,87
Wealthy individuals from various regions.

148
0:5:1,87 --> 0:5:4,3
This can shape your values.

149
0:5:4,3 --> 0:5:5,94
It can have a significant impact on your worldview.

150
0:5:5,94 --> 0:5:8,62
All the wealthy people tend to gather in one city.

151
0:5:8,62 --> 0:5:10,49
What happens then?

152
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:13,509
This is when class conflicts become evident.

153
0:5:13,509 --> 0:5:15,449
Of course, there are also cultural clashes in the area.

154
0:5:15,449 --> 0:5:16,62
There are racial conflicts

155
0:5:16,62 --> 0:5:17,74
There are class conflicts

156
0:5:17,74 --> 0:5:19,54
At such times, things get really interesting

157
0:5:19,54 --> 0:5:21,1
So it helps me understand

158
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:24,1
Actually, transcending class mentality is quite common

159
0:5:24,1 --> 0:5:25,64
Throughout my life

160
0:5:25,64 --> 0:5:27,62
If you talk about absolute fairness

161
0:5:27,62 --> 0:5:28,56
Absolute justice

162
0:5:28,56 --> 0:5:29,2
Then let me tell you

163
0:5:29,2 --> 0:5:30,86
Doing this is absolutely futile.

164
0:5:30,86 --> 0:5:34,86
Because most people don't want to change the status quo.

165
0:5:34,86 --> 0:5:37,84
And absolute fairness will never truly exist.

166
0:5:37,84 --> 0:5:39,76
There's something you need to understand.

167
0:5:39,76 --> 0:5:42,92
The people you think are exploiting others now,

168
0:5:42,92 --> 0:5:45,56
were actually in a state of being exploited in the past.

169
0:5:45,56 --> 0:5:48,18
Many things are just a matter of perspective.

170
0:5:48,18 --> 0:5:51,48
The previously oppressed individuals are now in power.

171
0:5:51,48 --> 0:5:52,52
Once they rise to power,

172
0:5:52,52 --> 0:5:53,7
He continues to exploit

173
0:5:53,7 --> 0:5:54,6
Carry on with new people

174
0:5:54,6 --> 0:5:55,92
So in many cases

175
0:5:55,92 --> 0:5:57,32
In a capitalist society

176
0:5:57,32 --> 0:5:59,26
These relations of production won't change

177
0:5:59,26 --> 0:6:2,7
But what can we do in our limited lives?

178
0:6:2,7 --> 0:6:5,14
For example, we can do things like Pangdolai

179
0:6:5,14 --> 0:6:8,11
Provide more equitable job opportunities for society

180
0:6:8,11 --> 0:6:9,95
There's also something I often mention

181
0:6:9,95 --> 0:6:11,23
You can establish a foundation.

182
0:6:11,23 --> 0:6:14,49
With 2 million, 4 million, or 8 million to set up a foundation.

183
0:6:14,49 --> 0:6:15,55
Save a lot of money.

184
0:6:15,55 --> 0:6:19,66
And then provide dedicated assistance to these people through the foundation.

185
0:6:19,66 --> 0:6:20,56
As a person,

186
0:6:23,34 --> 0:6:24,76
just like environmental protection,

187
0:6:24,76 --> 0:6:26,33
in many cases,

188
0:6:26,33 --> 0:6:28,21
we don't need to talk about the greenhouse effect anymore,

189
0:6:28,21 --> 0:6:29,35
from 2019 to now.

190
0:6:29,35 --> 0:6:31,77
Every day is marked by extreme heat.

191
0:6:31,77 --> 0:6:36,33
Actually, humans once had a chance to restore the Earth's ecosystem.

192
0:6:36,33 --> 0:6:38,9
But we missed that opportunity forever.

193
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:39,67
So, in reality,

194
0:6:39,67 --> 0:6:40,95
as a human being,

195
0:6:40,95 --> 0:6:44,32
let alone being a young life,

196
0:6:44,32 --> 0:6:46,87
what you can do,

197
0:6:46,87 --> 0:6:50,77
just surviving is already a significant challenge.

198
0:6:50,77 --> 0:6:52,63
So, in our lives,

199
0:6:52,63 --> 0:6:53,79
In our finite lives,

200
0:6:53,79 --> 0:6:54,77
we need to understand,

201
0:6:54,77 --> 0:6:58,79
you will have to coexist with all sorts of things you disapprove of,

202
0:6:58,79 --> 0:6:59,91
negative phenomena,

203
0:6:59,91 --> 0:7:2,66
or what you believe should not exist in an ideal society,

204
0:7:2,66 --> 0:7:3,78
in the books you read,

205
0:7:3,78 --> 0:7:4,46
in your school,

206
0:7:4,46 --> 0:7:5,1
in the education system,

207
0:7:5,1 --> 0:7:6,36
things you cannot see.

208
0:7:6,36 --> 0:7:8,9
But still, as I mentioned at the beginning

209
0:7:8,9 --> 0:7:10,78
There are so many people like this

210
0:7:10,78 --> 0:7:13,98
At first, you see them as part of the intelligentsia

211
0:7:13,98 --> 0:7:15,69
As a child of the middle class

212
0:7:15,69 --> 0:7:17,57
Don't deny that you're middle class

213
0:7:17,57 --> 0:7:18,85
If you weren't middle class

214
0:7:18,85 --> 0:7:20,43
You wouldn't be watching Bilibili

215
0:7:20,43 --> 0:7:22,39
You'd be using other apps

216
0:7:22,39 --> 0:7:24,37
You wouldn't have this setup

217
0:7:24,37 --> 0:7:26,5
It wasn't like that at birth.

218
0:7:26,5 --> 0:7:28,78
You weren't someone with basic scientific literacy either.

219
0:7:28,78 --> 0:7:29,8
What I mean is,

220
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:32,18
Bilibili will always be for the top 6.5% of Chinese people.

221
0:7:32,18 --> 0:7:34,1
That part of the young generation,

222
0:7:34,1 --> 0:7:37,29
Most real fire-ghost teenagers and girls,

223
0:7:37,29 --> 0:7:38,85
They generally don't visit Bilibili.

224
0:7:38,85 --> 0:7:40,45
Or they might visit when they were much younger,

225
0:7:40,45 --> 0:7:42,68
But they won't watch it when they are in their twenties or thirties.

226
0:7:42,68 --> 0:7:44,96
And what are you really here for on Bilibili?

227
0:7:44,96 --> 0:7:47,4
You're here to gain knowledge from different social strata.

228
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:48,54
This is the most critical part for you.

229
0:7:48,54 --> 0:7:52,27
So, we always say that we can never completely avoid it,

230
0:7:52,27 --> 0:7:54,11
the unfair phenomena in society.

231
0:7:54,11 --> 0:7:56,14
Many of these are historical legacies,

232
0:7:56,14 --> 0:7:57,98
and some are the harsh realities of today.

233
0:7:57,98 --> 0:7:58,94
But no matter what,

234
0:7:58,94 --> 0:8:0,58
you just need to figure out one thing.

235
0:8:0,58 --> 0:8:2,11
First, as a person

236
0:8:2,11 --> 0:8:3,41
how do you survive?

237
0:8:3,41 --> 0:8:7,25
Second, simply put, how do I change my surroundings?

238
0:8:7,25 --> 0:8:9,5
using whatever small resources I have

239
0:8:9,5 --> 0:8:12,56
So, have I figured out this question?

240
0:8:12,56 --> 0:8:13,46
When I was young

241
0:8:13,46 --> 0:8:15,22
I also pursued fairness and justice passionately

242
0:8:15,22 --> 0:8:16,7
But I found that those ideals

243
0:8:16,7 --> 0:8:18,33
those outbursts

244
0:8:18,33 --> 0:8:21,23
All those complaints and grievances

245
0:8:21,23 --> 0:8:22,89
In the end

246
0:8:22,89 --> 0:8:24,9
we all face one issue

247
0:8:24,9 --> 0:8:25,33
our own survival

248
0:8:25,33 --> 0:8:26,61
the question of existence and extinction

249
0:8:26,61 --> 0:8:29,0
If I can't even solve my own survival

250
0:8:29,0 --> 0:8:30,76
what's the point of practicing swordsmanship every day

251
0:8:30,76 --> 0:8:31,56
and making a big fuss

252
0:8:31,56 --> 0:8:32,4
What's the use of it all?

253
0:8:32,4 --> 0:8:33,62
So, talking about it,

254
0:8:33,62 --> 0:8:37,36
I've noticed that the more you hate someone,

255
0:8:37,36 --> 0:8:39,2
the more you need to work for them.

256
0:8:39,2 --> 0:8:41,12
Do you think I would work for those rich second generations?

257
0:8:41,12 --> 0:8:41,83
Right?

258
0:8:41,83 --> 0:8:43,47
In exchange, I gained my initial capital.

259
0:8:43,47 --> 0:8:46,99
This initial capital made my survival much easier.

260
0:8:46,99 --> 0:8:48,7
So that's how it is.

261
0:8:48,7 --> 0:8:50,27
Many things go against common sense.

262
0:8:50,27 --> 0:8:54,929
You want to fight for the interests of the hardworking common people

263
0:8:54,929 --> 0:8:55,849
That's the right thing to do

264
0:8:55,849 --> 0:8:57,369
It shows that you have a kind heart

265
0:8:57,369 --> 0:8:58,669
You are a normal person

266
0:8:58,669 --> 0:8:59,969
You are someone with compassion

267
0:8:59,969 --> 0:9:1,9
A person with empathy

268
0:9:1,9 --> 0:9:2,2
Someone who has a merciful heart

269
0:9:2,2 --> 0:9:5,8
But when you serve these people

270
0:9:5,8 --> 0:9:7,56
You also need to understand them

271
0:9:7,56 --> 0:9:8,64
What you do for them

272
0:9:8,64 --> 0:9:10,589
they don't have the means to pay you back

273
0:9:10,589 --> 0:9:12,229
and that's the most frustrating part

274
0:9:12,229 --> 0:9:14,469
you'll find that those who seem to take advantage

275
0:9:14,469 --> 0:9:16,29
like the wealthy

276
0:9:16,29 --> 0:9:19,1
they will find ways to return the favor

277
0:9:19,1 --> 0:9:21,1
that's the counterintuitive part

278
0:9:21,1 --> 0:9:22,53
when you help the poor

279
0:9:22,53 --> 0:9:25,43
the poor can actually solve fewer problems for you

280
0:9:25,43 --> 0:9:28,2
Because his own survival energy is relatively low

281
0:9:28,2 --> 0:9:29,96
But when you help the rich solve problems

282
0:9:29,96 --> 0:9:33,4
You act as the rich's lackey to address some of their

283
0:9:33,4 --> 0:9:34,8
actual issues

284
0:9:34,8 --> 0:9:36,26
The rewards you receive will always be substantial

285
0:9:36,26 --> 0:9:37,54
So let me tell you

286
0:9:37,54 --> 0:9:38,82
The right path in life

287
0:9:38,82 --> 0:9:40,36
Is to work for the rich

288
0:9:40,36 --> 0:9:42,75
To solve their pressing concerns

289
0:9:42,75 --> 0:9:44,27
You need to be their lackey

290
0:9:44,27 --> 0:9:48,8
and then use the money they earn to help the poor

291
0:9:48,8 --> 0:9:50,36
Of course, by the time you're 30

292
0:9:50,36 --> 0:9:51,12
or 40

293
0:9:51,12 --> 0:9:51,76
or even 50

294
0:9:51,76 --> 0:9:52,87
you might not think that way anymore

295
0:9:52,87 --> 0:9:54,67
by then, you might have your own kids

296
0:9:54,67 --> 0:9:56,31
or you might have established your own business

297
0:9:56,31 --> 0:9:59,23
or you might have become part of a certain group

298
0:9:59,23 --> 0:10:0,65
You might not think that way.

299
0:10:0,65 --> 0:10:2,39
So the world is changing.

300
0:10:2,39 --> 0:10:3,87
So when you're young,

301
0:10:3,87 --> 0:10:5,3
What's known as a pure heart,

302
0:10:5,3 --> 0:10:6,87
You have some roots of kindness at this time.

303
0:10:6,87 --> 0:10:8,45
You must protect them well.

304
0:10:8,45 --> 0:10:9,81
Keep them hidden.

305
0:10:9,81 --> 0:10:11,29
Don't easily exploit them.

306
0:10:11,29 --> 0:10:12,65
So in many cases,

307
0:10:12,65 --> 0:10:14,99
When we talk about it, these things are not easy.

308
0:10:14,99 --> 0:10:18,98
So you'll find that Brother Rong is also a hypocritical person.

309
0:10:18,98 --> 0:10:21,92
Although I might say that I sympathize with the underprivileged.

310
0:10:21,92 --> 0:10:25,77
I would never hand over the trash in my hands to them.

311
0:10:25,77 --> 0:10:26,45
That's just it.

312
0:10:26,45 --> 0:10:28,15
I'm afraid they might turn around and bite me.

313
0:10:28,15 --> 0:10:28,85
It's that simple.

314
0:10:28,85 --> 0:10:31,15
This is the survival dilemma of the intelligentsia.

315
0:10:31,15 --> 0:10:34,24
He has a compassionate personality.

316
0:10:34,24 --> 0:10:35,54
It's hard to say,

317
0:10:35,54 --> 0:10:36,62
a universal value,

318
0:10:36,62 --> 0:10:39,46
a value of standing up for the hardworking masses,

319
0:10:39,46 --> 0:10:42,3
but once his social status,

320
0:10:42,3 --> 0:10:43,78
rises to the wealthy class,

321
0:10:43,78 --> 0:10:45,76
or the elite class,

322
0:10:45,76 --> 0:10:47,91
his considerations change,

323
0:10:47,91 --> 0:10:50,89
firstly, to ensure his class status doesn’t slip,

324
0:10:50,89 --> 0:10:52,51
to secure his living condition,

325
0:10:52,51 --> 0:10:55,64
and that his family members remain in this system,

326
0:10:55,64 --> 0:10:57,56
the issues you consider,

327
0:10:57,56 --> 0:10:59,16
like what Brother Rong is considering now,

328
0:10:59,16 --> 0:11:2,68
is whether I should start a Pangdonglai supermarket,

329
0:11:2,68 --> 0:11:5,97
not whether I should return to the U.S.

330
0:11:5,97 --> 0:11:6,57
or Canada,

331
0:11:6,57 --> 0:11:7,67
right?

332
0:11:7,67 --> 0:11:9,9
This is my top priority,

333
0:11:9,9 --> 0:11:10,41
as I always say,

334
0:11:10,41 --> 0:11:12,7
making money from the rich is relatively easier,

335
0:11:12,7 --> 0:11:14,7
especially when it comes to making money from wealthy Chinese,

336
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:18,72
it’s much easier compared to making money from ordinary people,

337
0:11:18,72 --> 0:11:21,48
so this is a simpler path in life,

338
0:11:21,48 --> 0:11:23,98
which means you are still serving the rich,

339
0:11:23,98 --> 0:11:25,65
the world has no such responsibility,

340
0:11:25,65 --> 0:11:27,65
no simple and straightforward truth,

341
0:11:27,65 --> 0:11:29,13
that can be universally applied,

342
0:11:29,13 --> 0:11:30,78
so that’s how reality works,

343
0:11:30,78 --> 0:11:34,5
I’ve tasted the sweetness from this way of working,

344
0:11:34,5 --> 0:11:36,37
so I will continue with this model,

345
0:11:36,37 --> 0:11:37,45
for me,

346
0:11:37,45 --> 0:11:39,35
I just want to live a good life,

347
0:11:39,35 --> 0:11:42,17
I just want to live a simpler life,

348
0:11:42,17 --> 0:11:45,2
in a place that’s not so competitive,

349
0:11:45,2 --> 0:11:47,62
but still, the original question remains,

350
0:11:47,62 --> 0:11:50,92
are we beekeepers or honey?

351
0:11:50,92 --> 0:11:52,2
or bees?

352
0:11:52,2 --> 0:11:53,62
you must understand this principle,

353
0:11:53,62 --> 0:11:54,64
of course,

354
0:11:54,64 --> 0:11:57,36
I think the best thing is to be a beekeeper,

355
0:11:57,36 --> 0:11:59,7
being a beekeeper always has better luck,

356
0:11:59,7 --> 0:12:0,58
luck,

357
0:12:0,58 --> 0:12:2,98
than a bee’s luck,

358
0:12:2,98 --> 0:12:6,42
this is the reality of the capital game.
