1
0:0:0,34 --> 0:0:1,66
Hey everyone

2
0:0:1,66 --> 0:0:2,96
a new episode of Bed Chat

3
0:0:2,96 --> 0:0:5,1
Oh, look at my face, it’s so big

4
0:0:5,1 --> 0:0:7,75
it keeps changing, getting smaller and bigger

5
0:0:7,75 --> 0:0:9,33
it’s actually the focal length issue

6
0:0:9,33 --> 0:0:11,59
a lot of people say that in person

7
0:0:11,59 --> 0:0:12,87
it’s not really like that

8
0:0:12,87 --> 0:0:15,27
but I’m actually quite heavy now

9
0:0:15,27 --> 0:0:17,71
I’m 88 kg now

10
0:0:17,71 --> 0:0:19,75
That's 176 pounds.

11
0:0:19,75 --> 0:0:24,86
You see, when I was in my twenties and thirties, I only weighed between 108 to 120 pounds.

12
0:0:24,86 --> 0:0:28,7
So, this is currently my peak weight period.

13
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:32,669
Some people say it's related to the drinks I consume.

14
0:0:33,66 --> 0:0:35,18
But I really am not hungry.

15
0:0:35,18 --> 0:0:36,58
Look, I've been hungry all day today.

16
0:0:36,58 --> 0:0:37,26
It's not a big deal.

17
0:0:37,26 --> 0:0:38,82
In this episode, let's dive into our content.

18
0:0:38,82 --> 0:0:40,9
In the previous episode, we discussed why we should go to Northeast China.

19
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:43,58
Why Northeast China is a great choice

20
0:0:43,58 --> 0:0:46,2
What I'm planning to talk about in my next four episodes

21
0:0:46,2 --> 0:0:47,1
Why you should visit Northeast China

22
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:48,6
Why you should go to Chengdu

23
0:0:48,6 --> 0:0:48,98
Why you should visit Hangzhou

24
0:0:48,98 --> 0:0:50,41
Why you should go to Foshan

25
0:0:50,41 --> 0:0:51,65
Why you should visit Xinjiang

26
0:0:51,65 --> 0:0:53,25
I'll be doing five consecutive episodes

27
0:0:53,25 --> 0:0:55,59
All about the beautiful landscapes of our country

28
0:0:55,59 --> 0:0:59,87
Often, the reason people feel depressed

29
0:0:59,87 --> 0:1:2,23
is due to a lack of choices.

30
0:1:2,23 --> 0:1:4,57
For instance, I decided to pursue a direct Ph.D.

31
0:1:4,57 --> 0:1:7,41
However, my mentor wasn't very nice to me.

32
0:1:7,41 --> 0:1:8,169
He bullies me.

33
0:1:8,169 --> 0:1:9,409
I got married.

34
0:1:9,409 --> 0:1:10,129
My husband

35
0:1:10,129 --> 0:1:11,429
My wife abuses me

36
0:1:11,429 --> 0:1:13,1
As a result, I'm not doing well.

37
0:1:13,1 --> 0:1:14,34
I'm in Shanghai.

38
0:1:14,34 --> 0:1:16,22
I can't make it back to my hometown.

39
0:1:16,22 --> 0:1:16,96
I'm in Beijing.

40
0:1:16,96 --> 0:1:19,25
I can't make it back to my hometown or I am in my hometown.

41
0:1:19,25 --> 0:1:21,9
There aren't many opportunities back home.

42
0:1:21,9 --> 0:1:22,1
So, how should I put it?

43
0:1:22,1 --> 0:1:23,59
Life shouldn't be a narrow bridge.

44
0:1:23,59 --> 0:1:25,31
Life should be an open field.

45
0:1:25,31 --> 0:1:27,11
There are many times

46
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:31,12
We think we know our country

47
0:1:31,12 --> 0:1:35,4
but in reality, one can't be in Beijing

48
0:1:35,4 --> 0:1:35,8
in 2025

49
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:36,5
and in Hangzhou at the same time

50
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:38,82
Look, I've made five trips back and forth

51
0:1:38,82 --> 0:1:40,1
You can't remember everything about Beijing

52
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:40,9
and Hangzhou simultaneously

53
0:1:40,9 --> 0:1:44,88
So you can't enjoy the benefits of both cities at the same time

54
0:1:44,88 --> 0:1:48,33
But the benefits of each city are entirely different

55
0:1:48,33 --> 0:1:52,55
There was a trending topic this year or last year

56
0:1:52,55 --> 0:1:58,2
about the second-tier university admission score line for Heilongjiang being 212 points

57
0:1:58,2 --> 0:1:59,419
many people commented

58
0:1:59,419 --> 0:2:1,559
how could the scores in Northeast China be so low

59
0:2:1,559 --> 0:2:6,259
because the number of students in the three Northeast provinces is roughly 100,000

60
0:2:6,259 --> 0:2:8,86
with about 100,000 candidates each year

61
0:2:8,86 --> 0:2:13,82
which is a million fewer than in major college entrance exam provinces like Henan over the past two years

62
0:2:13,82 --> 0:2:15,34
you have to understand that

63
0:2:15,34 --> 0:2:18,62
competing with 11 people is different from competing with just yourself

64
0:2:18,62 --> 0:2:20,38
That's a completely different feeling

65
0:2:20,38 --> 0:2:21,56
So, when we talk about it

66
0:2:23,69 --> 0:2:25,57
When the population decreases

67
0:2:25,57 --> 0:2:27,35
It naturally follows a trend

68
0:2:27,35 --> 0:2:29,35
Schools become less challenging to get into

69
0:2:29,35 --> 0:2:31,24
Jobs become easier to find

70
0:2:31,24 --> 0:2:37,22
So I often say that China is now on the path to becoming a moderately developed country

71
0:2:37,22 --> 0:2:39,87
I believe we are already a developed country

72
0:2:39,87 --> 0:2:41,67
But some people believe we are still on the journey.

73
0:2:41,67 --> 0:2:44,91
Some people think there's no need to emphasize our status as a developing country.

74
0:2:44,91 --> 0:2:50,27
This is because GDP is categorized using PPP.

75
0:2:50,27 --> 0:2:51,9
It's another matter altogether.

76
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:53,11
So, no matter how you look at it,

77
0:2:53,11 --> 0:2:54,93
I believe, regardless of anything else,

78
0:2:54,93 --> 0:2:57,5
we are now a middle-income developed country.

79
0:2:57,5 --> 0:2:57,85
That's my take on it.

80
0:2:57,85 --> 0:3:2,85
But even developed countries have their own set of issues.

81
0:3:2,85 --> 0:3:5,75
But what choices do we have?

82
0:3:5,75 --> 0:3:7,23
Many people

83
0:3:7,23 --> 0:3:10,79
I don’t recommend that you start thinking about settling down in your twenties

84
0:3:10,79 --> 0:3:12,86
about where to settle down

85
0:3:12,86 --> 0:3:14,1
the issue of settling down

86
0:3:14,1 --> 0:3:15,8
should be addressed in your thirties or forties

87
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:22,38
but the biggest issue with settling down is where your in-laws and family are located

88
0:3:22,38 --> 0:3:24,72
many Chinese elders are deeply attached to their hometowns

89
0:3:24,72 --> 0:3:26,74
they hope you buy a house in Beijing

90
0:3:26,74 --> 0:3:28,7
and also hope you buy a house in the county town

91
0:3:28,7 --> 0:3:30,26
It would be best to buy another house back in your hometown.

92
0:3:30,26 --> 0:3:32,7
It would be best for him to buy another house back in his hometown.

93
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:34,16
This whole thing is just so frustrating.

94
0:3:34,16 --> 0:3:37,48
What good would a house in the county town do?

95
0:3:37,48 --> 0:3:38,1
Let me tell you,

96
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:39,12
buying a house in Beijing,

97
0:3:39,12 --> 0:3:40,64
you might end up being a mortgage slave.

98
0:3:40,64 --> 0:3:43,11
So, what kind of choice should be made?

99
0:3:43,11 --> 0:3:46,69
First, look at China’s top 20 cities for earning potential.

100
0:3:46,69 --> 0:3:51,15
Are there any cities where the housing prices are relatively cheaper?

101
0:3:51,15 --> 0:3:52,37
And the competition is not as intense?

102
0:3:52,37 --> 0:3:53,5
Yes, there are.

103
0:3:53,5 --> 0:3:53,95
Changsha, for example.

104
0:3:53,95 --> 0:3:54,65
Suzhou as well.

105
0:3:54,65 --> 0:3:55,66
Right?

106
0:3:55,66 --> 0:4:0,39
I mentioned Chengdu because Brother Rong is currently there, you see.

107
0:4:0,39 --> 0:4:2,17
Does Straight Man Wei Shuang like effeminate men?

108
0:4:2,17 --> 0:4:3,13
Not really.

109
0:4:3,13 --> 0:4:3,65
Why

110
0:4:3,65 --> 0:4:6,23
Because Chengdu has attracted a large number of beauties from Tibet

111
0:4:6,23 --> 0:4:6,69
Xinjiang

112
0:4:6,69 --> 0:4:9,81
and throughout Sichuan Province

113
0:4:9,81 --> 0:4:17,569
So the number of small and medium-sized enterprises in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, ranks very high nationwide

114
0:4:17,569 --> 0:4:18,369
Probably first, I think

115
0:4:18,369 --> 0:4:19,6
I can't remember for sure though

116
0:4:19,6 --> 0:4:21,72
But we need to back up our claims with solid data

117
0:4:21,72 --> 0:4:23,68
After all, this is a talk show program.

118
0:4:23,68 --> 0:4:25,58
We might not be as rigorous

119
0:4:25,58 --> 0:4:29,7
But in this episode, we're talking about 212 points in Northeast China

120
0:4:29,7 --> 0:4:34,93
What does 212 points mean?

121
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:38,23
Is Qiqihar University going to welcome you with drums and gongs?

122
0:4:38,23 --> 0:4:39,53
And fireworks?

123
0:4:39,53 --> 0:4:41,23
As Comrade Zhang Xuefeng said

124
0:4:41,23 --> 0:4:43,2
Zhang Haifeng is particularly something

125
0:4:43,2 --> 0:4:43,96
So when it comes to it

126
0:4:43,96 --> 0:4:47,16
You're just like my kid, it's awesome!

127
0:4:47,16 --> 0:4:48,96
His mother is from Heilongjiang.

128
0:4:48,96 --> 0:4:50,64
His father is from Beijing.

129
0:4:50,64 --> 0:4:52,87
Which one will he choose?

130
0:4:52,87 --> 0:4:54,87
Or perhaps the educational resources are particularly good.

131
0:4:54,87 --> 0:4:55,45
The scores aren't that high.

132
0:4:55,45 --> 0:4:57,1
Or maybe the natural resources aren't that great.

133
0:4:57,1 --> 0:4:59,87
But these two provinces really don't have high scores.

134
0:4:59,87 --> 0:5:1,45
Of course, Beijing is a municipality outside of the provinces.

135
0:5:1,45 --> 0:5:2,85
So let's be precise.

136
0:5:2,85 --> 0:5:6,19
Departing from Beijing Chaoyang Station today

137
0:5:6,19 --> 0:5:8,99
it takes about eight hours to reach Jiamusi

138
0:5:8,99 --> 0:5:11,29
Departing from Beijing Chaoyang Station today

139
0:5:11,29 --> 0:5:12,11
five hours

140
0:5:12,11 --> 0:5:12,83
four hours

141
0:5:12,83 --> 0:5:13,95
54 minutes or four hours

142
0:5:13,95 --> 0:5:16,1
51 minutes to get to Harbin

143
0:5:16,1 --> 0:5:17,42
It's incredibly fast

144
0:5:17,42 --> 0:5:18,6
I noticed it has been sped up

145
0:5:18,6 --> 0:5:19,94
How many stations are there in Beijing?

146
0:5:19,94 --> 0:5:20,66
Chaoyang Station

147
0:5:20,66 --> 0:5:21,97
Fengtai Station

148
0:5:21,97 --> 0:5:23,19
Nan Station and Xi Station

149
0:5:23,19 --> 0:5:23,79
Bei Station

150
0:5:23,79 --> 0:5:24,99
I'm near Bei Station

151
0:5:24,99 --> 0:5:26,29
Bei Station goes to Zhangjiakou

152
0:5:26,29 --> 0:5:27,38
and to Inner Mongolia

153
0:5:27,38 --> 0:5:29,38
Chaoyang Station is specifically for Northeast China

154
0:5:29,38 --> 0:5:30,1
Nanjing Station

155
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:33,94
Xizhan, or the Western Station, handles the majority of westbound trains.

156
0:5:33,94 --> 0:5:36,18
But the busiest one is Beijing South Station.

157
0:5:36,18 --> 0:5:37,72
Of course, for nearby areas,

158
0:5:37,72 --> 0:5:38,62
local trains,

159
0:5:38,62 --> 0:5:39,9
like those heading to Hebei,

160
0:5:39,9 --> 0:5:41,1
Henan, and Shandong provinces,

161
0:5:41,1 --> 0:5:45,3
Fengtai Station also sees a lot of traffic, especially for those in the railway system.

162
0:5:45,3 --> 0:5:46,7
If you’re willing to correct me, please go ahead.

163
0:5:46,7 --> 0:5:47,14
Correct me if I'm wrong

164
0:5:47,14 --> 0:5:48,8
Because I'm not quite familiar with it

165
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:49,44
This thing

166
0:5:49,44 --> 0:5:53,8
But Brother Rong is someone who enjoys the thrill of spending

167
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:56,19
He always opts for the business class whenever he travels

168
0:5:56,19 --> 0:5:56,95
Why is that?

169
0:5:56,95 --> 0:5:58,23
Because after a high-speed train ride

170
0:5:58,23 --> 0:5:59,45
There are costs involved

171
0:5:59,45 --> 0:6:2,19
We can't keep letting him operate at a loss

172
0:6:2,19 --> 0:6:3,31
We need to make it profitable.

173
0:6:3,31 --> 0:6:7,2
So when conditions allow, go for the first-class seat.

174
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:9,6
And if you can, opt for the business class.

175
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:10,66
Especially for short trips.

176
0:6:10,66 --> 0:6:11,82
Let’s go for the business class.

177
0:6:11,82 --> 0:6:13,26
People might say it’s a waste or something.

178
0:6:13,26 --> 0:6:14,42
But the experience is different.

179
0:6:14,42 --> 0:6:16,24
The most important thing in life is the experience.

180
0:6:16,24 --> 0:6:18,15
We save money in other areas.

181
0:6:18,15 --> 0:6:20,63
We don't have to be frugal all the time and in every place.

182
0:6:20,63 --> 0:6:21,3
Right?

183
0:6:21,3 --> 0:6:23,15
So, we should spend where it counts, spend a bit more.

184
0:6:23,15 --> 0:6:24,35
It's good for economic growth, after all.

185
0:6:24,35 --> 0:6:25,91
Right, spending a bit more helps young people earn money.

186
0:6:25,91 --> 0:6:26,53
Isn't it?

187
0:6:26,53 --> 0:6:26,69
You,

188
0:6:26,69 --> 0:6:27,81
don't be a bunch of old tightwads,

189
0:6:27,81 --> 0:6:28,57
spending not a single penny.

190
0:6:28,57 --> 0:6:29,9
Which line?

191
0:6:29,9 --> 0:6:29,37
Right or wrong?

192
0:6:29,37 --> 0:6:31,27
So Brother Rong has arrived at Zhongdeng.

193
0:6:31,27 --> 0:6:35,465
Is Zhongdeng what we're talking about?

194
0:6:36,46 --> 0:6:41,15
Ah, Zhang Bin is the one from Zhongdeng, Zang Bin.

195
0:6:41,15 --> 0:6:42,15
About Zhongdeng,

196
0:6:42,15 --> 0:6:43,3
Brother Rong is also from Zhongdeng.

197
0:6:43,3 --> 0:6:45,41
But Brother Rong is a couple of years younger than him.

198
0:6:45,41 --> 0:6:48,95
I'm not even as tall as that guy's foot yet.

199
0:6:48,95 --> 0:6:53,12
So, the reason we chose Northeast China is

200
0:6:53,12 --> 0:6:56,9
because Northeast China is often referred to as the eldest son of the People's Republic of China.

201
0:6:56,9 --> 0:7:0,64
It’s a testing ground for social models.

202
0:7:0,64 --> 0:7:2,72
As the saying goes, oranges grown south of the Huai River are oranges,

203
0:7:2,72 --> 0:7:4,21
but those grown north of the Huai River are citrons.

204
0:7:4,21 --> 0:7:6,25
Most people in today's Northeast China,

205
0:7:6,25 --> 0:7:7,49
were originally from Shandong Province,

206
0:7:7,49 --> 0:7:8,6
or Hebei Province,

207
0:7:8,6 --> 0:7:10,6
but why do they become Northeasterners once they get to the Northeast?

208
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:12,62
That's because the natural environment is different.

209
0:7:12,62 --> 0:7:14,82
And Northeast China is a truly magical land.

210
0:7:14,82 --> 0:7:18,92
Most of its cities are industrial cities.

211
0:7:22,84 --> 0:7:25,0
When we talk about people from Western Liaoning, of course.

212
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:27,589
Farmers in Eastern Liaoning are different from those in Heilongjiang and Jilin.

213
0:7:27,589 --> 0:7:30,2
We haven't conducted a detailed survey.

214
0:7:30,2 --> 0:7:31,9
We're just talking about what we've observed.

215
0:7:31,9 --> 0:7:33,3
Large-scale farms,

216
0:7:33,3 --> 0:7:34,54
agricultural mechanization, right?

217
0:7:34,54 --> 0:7:36,71
Large agricultural machinery

218
0:7:36,71 --> 0:7:40,7
and gender equality in the industrial age

219
0:7:40,7 --> 0:7:42,28
As we often say, Northeastern only daughters

220
0:7:43,26 --> 0:7:45,2
When comparing with the four provinces of Shanhe

221
0:7:45,2 --> 0:7:47,1
it’s a completely different concept

222
0:7:47,1 --> 0:7:48,159
So, to put it this way

223
0:7:48,159 --> 0:7:50,799
We have very conservative regions in China

224
0:7:50,799 --> 0:7:51,879
We won’t specify which ones

225
0:7:51,879 --> 0:7:53,679
Of course, everyone feels differently about what is conservative

226
0:7:53,679 --> 0:7:54,959
Some say Shandong is conservative

227
0:7:54,959 --> 0:7:56,2
Some say Northwest China is conservative

228
0:7:56,2 --> 0:7:57,84
But that's not the case

229
0:7:57,84 --> 0:8:0,42
When it comes to the most pioneering places in China

230
0:8:0,42 --> 0:8:2,47
Speaking of the most forward-thinking areas

231
0:8:2,47 --> 0:8:4,11
In terms of social structure

232
0:8:4,11 --> 0:8:5,19
Let's not talk about economic development

233
0:8:5,19 --> 0:8:6,83
When it comes to social structure

234
0:8:6,83 --> 0:8:10,3
Considering the population ratio and people's mindset

235
0:8:10,3 --> 0:8:11,82
Northeast China is absolutely top-notch

236
0:8:11,82 --> 0:8:13,36
When it comes to Northeasterners

237
0:8:13,36 --> 0:8:14,86
They can be found all over the world

238
0:8:14,86 --> 0:8:16,82
Because they have a pioneering and enterprising spirit

239
0:8:16,82 --> 0:8:17,86
This is truly remarkable

240
0:8:17,86 --> 0:8:21,18
And all of this wisdom is encapsulated in four-character phrases

241
0:8:21,18 --> 0:8:22,96
So what can they do?

242
0:8:22,96 --> 0:8:25,53
When things hit rock bottom

243
0:8:25,53 --> 0:8:27,1
What else can I do, right?

244
0:8:27,1 --> 0:8:27,97
What can I do about it?

245
0:8:27,97 --> 0:8:29,57
So, in many cases,

246
0:8:29,57 --> 0:8:30,81
Let's talk about the philosophy of survival.

247
0:8:30,81 --> 0:8:32,75
We need to learn from the people in Northeast China.

248
0:8:33,39 --> 0:8:36,33
First, no difficulty can crush me.

249
0:8:36,33 --> 0:8:37,33
Second,

250
0:8:37,33 --> 0:8:38,59
There's always a way out of any situation.

251
0:8:38,59 --> 0:8:39,61
What else can we do?

252
0:8:39,61 --> 0:8:40,87
Right?

253
0:8:41,54 --> 0:8:44,87
So this is the harsh environment

254
0:8:44,87 --> 0:8:46,59
that has forged resilient people

255
0:8:46,59 --> 0:8:47,55
That makes all the difference

256
0:8:47,55 --> 0:8:48,33
So, when we talk about it

257
0:8:48,33 --> 0:8:51,34
When we say, of course, we're talking about moving to Northeast China

258
0:8:51,34 --> 0:8:54,8
I explained why I chose to talk about Northeast China first

259
0:8:54,8 --> 0:8:55,1
First of all

260
0:8:55,1 --> 0:8:59,89
The most significant feature of Northeast China is the relatively low prices of agricultural and food products

261
0:9:0,89 --> 0:9:2,11
In Shenyang

262
0:9:2,11 --> 0:9:3,5
Except for Dalian, though.

263
0:9:3,5 --> 0:9:3,97
Dalian is Dalian, China.

264
0:9:3,97 --> 0:9:4,89
You're in Shenyang.

265
0:9:4,89 --> 0:9:5,61
In western Liaoning.

266
0:9:5,61 --> 0:9:6,17
Eastern Liaoning, yeah.

267
0:9:6,17 --> 0:9:8,1
Among all the cities in Liaoning Province.

268
0:9:8,1 --> 0:9:9,25
I've been to more places across the country than anyone else.

269
0:9:9,25 --> 0:9:11,55
Basically, all the medium and small cities in Liaoning Province.

270
0:9:11,55 --> 0:9:14,6
From these big cities to Jilin.

271
0:9:14,6 --> 0:9:15,12
When talking about Heilongjiang,

272
0:9:15,12 --> 0:9:16,48
You say you're not eating well,

273
0:9:16,48 --> 0:9:17,88
Saying you might starve to death,

274
0:9:17,88 --> 0:9:19,3
But in modern society, that's highly unlikely.

275
0:9:19,3 --> 0:9:21,9
So, when we talk about eating, clothing, housing, and transportation,

276
0:9:21,9 --> 0:9:25,63
Let's talk about housing and transportation.

277
0:9:25,63 --> 0:9:27,53
When it comes to these things,

278
0:9:27,53 --> 0:9:29,2
There's absolutely no problem in Northeast China.

279
0:9:29,2 --> 0:9:30,32
First, let's talk about housing.

280
0:9:30,32 --> 0:9:32,36
It's not just a Hegang issue

281
0:9:32,36 --> 0:9:34,0
You see, many places like Fuxi

282
0:9:34,0 --> 0:9:35,43
When you look at many places

283
0:9:35,43 --> 0:9:37,49
Of course, I don’t recommend holding onto it

284
0:9:37,49 --> 0:9:39,63
From the perspective of property ownership

285
0:9:39,63 --> 0:9:40,63
You should still hold onto it

286
0:9:40,63 --> 0:9:41,59
Real estate in first-tier cities

287
0:9:41,59 --> 0:9:44,339
But from the perspective of renting

288
0:9:44,339 --> 0:9:46,299
Is renting a house very expensive?

289
0:9:46,299 --> 0:9:49,1
For younger people, you can stay on the fifth or sixth floor.

290
0:9:49,1 --> 0:9:49,98
For someone like me, in the middle age,

291
0:9:49,98 --> 0:9:50,96
I stay on the third or fourth floor.

292
0:9:50,96 --> 0:9:52,14
When you get older, you can live on the first or second floor.

293
0:9:52,14 --> 0:9:53,62
So, in many places, the real estate is like this,

294
0:9:53,62 --> 0:9:55,369
first of all, it’s not expensive in terms of this aspect,

295
0:9:55,369 --> 0:9:56,549
the food is also affordable,

296
0:9:56,549 --> 0:9:57,389
and the housing is also inexpensive.

297
0:9:57,389 --> 0:9:58,69
Sounds good.

298
0:9:58,69 --> 0:10:0,129
Do we need a lottery system like in Beijing?

299
0:10:0,129 --> 0:10:2,44
Are you riding correctly?

300
0:10:2,44 --> 0:10:4,8
Do we need a lottery system like in Beijing?

301
0:10:4,8 --> 0:10:5,36
You're riding a motorcycle, right?

302
0:10:5,36 --> 0:10:6,76
Of course, speaking of Northeast China,

303
0:10:6,76 --> 0:10:8,38
I don't recommend you get an electric car.

304
0:10:8,38 --> 0:10:10,1
When it comes to riding a motorcycle,

305
0:10:10,1 --> 0:10:11,6
At least it won't freeze up.

306
0:10:11,6 --> 0:10:11,74
Speaking of electric cars,

307
0:10:11,74 --> 0:10:13,1
The performance degradation is quite significant.

308
0:10:13,1 --> 0:10:14,66
But there's no issue with gasoline cars either.

309
0:10:14,66 --> 0:10:18,22
So a lot of the time, for clothing, food, and accommodation, you buy local clothes and eat local food.

310
0:10:18,22 --> 0:10:19,4
You just eat locally.

311
0:10:19,4 --> 0:10:20,26
And for transportation, you figure something out.

312
0:10:20,26 --> 0:10:23,76
So a lot of the time, we need to consider that the cost of living isn't that high.

313
0:10:23,76 --> 0:10:25,5
You don't have to work so hard.

314
0:10:25,5 --> 0:10:27,12
Many people will tell you,

315
0:10:27,12 --> 0:10:28,79
Especially some of the old hands.

316
0:10:28,79 --> 0:10:29,95
Let me tell you,

317
0:10:29,95 --> 0:10:31,99
you've got to live in a city with high housing prices,

318
0:10:31,99 --> 0:10:34,19
those cities are where the cultural atmosphere is,

319
0:10:34,19 --> 0:10:37,89
but do I really need all those cultural activities?

320
0:10:37,89 --> 0:10:39,11
I just want to live my life,

321
0:10:39,11 --> 0:10:41,13
And my life now is quite simple.

322
0:10:41,13 --> 0:10:43,88
just playing some War and Delta Force,

323
0:10:43,88 --> 0:10:45,8
trying out some murder mystery games,

324
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:47,93
and maybe checking out some comic conventions, that's it.

325
0:10:47,93 --> 0:10:49,5
My life is over.

326
0:10:49,5 --> 0:10:51,11
I mostly spend my time making videos.

327
0:10:51,11 --> 0:10:52,21
Watch others' videos

328
0:10:52,21 --> 0:10:53,21
playing on the PS5

329
0:10:53,21 --> 0:10:53,93
playing on the Xbox

330
0:10:53,93 --> 0:10:54,53
playing on the Switch

331
0:10:54,53 --> 0:10:56,0
and playing on the Steam Deck, that’s it.

332
0:10:56,0 --> 0:10:57,4
My life doesn’t have much significance

333
0:10:57,4 --> 0:10:58,3
and the most I do is take care of the kids

334
0:10:58,3 --> 0:10:59,59
Spend some time with the kids on weekends

335
0:10:59,59 --> 0:11:1,31
Maybe go for a stroll somewhere

336
0:11:1,31 --> 0:11:3,31
Then hop on my little electric scooter and go out to play

337
0:11:3,31 --> 0:11:6,52
I’m actually already living a retired life, in a sense

338
0:11:6,52 --> 0:11:8,68
So what should retired life be like

339
0:11:8,68 --> 0:11:11,5
First, convenient healthcare

340
0:11:11,5 --> 0:11:12,17
But when it comes to healthcare

341
0:11:12,17 --> 0:11:14,15
In Northeast China, healthcare shouldn’t be a problem

342
0:11:14,15 --> 0:11:14,97
In my opinion

343
0:11:15,93 --> 0:11:16,93
all you need to do is register for an appointment

344
0:11:16,93 --> 0:11:18,54
So, to put it simply

345
0:11:18,54 --> 0:11:20,9
accommodation, travel, and medical care can all be taken care of

346
0:11:20,9 --> 0:11:21,82
And most importantly

347
0:11:21,82 --> 0:11:22,9
If I am, let's say

348
0:11:22,9 --> 0:11:23,86
I am 40 years old now

349
0:11:23,86 --> 0:11:25,2
I mentioned 20 years old

350
0:11:25,2 --> 0:11:25,46
30 years old

351
0:11:25,46 --> 0:11:26,98
At 40, the differences are significant.

352
0:11:26,98 --> 0:11:29,98
At 20, you should be striving in a big city.

353
0:11:29,98 --> 0:11:32,82
By 30, you face the prospect of marriage and starting a family.

354
0:11:32,82 --> 0:11:34,22
Then, you might move to a smaller place.

355
0:11:34,22 --> 0:11:35,54
If you earn a good income,

356
0:11:35,54 --> 0:11:36,54
stay in the big city.

357
0:11:36,54 --> 0:11:37,78
If your earnings are modest,

358
0:11:37,78 --> 0:11:39,1
consider returning to your hometown,

359
0:11:39,1 --> 0:11:40,44
or even a third location.

360
0:11:40,44 --> 0:11:42,28
At 40, it’s all about taking it easy.

361
0:11:42,28 --> 0:11:43,64
So, speaking for myself,

362
0:11:43,64 --> 0:11:46,56
a 40-year-old in the media industry is already in a laid-back state.

363
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:48,64
If there weren’t kids to send to school,

364
0:11:48,64 --> 0:11:50,26
there wouldn’t be the issue of picking them up.

365
0:11:50,26 --> 0:11:52,34
Actually, going to Northeast China would be the best choice.

366
0:11:52,34 --> 0:11:54,7
I had thought about my ex-wife taking care of the kids,

367
0:11:54,7 --> 0:11:55,94
if we were to return to Heihe,

368
0:11:55,94 --> 0:11:57,6
for them to go to school there.

369
0:11:57,6 --> 0:11:58,6
Then I'll live in Heihe

370
0:11:58,6 --> 0:11:59,92
There's absolutely no problem

371
0:11:59,92 --> 0:12:1,24
Because for me

372
0:12:1,24 --> 0:12:3,6
Like web novels

373
0:12:3,6 --> 0:12:4,74
Like those writers

374
0:12:4,74 --> 0:12:6,32
Like some social media creators

375
0:12:6,32 --> 0:12:7,42
Musicians and the like

376
0:12:7,42 --> 0:12:9,77
To be honest

377
0:12:9,77 --> 0:12:11,71
We actually have very few social activities on a daily basis

378
0:12:11,71 --> 0:12:15,19
You might notice that my social activities are almost non-existent these days.

379
0:12:15,19 --> 0:12:17,1
I occasionally go out for a meal with someone.

380
0:12:17,1 --> 0:12:18,47
And drinking is pretty rare too.

381
0:12:18,47 --> 0:12:21,5
Although I'm quite outgoing, you see,

382
0:12:21,5 --> 0:12:22,81
I'm not particularly keen on making friends.

383
0:12:22,81 --> 0:12:24,25
So, in many cases,

384
0:12:24,25 --> 0:12:27,3
I try to cut down on social activities as much as possible.

385
0:12:27,3 --> 0:12:29,6
That's why being in Northeast China suits me just fine,

386
0:12:29,6 --> 0:12:32,48
since food and accommodation are affordable.

387
0:12:32,48 --> 0:12:34,0
If I'm being honest

388
0:12:34,0 --> 0:12:34,72
Look at me in Beijing

389
0:12:34,72 --> 0:12:36,44
I've just got a car license plate through the lottery

390
0:12:36,44 --> 0:12:37,12
It's really giving me a headache

391
0:12:37,12 --> 0:12:38,52
I plan to buy a car in half a year

392
0:12:38,52 --> 0:12:39,16
Why

393
0:12:39,16 --> 0:12:40,52
Because I got the license plate through the lottery

394
0:12:40,52 --> 0:12:41,72
I feel like I have to buy a car

395
0:12:41,72 --> 0:12:42,62
I don't have a place to park it

396
0:12:42,62 --> 0:12:43,64
I don’t commute.

397
0:12:43,64 --> 0:12:44,44
I don’t drop off kids.

398
0:12:44,44 --> 0:12:46,44
So what’s the point of having a car?

399
0:12:46,44 --> 0:12:47,9
Parking is tough in Beijing.

400
0:12:47,9 --> 0:12:48,52
Driving is tough too.

401
0:12:48,52 --> 0:12:49,48
So it doesn’t make much sense.

402
0:12:49,48 --> 0:12:50,76
But it’s different in Northeast China.

403
0:12:50,76 --> 0:12:52,34
I can live in a very suburban area.

404
0:12:52,34 --> 0:12:53,54
With a car, I can go anywhere.

405
0:12:53,54 --> 0:12:54,38
You can go buy groceries

406
0:12:54,38 --> 0:12:54,88
You can go

407
0:12:54,88 --> 0:12:57,34
Why is it that in Northeast China, four-wheeled vehicles are considered better than two-wheeled ones?

408
0:12:57,34 --> 0:12:58,92
Because it's cold

409
0:12:58,92 --> 0:13:0,28
Really cold

410
0:13:0,28 --> 0:13:1,58
Right?

411
0:13:1,58 --> 0:13:4,88
Your 400km range suddenly drops to 230, right?

412
0:13:4,88 --> 0:13:7,12
When you ride a motorcycle

413
0:13:7,12 --> 0:13:8,28
You look more beautiful in Beijing

414
0:13:8,28 --> 0:13:10,0
There, it gets down to minus twenty or thirty degrees

415
0:13:10,0 --> 0:13:10,72
You said you couldn't stand it

416
0:13:10,72 --> 0:13:11,44
So, to talk about it

417
0:13:11,44 --> 0:13:13,4
And when people go to cold places

418
0:13:13,4 --> 0:13:15,37
Those bugs and cockroaches

419
0:13:15,37 --> 0:13:17,69
They just don't exist there

420
0:13:17,69 --> 0:13:20,49
The chances of bacteria surviving are low

421
0:13:20,49 --> 0:13:21,65
So, in that sense

422
0:13:21,65 --> 0:13:22,45
You're full of energy and vigor

423
0:13:22,45 --> 0:13:23,93
Everyone eats so well

424
0:13:24,63 --> 0:13:28,13
Especially in places like Tongliao, the food is fantastic

425
0:13:28,13 --> 0:13:32,31
I often wonder why, under these conditions, especially in the east

426
0:13:32,31 --> 0:13:33,47
In the eastern part of Inner Mongolia

427
0:13:33,47 --> 0:13:35,47
Why the conditions in Erenhot are so good

428
0:13:35,47 --> 0:13:41,22
Because it has a culture that combines fishing and hunting, farming, and nomadic herding

429
0:13:41,22 --> 0:13:42,22
A fishing and hunting culture

430
0:13:42,22 --> 0:13:44,98
Many people might only know about the Manchu in this central-northern region

431
0:13:44,98 --> 0:13:46,2
And the Mongolian ethnic group

432
0:13:46,2 --> 0:13:47,78
But not much is known about the Daur people.

433
0:13:47,78 --> 0:13:49,78
Not much is known about the Oroqen and Evenki either.

434
0:13:49,78 --> 0:13:51,76
There are all sorts of ethnic groups, each unique in their own way.

435
0:13:51,76 --> 0:13:55,65
Many of these ethnic groups are not nomadic.

436
0:13:55,65 --> 0:13:56,99
Nor are they agriculturalists.

437
0:13:56,99 --> 0:13:58,71
They are hunter-gatherers.

438
0:13:58,71 --> 0:14:3,26
Hunter-gatherers, nomads, and farmers have all played significant roles in human history.

439
0:14:3,26 --> 0:14:5,8
So, in such places,

440
0:14:5,8 --> 0:14:8,34
why do the young men and women look so good?

441
0:14:8,34 --> 0:14:9,92
Why is your body so robust?

442
0:14:9,92 --> 0:14:12,76
Because you eat everything from flying birds to land animals and fish.

443
0:14:12,76 --> 0:14:13,72
You eat all kinds of things.

444
0:14:13,72 --> 0:14:16,33
You eat fish,

445
0:14:16,33 --> 0:14:18,9
meat, and farm produce.

446
0:14:18,9 --> 0:14:19,73
You have beef, lamb, and fish.

447
0:14:19,73 --> 0:14:20,59
Plus, you farm.

448
0:14:20,59 --> 0:14:23,35
So, it's basically impossible for you to lose weight.

449
0:14:23,35 --> 0:14:25,33
That's why as people get older,

450
0:14:25,33 --> 0:14:26,95
The absorption and metabolism have slowed down.

451
0:14:26,95 --> 0:14:27,87
The absorption isn't as good either.

452
0:14:27,87 --> 0:14:29,59
So, you need to eat some refined foods.

453
0:14:29,59 --> 0:14:33,3
You need to eat some richer foods and let yourself cool down a bit.

454
0:14:33,3 --> 0:14:35,18
So, the same principle applies.

455
0:14:35,18 --> 0:14:36,3
Hokkaido, Japan,

456
0:14:36,3 --> 0:14:38,2
is a great place to visit.

457
0:14:38,2 --> 0:14:39,64
visiting Canada is also a good choice.

458
0:14:39,64 --> 0:14:40,96
because I like the cold climate.

459
0:14:40,96 --> 0:14:42,92
I like places like Russia, where it's cold.

460
0:14:42,92 --> 0:14:44,4
Cold climates contribute to a longer lifespan.

461
0:14:44,4 --> 0:14:46,6
Bacteria don't thrive easily in the cold.

462
0:14:46,6 --> 0:14:47,12
To be honest,

463
0:14:47,12 --> 0:14:48,91
I actually live in Guangdong.

464
0:14:48,91 --> 0:14:49,83
I quite like Guangdong.

465
0:14:49,83 --> 0:14:51,15
But it's so hot there,

466
0:14:51,15 --> 0:14:54,11
and I really can't stand the bugs.

467
0:14:54,11 --> 0:14:55,71
It's wild and humid.

468
0:14:55,71 --> 0:14:57,47
This thing is unbearable for northerners

469
0:14:57,47 --> 0:14:58,71
That's when the characteristics of northerners come out

470
0:14:58,71 --> 0:15:0,11
That's why I have tough skin

471
0:15:0,11 --> 0:15:1,4
Why I have thick fat

472
0:15:1,4 --> 0:15:2,12
Like a Polar Bear

473
0:15:2,12 --> 0:15:4,4
It's due to the cold weather

474
0:15:4,4 --> 0:15:5,52
Living in Canada for a long time

475
0:15:5,52 --> 0:15:7,66
Has developed this cold-adapted physique

476
0:15:7,66 --> 0:15:9,1
Now I'm in Northeast China

477
0:15:9,1 --> 0:15:10,1
I feel full of energy.

478
0:15:10,1 --> 0:15:12,54
I feel like my body temperature and blood pressure are all back to normal.

479
0:15:12,54 --> 0:15:13,74
I always feel uncomfortable once I'm back in Beijing.

480
0:15:13,74 --> 0:15:14,98
Especially during the summer in Beijing.

481
0:15:14,98 --> 0:15:16,44
Oh, it's so uncomfortable.

482
0:15:16,44 --> 0:15:19,48
Especially last year when I went to Shanghai in the summer.

483
0:15:19,48 --> 0:15:21,96
I saw the asphalt on the roads almost melting.

484
0:15:21,96 --> 0:15:23,68
So, as the saying goes, an orange grown south of the Huai River is an orange,

485
0:15:23,68 --> 0:15:24,54
but an orange grown north of the Huai River is a different fruit.

486
0:15:24,54 --> 0:15:27,459
This mole, well, I'm a northerner.

487
0:15:27,459 --> 0:15:28,679
I'm a typical northerner.

488
0:15:28,679 --> 0:15:29,999
So, when it comes to northerners,

489
0:15:29,999 --> 0:15:32,63
they offer you more options,

490
0:15:32,63 --> 0:15:34,3
all of which are cold climate options.

491
0:15:34,3 --> 0:15:34,95
For example, going to Northeast China,

492
0:15:34,95 --> 0:15:35,71
going to Hokkaido,

493
0:15:35,71 --> 0:15:36,51
going to Canada,

494
0:15:36,51 --> 0:15:38,15
while southerners provide different options.

495
0:15:38,15 --> 0:15:39,29
Let's talk about the Greater Bay Area.

496
0:15:39,29 --> 0:15:40,53
And then there's Australia and New Zealand.

497
0:15:40,53 --> 0:15:41,37
So, they are quite different.

498
0:15:41,37 --> 0:15:43,13
It's a place full of sunshine.

499
0:15:43,13 --> 0:15:48,95
So, the living conditions for people in the south and north are really very, very different.

500
0:15:48,95 --> 0:15:50,17
The experiences vary as well.

501
0:15:50,17 --> 0:15:53,4
So listening to Brother Rong can give you an introduction to some of these concepts.

502
0:15:53,4 --> 0:15:55,76
But not all concepts, of course.

503
0:15:55,76 --> 0:15:56,84
For example, going to Xinjiang.

504
0:15:56,84 --> 0:16:0,1
The temperature difference between Southern Xinjiang and Northern Xinjiang can be around 25 degrees.

505
0:16:1,57 --> 0:16:3,78
While it's 30 degrees in the ancient city of Southern Xinjiang, it's only five degrees in other places.

506
0:16:3,78 --> 0:16:5,74
So, for those who go on self-driving tours,

507
0:16:5,74 --> 0:16:6,9
especially those who travel by motorcycle,

508
0:16:6,9 --> 0:16:7,74
if you're heading to Xinjiang,

509
0:16:7,74 --> 0:16:8,98
not preparing two sets of clothes,

510
0:16:8,98 --> 0:16:10,849
that's just asking for trouble.

511
0:16:10,849 --> 0:16:13,489
Four wheels are definitely more convenient than two wheels.

512
0:16:13,489 --> 0:16:14,749
At least they can carry more stuff.

513
0:16:14,749 --> 0:16:15,649
You attach the two wheels

514
0:16:15,649 --> 0:16:16,97
Then you install the trunk

515
0:16:16,97 --> 0:16:18,35
You add the side bags

516
0:16:18,35 --> 0:16:19,45
You can do it

517
0:16:19,45 --> 0:16:20,59
Then add a front box

518
0:16:20,59 --> 0:16:21,7
A center box

519
0:16:21,7 --> 0:16:22,15
How much stuff can you load

520
0:16:22,15 --> 0:16:22,58
Right

521
0:16:22,58 --> 0:16:23,58
And the more you load

522
0:16:23,58 --> 0:16:24,82
You might end up swaying dangerously

523
0:16:24,82 --> 0:16:25,22
Isn't that so

524
0:16:25,22 --> 0:16:28,59
So, motorcycling really tests a person's character

525
0:16:28,59 --> 0:16:30,51
But let's keep going

526
0:16:30,51 --> 0:16:35,6
As the backbone of a family

527
0:16:35,76 --> 0:16:39,23
Northeast China sees a lot of people leaving every year

528
0:16:39,23 --> 0:16:39,91
Why

529
0:16:39,91 --> 0:16:41,55
Because it's hard to find jobs locally

530
0:16:41,55 --> 0:16:43,21
Jobs are really hard to come by

531
0:16:43,21 --> 0:16:44,15
So, to put it this way

532
0:16:44,15 --> 0:16:50,43
But people like us don't have strict location requirements for work

533
0:16:50,43 --> 0:16:52,15
We should actually go

534
0:16:52,15 --> 0:16:55,809
Places like this should be where a northerner should go

535
0:16:55,809 --> 0:16:58,269
Actually, there should be a spirit of rushing to Northeast.

536
0:16:58,269 --> 0:17:0,92
I'm not saying everyone is suited for it

537
0:17:0,92 --> 0:17:2,52
If you have a job locally

538
0:17:2,52 --> 0:17:3,36
If you have a job there

539
0:17:3,36 --> 0:17:6,84
In the northeast, you might not find a job with a high salary

540
0:17:6,84 --> 0:17:8,94
But if you're a web novelist

541
0:17:8,94 --> 0:17:11,46
Or if you work in new media

542
0:17:11,46 --> 0:17:14,67
Or if you transition your life in this direction

543
0:17:14,67 --> 0:17:15,67
Like cross-border e-commerce

544
0:17:15,67 --> 0:17:16,95
It doesn't matter to you

545
0:17:16,95 --> 0:17:18,19
I just shoot videos for Douyin and Kuaishou

546
0:17:18,19 --> 0:17:22,389
So now, more than ever, your lifestyle determines where you can live

547
0:17:22,389 --> 0:17:24,209
How you make money

548
0:17:24,209 --> 0:17:25,55
Decides where you can live

549
0:17:27,43 --> 0:17:32,24
To put it bluntly, if your lifestyle is entirely dependent on the internet, like us

550
0:17:32,24 --> 0:17:34,16
Then you can work remotely

551
0:17:34,16 --> 0:17:37,72
You can completely ignore all the things about your living place

552
0:17:37,72 --> 0:17:41,99
So, I advise those who can adapt to living anywhere in the country

553
0:17:41,99 --> 0:17:43,3
People who can travel and live anywhere

554
0:17:43,3 --> 0:17:43,71
Give it a try

555
0:17:43,71 --> 0:17:45,19
Whether it's the food or the cultural environment in the northeast

556
0:17:45,19 --> 0:17:46,7
Of course, you might not adapt

557
0:17:46,7 --> 0:17:47,43
Because Brother Rong is a tough northerner

558
0:17:47,43 --> 0:17:50,11
Like a bear

559
0:17:50,11 --> 0:17:50,95
Right

560
0:17:50,95 --> 0:17:51,78
So why can't I keep a round face with a beard

561
0:17:51,78 --> 0:17:54,18
If I go to Chengdu

562
0:17:54,18 --> 0:17:55,26
I'm afraid my lifestyle will change drastically

563
0:17:55,26 --> 0:17:58,22
That's how it is

564
0:17:58,22 --> 0:17:58,87
So, let's talk about this episode: the northeast is a good place

565
0:17:58,87 --> 0:18:1,61
If you work in the internet sector

566
0:18:1,61 --> 0:18:5,54
You can consider living there

567
0:18:5,54 --> 0:18:7,32
Settle down and start a family there

568
0:18:7,32 --> 0:18:8,8
Your kids can enjoy the 212-point college entrance exam

569
0:18:8,8 --> 0:18:12,3
You'll be living in one of the most forward-thinking places in China

570
0:18:12,3 --> 0:18:16,23
It's really interesting

571
0:18:16,23 --> 0:18:17,23
Of course

572
0:18:17,23 --> 0:18:17,71
We're not saying we'll settle down forever

573
0:18:17,71 --> 0:18:19,19
We're just saying we'll live there for a while

574
0:18:19,19 --> 0:18:20,75
Always changing, always new

575
0:18:20,75 --> 0:18:21,73
We have four more episodes coming up

576
0:18:21,73 --> 0:18:23,23
Listen to me as I slowly unfold the story
