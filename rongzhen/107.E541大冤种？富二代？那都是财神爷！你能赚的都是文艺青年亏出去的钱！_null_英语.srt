0:0:0,44 --> 0:0:3,52
Hey, you should earn money from the people you dislike

2
0:0:3,52 --> 0:0:4,8
Hi everyone

3
0:0:4,8 --> 0:0:4,84
I'm Rong Zhen

4
0:0:4,84 --> 0:0:6,31
This is Mattress Chat

5
0:0:6,31 --> 0:0:9,85
Everyone knows how I got my first pot of gold.

6
0:0:9,85 --> 0:0:11,43
It was far from honorable

7
0:0:11,43 --> 0:0:12,91
Plagiarism

8
0:0:12,91 --> 0:0:15,7
It all started with academic misconduct

9
0:0:15,7 --> 0:0:18,869
For those wealthy second-generation Chinese in Vancouver

10
0:0:18,869 --> 0:0:21,749
Specializing in writing their assignments

11
0:0:21,749 --> 0:0:23,69
Helping them with their papers

12
0:0:23,69 --> 0:0:24,509
Assisting them in revising their papers

13
0:0:24,509 --> 0:0:25,729
Right?

14
0:0:25,729 --> 0:0:28,65
So, engaging in these gray area activities

15
0:0:28,65 --> 0:0:29,71
Earned the first pot of gold

16
0:0:29,71 --> 0:0:32,75
Of course, why isn't this industry as profitable now

17
0:0:32,75 --> 0:0:35,41
Because you can't reach the high-paying clients

18
0:0:35,41 --> 0:0:37,25
So, in the world

19
0:0:37,25 --> 0:0:38,45
There's a fair principle

20
0:0:38,45 --> 0:0:41,57
which is that as long as you can find a big sucker

21
0:0:41,57 --> 0:0:43,9
you can set the price for your product

22
0:0:43,9 --> 0:0:45,71
meaning you need to find high-quality customers

23
0:0:45,71 --> 0:0:50,35
the high-quality customers you find will eventually pay for your product

24
0:0:50,35 --> 0:0:52,97
instead of manufacturing goods first

25
0:0:52,97 --> 0:0:56,1
and then figuring out how to sell them

26
0:0:56,1 --> 0:0:59,57
you should identify the needs of high-quality customers first

27
0:0:59,57 --> 0:1:4,69
and ensure you can connect with these high-quality customers

28
0:1:4,69 --> 0:1:6,41
Then, for premium customers,

29
0:1:6,41 --> 0:1:9,49
we tailor the products and services they need.

30
0:1:9,49 --> 0:1:11,78
This is the best logic for making money.

31
0:1:11,78 --> 0:1:13,2
Whatever they spit out,

32
0:1:13,2 --> 0:1:14,62
you take in—it’s that simple.

33
0:1:14,62 --> 0:1:16,96
But what’s the point of telling everyone this?

34
0:1:16,96 --> 0:1:20,8
Hey everyone, as you know, I recommended it back then.

35
0:1:20,8 --> 0:1:23,48
don’t open a coffee shop,

36
0:1:23,48 --> 0:1:25,7
don’t open a restaurant.

37
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:27,38
This kind of thing is a money-losing proposition.

38
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:28,14
It can be quite a loss.

39
0:1:28,14 --> 0:1:31,1
I actually delve into studying this group.

40
0:1:31,1 --> 0:1:33,35
Who would want to run a coffee shop?

41
0:1:33,35 --> 0:1:35,33
Who would want to do baking?

42
0:1:35,33 --> 0:1:37,19
Who would want to work in food?

43
0:1:37,19 --> 0:1:40,9
You'll find that these artistic young people in the city,

44
0:1:40,9 --> 0:1:41,669
they love doing this kind of work.

45
0:1:41,669 --> 0:1:43,989
I have a lot of artistic young people around me.

46
0:1:43,989 --> 0:1:45,869
They have a passion for art.

47
0:1:45,869 --> 0:1:47,289
They yearn for poetry and distant places.

48
0:1:47,289 --> 0:1:48,789
They enjoy a beautiful life.

49
0:1:48,789 --> 0:1:50,429
They organize idealistic events.

50
0:1:50,429 --> 0:1:53,869
But in real life, they tend to be quite unrestrained and free-spirited.

51
0:1:53,869 --> 0:1:55,2
Their lives are relatively comfortable.

52
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:56,64
They are often pampered.

53
0:1:56,64 --> 0:1:58,96
They usually come from wealthy families.

54
0:1:58,96 --> 0:2:1,24
Silly sons and silly daughters.

55
0:2:1,24 --> 0:2:2,56
People like that

56
0:2:2,56 --> 0:2:5,36
I actually despise and loathe

57
0:2:5,36 --> 0:2:6,48
Just like when I was in Beijing

58
0:2:6,48 --> 0:2:9,34
the place I hated the most was 798

59
0:2:9,34 --> 0:2:12,88
because the people in 798 and I are completely at odds

60
0:2:12,88 --> 0:2:16,42
because I believe a person's attire and appearance

61
0:2:16,42 --> 0:2:19,829
should reflect their actual financial status

62
0:2:19,829 --> 0:2:20,769
however

63
0:2:20,769 --> 0:2:23,829
I clearly haven’t reflected my actual financial status

64
0:2:23,829 --> 0:2:25,669
I wouldn’t buy it even if I had the money.

65
0:2:25,669 --> 0:2:28,54
I only have a few pairs of shoes and a few pieces of clothing.

66
0:2:28,54 --> 0:2:30,58
And I never replace them until they’re completely worn out.

67
0:2:30,58 --> 0:2:31,46
It’s the same with my shoes.

68
0:2:31,46 --> 0:2:32,66
I never replace them until they’re completely worn out.

69
0:2:32,66 --> 0:2:33,6
The second pair.

70
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:34,74
I’ve been like this for more than just the past few years.

71
0:2:34,74 --> 0:2:35,7
Back in high school,

72
0:2:35,7 --> 0:2:36,6
and even in middle school.

73
0:2:36,6 --> 0:2:39,4
In junior high, I only had a pair of Asics.

74
0:2:39,4 --> 0:2:41,58
This running shoe cost 698.

75
0:2:41,58 --> 0:2:43,68
When I was in high school, I only had a 399

76
0:2:43,68 --> 0:2:44,82
Li-Ning basketball shoe.

77
0:2:44,82 --> 0:2:47,37
In college, I changed shoes quite a bit.

78
0:2:47,37 --> 0:2:48,57
Shoes made in Putian, yeah.

79
0:2:48,57 --> 0:2:50,57
But they usually cost around one or two hundred.

80
0:2:50,57 --> 0:2:51,31
Pretty cheap.

81
0:2:51,31 --> 0:2:54,25
But later, I went abroad for my studies.

82
0:2:54,25 --> 0:2:56,51
I'm still wearing the shoes from junior high.

83
0:2:56,51 --> 0:2:59,239
Those Asics are really designed for jogging.

84
0:2:59,239 --> 0:3:0,479
They are truly well-made.

85
0:3:0,479 --> 0:3:1,799
Because they are quite expensive.

86
0:3:1,799 --> 0:3:2,799
Over 690 bucks.

87
0:3:2,799 --> 0:3:4,219
So I've worn them for many years.

88
0:3:4,219 --> 0:3:6,209
The soles have worn through.

89
0:3:6,209 --> 0:3:8,249
The entire sole has worn through.

90
0:3:8,249 --> 0:3:9,169
A hole has appeared.

91
0:3:9,169 --> 0:3:10,209
It's not a puncture

92
0:3:10,209 --> 0:3:11,849
but rather worn thin and flat

93
0:3:11,849 --> 0:3:14,64
a large hole formed on the sole

94
0:3:14,64 --> 0:3:16,0
and it just tears easily

95
0:3:16,0 --> 0:3:16,84
That's what it is

96
0:3:16,84 --> 0:3:17,84
I've been wearing it for so many years

97
0:3:17,84 --> 0:3:20,64
Do you think it's because I can't afford to buy new ones?

98
0:3:20,64 --> 0:3:21,2
No, it's not that

99
0:3:21,2 --> 0:3:21,56
Right?

100
0:3:21,56 --> 0:3:23,24
It's just that I dislike this kind of thing

101
0:3:23,24 --> 0:3:24,8
I'm willing to spend money on electronics, though.

102
0:3:24,8 --> 0:3:25,8
Right?

103
0:3:25,8 --> 0:3:26,95
I'm also willing to spend money on studying abroad.

104
0:3:26,95 --> 0:3:29,13
I just compared the expenses for my study abroad.

105
0:3:29,13 --> 0:3:30,37
with that of Xiao Bawang.

106
0:3:30,37 --> 0:3:34,16
He announced the actual cost of the diploma mill in the U.S.

107
0:3:34,16 --> 0:3:35,46
These easy credits.

108
0:3:35,46 --> 0:3:37,8
I paid 1,500 Canadian dollars.

109
0:3:37,8 --> 0:3:39,17
His Yi Xue score is only 196 dollars.

110
0:3:39,17 --> 0:3:40,11
So that's it.

111
0:3:40,11 --> 0:3:42,3
I'm willing to spend money in many areas.

112
0:3:42,3 --> 0:3:44,71
But visiting Vancouver has one advantage though.

113
0:3:44,71 --> 0:3:46,51
You get to meet a lot of rich second-generation kids.

114
0:3:46,51 --> 0:3:47,57
You get to meet a lot of rich heirs.

115
0:3:47,57 --> 0:3:49,77
The losses of these rich heirs are your gains.

116
0:3:49,77 --> 0:3:52,65
Many of them have dreams.

117
0:3:52,65 --> 0:3:54,99
Like those who want to open a coffee shop.

118
0:3:54,99 --> 0:3:56,97
Their loss is your gain.

119
0:3:56,97 --> 0:3:59,63
So, you need to shift your perspective.

120
0:3:59,63 --> 0:4:1,59
These people open coffee shops,

121
0:4:1,59 --> 0:4:4,17
you should consider getting into barista training,

122
0:4:4,17 --> 0:4:6,29
or coffee shop renovations,

123
0:4:6,29 --> 0:4:7,75
or coffee machines,

124
0:4:7,75 --> 0:4:9,69
buying and selling used coffee machines,

125
0:4:9,69 --> 0:4:11,85
it's all about supply and demand,

126
0:4:11,85 --> 0:4:12,94
and then

127
0:4:12,94 --> 0:4:17,4
Doing the wholesale business of Coffee Beans for that coffee shop

128
0:4:17,4 --> 0:4:20,2
These are what they call upstream businesses.

129
0:4:20,2 --> 0:4:22,739
You can make a profit where they lose money.

130
0:4:22,739 --> 0:4:23,579
The money that comes out of it.

131
0:4:23,579 --> 0:4:25,699
So, a lot of times, people need to shift their mindset.

132
0:4:25,699 --> 0:4:27,76
Talking about economic upturns and downturns,

133
0:4:27,76 --> 0:4:30,46
that's all relative to the overall environment.

134
0:4:30,46 --> 0:4:33,16
But when it comes to specific industries, there are always some making money,

135
0:4:33,16 --> 0:4:35,55
and there are always some losing money.

136
0:4:35,55 --> 0:4:39,63
So, it's just that the real estate game doesn't work anymore.

137
0:4:39,63 --> 0:4:40,7
Right?

138
0:4:40,7 --> 0:4:41,16
So there's nothing to worry about.

139
0:4:41,16 --> 0:4:44,24
People will always want to spend their money here.

140
0:4:44,24 --> 0:4:47,4
So you just need to identify a specific group's needs.

141
0:4:47,4 --> 0:4:50,73
Develop products and services for them.

142
0:4:51,4 --> 0:4:54,44
For example, it's really hard for college students to find jobs these days.

143
0:4:54,44 --> 0:4:55,8
What should you do?

144
0:4:55,8 --> 0:4:57,74
Now, so many people are taking the postgraduate or civil service exams.

145
0:4:57,74 --> 0:4:59,8
The chances of passing the postgraduate or civil service exams are so low

146
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:1,75
but they insist on taking them

147
0:5:1,75 --> 0:5:4,19
insist on taking the civil service exam

148
0:5:4,19 --> 0:5:6,199
people who take the exam for 78 years are not uncommon

149
0:5:6,199 --> 0:5:7,519
before reaching the age limit

150
0:5:7,519 --> 0:5:9,199
they will persist in taking the exam

151
0:5:9,199 --> 0:5:10,759
the family would rather have him rely on them

152
0:5:10,759 --> 0:5:11,679
than let him take the exam

153
0:5:11,679 --> 0:5:13,79
despite clearly not having the capability

154
0:5:13,79 --> 0:5:14,879
It has to be 1978, huh?

155
0:5:14,879 --> 0:5:16,399
If he doesn’t pass, he won’t hate the owner so much.

156
0:5:16,399 --> 0:5:17,639
And he’s even preparing for the civil service exam full-time.

157
0:5:17,639 --> 0:5:18,919
He’s also planning to retake the postgraduate entrance exam.

158
0:5:18,919 --> 0:5:19,98
Third or fourth attempt, you know.

159
0:5:19,98 --> 0:5:22,2
So where is all this money going?

160
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:23,5
Most of it goes to tutoring classes.

161
0:5:23,5 --> 0:5:24,66
Spent on tutoring courses.

162
0:5:24,66 --> 0:5:27,78
So you should open one of these tutoring classes.

163
0:5:27,78 --> 0:5:28,82
Offering such tutoring classes

164
0:5:28,82 --> 0:5:31,54
means becoming a supplier for such demands

165
0:5:31,54 --> 0:5:33,22
So this is the money you should be earning

166
0:5:33,22 --> 0:5:37,94
That’s why in this world, where some people lose money in certain areas

167
0:5:37,94 --> 0:5:39,88
there are always others who make money in other areas

168
0:5:39,88 --> 0:5:42,1
For example, many people spend money on buying grains

169
0:5:42,1 --> 0:5:43,44
or figurines

170
0:5:43,44 --> 0:5:45,56
Many people spend money on catching dolls

171
0:5:45,56 --> 0:5:47,45
Many people spend money on karaoke sessions

172
0:5:47,45 --> 0:5:48,95
Many people spend money on travel

173
0:5:48,95 --> 0:5:50,49
But where does this money go?

174
0:5:50,49 --> 0:5:50,85
Right?

175
0:5:50,85 --> 0:5:54,23
Broadly speaking, it’s earned by certain industries

176
0:5:54,23 --> 0:5:56,71
However, if we look at niche markets

177
0:5:56,71 --> 0:5:59,82
If you can grasp the main supply for niche demands

178
0:5:59,82 --> 0:6:1,42
That’s how the money flows

179
0:6:1,42 --> 0:6:2,46
Of course, when we talk about it

180
0:6:2,46 --> 0:6:3,97
You grow millet

181
0:6:3,97 --> 0:6:5,95
You could be sued by the copyright holder, right?

182
0:6:5,95 --> 0:6:8,51
There are some things you still shouldn't touch, though.

183
0:6:8,51 --> 0:6:9,81
Some things are really off-limits.

184
0:6:9,81 --> 0:6:12,12
But remember, where there's demand, there's supply.

185
0:6:12,12 --> 0:6:13,64
We're in the era of singles now.

186
0:6:13,64 --> 0:6:16,28
In the singles era, there are more big spenders giving gifts.

187
0:6:16,28 --> 0:6:16,85
Right?

188
0:6:16,85 --> 0:6:18,37
There are many other needs as well.

189
0:6:18,37 --> 0:6:19,85
Like the demand for the Holy Grail and such.

190
0:6:19,85 --> 0:6:22,87
His needs are changing.

191
0:6:22,87 --> 0:6:25,15
Or his needs remain the same.

192
0:6:25,15 --> 0:6:26,59
It's still the same need.

193
0:6:26,59 --> 0:6:28,83
But the way it's provided has changed.

194
0:6:28,83 --> 0:6:30,63
It has become different products.

195
0:6:30,63 --> 0:6:32,3
It has become different services.

196
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:36,19
So you need to follow the actual development in society.

197
0:6:36,19 --> 0:6:37,87
These changes.

198
0:6:37,87 --> 0:6:39,93
Where they are heading.

199
0:6:39,93 --> 0:6:42,72
You should change in the same direction.

200
0:6:42,72 --> 0:6:44,68
Regardless of what it turns into.

201
0:6:44,68 --> 0:6:46,4
Or when it changes.

202
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:48,76
Follow the changes in societal development.

203
0:6:48,76 --> 0:6:49,98
Changes in policy.

204
0:6:49,98 --> 0:6:52,26
Analyze what's profitable now.

205
0:6:52,26 --> 0:6:54,22
What new demands have grown larger.

206
0:6:54,22 --> 0:6:56,42
What kind of demand is widespread.

207
0:6:56,42 --> 0:6:57,72
I'll tell you again,

208
0:6:57,72 --> 0:6:59,2
Products can be sold worldwide.

209
0:6:59,2 --> 0:7:0,14
They can be sold nationwide.

210
0:7:0,14 --> 0:7:1,549
Services can only be provided locally.

211
0:7:1,549 --> 0:7:2,889
That's a basic principle.

212
0:7:2,889 --> 0:7:4,749
