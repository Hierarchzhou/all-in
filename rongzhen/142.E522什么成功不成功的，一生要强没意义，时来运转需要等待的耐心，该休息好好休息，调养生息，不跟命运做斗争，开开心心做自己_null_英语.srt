1
0:0:0,58 --> 0:0:2,9
Ah, it’s episode 522.

2
0:0:2,9 --> 0:0:4,91
I’m adding an extra episode today.

3
0:0:4,91 --> 0:0:6,39
Why the extra episode?

4
0:0:6,39 --> 0:0:11,55
Because we’ve seen a catastrophic drop in global stock markets today.

5
0:0:11,55 --> 0:0:15,31
Actually, I’ve been wanting to talk about this for a few days now.

6
0:0:15,31 --> 0:0:18,65
About how to lay low and wait for better times.

7
0:0:18,65 --> 0:0:21,46
How to navigate through your life when things aren’t going so well.

8
0:0:21,46 --> 0:0:24,32
When the luck in your life isn’t on your side.

9
0:0:24,32 --> 0:0:26,56
Don’t struggle against fate.

10
0:0:26,56 --> 0:0:30,1
Just go home and read some books, right?

11
0:0:30,1 --> 0:0:32,3
Play some games,

12
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:33,97
Ancient people would play the zither,

13
0:0:33,97 --> 0:0:34,79
Compose some poems,

14
0:0:34,79 --> 0:0:35,85
Go fishing, and such.

15
0:0:35,85 --> 0:0:37,15
I'll open the door for my kitten,

16
0:0:37,15 --> 0:0:39,2
Wait a moment, go out.

17
0:0:39,2 --> 0:0:39,84
Go out.

18
0:0:39,84 --> 0:0:41,12
Luna

19
0:0:43,36 --> 0:0:49,98
Well, when I was young, I wasn't particularly a believer in fate.

20
0:0:49,98 --> 0:0:52,75
I always thought that our destiny is in our own hands.

21
0:0:52,75 --> 0:0:56,15
I still believe that destiny is in our own hands.

22
0:0:56,15 --> 0:1:0,7
However, when it comes to certain events in life,

23
0:1:0,7 --> 0:1:1,57
I feel that most of the time,

24
0:1:1,57 --> 0:1:2,19
when doing things,

25
0:1:2,19 --> 0:1:4,78
if you want to strive for excellence,

26
0:1:4,78 --> 0:1:5,82
strive for success,

27
0:1:5,82 --> 0:1:7,28
it’s not an easy task.

28
0:1:7,28 --> 0:1:9,13
It takes a bit of serendipity

29
0:1:9,13 --> 0:1:11,17
It needs to be the right moment

30
0:1:11,17 --> 0:1:14,37
And you did the right thing at the right time

31
0:1:14,37 --> 0:1:17,27
Clearly, it’s not the right time now

32
0:1:17,27 --> 0:1:19,39
For example, when I went to the comic convention

33
0:1:19,39 --> 0:1:23,89
I had a small speech for about 30 minutes

34
0:1:23,89 --> 0:1:25,43
I have a brief talk every day

35
0:1:25,43 --> 0:1:27,15
And I basically talked about

36
0:1:27,15 --> 0:1:29,17
The strategies for starting a media account

37
0:1:29,17 --> 0:1:31,6
How do you go about creating a channel or something like that?

38
0:1:31,6 --> 0:1:32,9
Then someone reported me.

39
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:34,18
Just because I said one thing.

40
0:1:34,18 --> 0:1:36,84
What I said was actually a fair statement.

41
0:1:36,84 --> 0:1:38,32
Let me repeat this for you.

42
0:1:38,32 --> 0:1:39,8
What did I say?

43
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:41,18
Then you tell me if it’s fair or not.

44
0:1:41,18 --> 0:1:43,24
I said I started college in 03.

45
0:1:43,24 --> 0:1:43,7
Right?

46
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:46,24
Back then, after I came out, it was 358 thousand

47
0:1:46,24 --> 0:1:49,2
And I thought, finding jobs for college graduates nowadays is so tough

48
0:1:49,2 --> 0:1:50,32
It's also 358 thousand

49
0:1:50,32 --> 0:1:52,62
Housing prices have gone up over the past 20 years, right?

50
0:1:52,62 --> 0:1:54,42
But salaries haven't risen

51
0:1:54,42 --> 0:1:56,16
I feel that the young people today have it really hard

52
0:1:56,16 --> 0:1:58,19
So I said this much

53
0:1:58,19 --> 0:1:59,53
Actually, if you look at it

54
0:1:59,53 --> 0:2:0,95
I've done so many live streams

55
0:2:0,95 --> 0:2:2,25
Hundreds of live streams

56
0:2:2,25 --> 0:2:3,65
Thousands of videos

57
0:2:3,65 --> 0:2:6,69
I still only have three videos to this day

58
0:2:6,69 --> 0:2:9,29
Those are the same three videos from my Weibo days

59
0:2:9,29 --> 0:2:10,25
There was an issue

60
0:2:10,25 --> 0:2:12,36
So I took the initiative to remove and delist them

61
0:2:12,36 --> 0:2:15,24
I’ve never had any trouble with the review process

62
0:2:15,24 --> 0:2:17,68
Or been taken down due to complaints or anything like that

63
0:2:17,68 --> 0:2:21,13
So it shows that I’ve never really had any extreme views

64
0:2:21,13 --> 0:2:22,89
He's just speaking the truth

65
0:2:22,89 --> 0:2:24,41
But let me tell you, Brother Rong

66
0:2:24,41 --> 0:2:27,759
I was chatting in the group the other day

67
0:2:27,759 --> 0:2:32,48
We were discussing who understands what an unsuccessful life looks like

68
0:2:32,48 --> 0:2:35,85
Because I'm not a successful example

69
0:2:35,85 --> 0:2:39,85
A truly successful example should be like Lei Jun

70
0:2:39,85 --> 0:2:43,57
Pang Donglai is a very inspiring and

71
0:2:43,57 --> 0:2:44,93
highly successful one

72
0:2:44,93 --> 0:2:46,82
an example from the intelligentsia

73
0:2:46,82 --> 0:2:47,64
A top student

74
0:2:47,64 --> 0:2:50,12
one is a businessman who came from the grassroots

75
0:2:50,12 --> 0:2:52,1
they are very conscientious

76
0:2:52,1 --> 0:2:53,6
and in comparison

77
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:55,2
especially this Xiaomi now

78
0:2:55,2 --> 0:2:57,32
Su Qi used to be so impressive

79
0:2:57,32 --> 0:2:58,24
but now there's another issue

80
0:2:58,24 --> 0:2:59,68
there's a problem with public relations again

81
0:2:59,68 --> 0:3:2,36
so I increasingly feel that Lei Jun is actually a pretty good person

82
0:3:2,36 --> 0:3:3,829
Such a responsible person.

83
0:3:3,829 --> 0:3:5,429
A couple of days ago, a Xiaomi fan scolded me.

84
0:3:5,429 --> 0:3:7,949
I wonder how I would feel if I said something like that these days.

85
0:3:7,949 --> 0:3:9,189
Because whatever I say, it evokes some feeling.

86
0:3:9,189 --> 0:3:12,52
I'm not basing this on current events.

87
0:3:12,52 --> 0:3:13,14
This comes from...

88
0:3:13,14 --> 0:3:15,44
Rather, it comes from my own personal feelings.

89
0:3:15,44 --> 0:3:16,86
Speaking of not being successful,

90
0:3:16,86 --> 0:3:19,56
Actually, I can offer more insights to everyone.

91
0:3:19,56 --> 0:3:20,36
You see,

92
0:3:20,36 --> 0:3:23,5
I actually started back in 2002,

93
0:3:23,5 --> 0:3:24,54
when classes were divided into science and arts streams.

94
0:3:24,54 --> 0:3:27,12
I should have been placed in the arts stream back then.

95
0:3:27,12 --> 0:3:29,58
Sometimes in my dreams, I find myself back in high school,

96
0:3:29,58 --> 0:3:31,24
re-taking the college entrance exam.

97
0:3:31,24 --> 0:3:32,48
This shows that,

98
0:3:32,48 --> 0:3:35,18
it's something I deeply regret.

99
0:3:35,18 --> 0:3:36,56
After all these years of education,

100
0:3:36,56 --> 0:3:37,66
In the end, I got into a second-tier university.

101
0:3:37,66 --> 0:3:39,7
Computer science wasn't even my favorite major.

102
0:3:39,7 --> 0:3:40,88
Right?

103
0:3:40,88 --> 0:3:42,2
And art wasn't really mentioned either.

104
0:3:42,2 --> 0:3:42,96
I started right away.

105
0:3:42,96 --> 0:3:45,14
But then I took a big detour.

106
0:3:45,14 --> 0:3:45,84
I went to Europe.

107
0:3:45,84 --> 0:3:47,8
Then I headed to the United States.

108
0:3:47,8 --> 0:3:49,54
That's where I finally learned what I wanted to learn.

109
0:3:49,54 --> 0:3:50,54
Spent a fortune

110
0:3:50,54 --> 0:3:52,2
Wasted a lot of time

111
0:3:52,2 --> 0:3:53,84
Youth has slipped away

112
0:3:53,84 --> 0:3:55,58
Until one is in their late thirties

113
0:3:55,58 --> 0:3:56,66
This person finally succeeds

114
0:3:56,66 --> 0:3:57,24
Right?

115
0:3:57,24 --> 0:3:59,6
But this isn't success by worldly standards

116
0:3:59,6 --> 0:4:1,4
We can't say we've reached the pinnacle

117
0:4:1,4 --> 0:4:1,76
Isn't it?

118
0:4:1,76 --> 0:4:4,2
But in the end, that's how it is.

119
0:4:4,2 --> 0:4:6,32
Looking back at the past 20 years,

120
0:4:6,32 --> 0:4:7,68
We finally have a chance to catch our breath.

121
0:4:7,68 --> 0:4:9,44
At least we can take a breather now.

122
0:4:9,44 --> 0:4:10,72
Well, how to put it,

123
0:4:10,72 --> 0:4:16,239
You were confused at the time, being in the midst of it all.

124
0:4:16,239 --> 0:4:17,599
Sometimes, like me back then,

125
0:4:17,599 --> 0:4:19,519
I initially thought my major wasn't good enough.

126
0:4:19,519 --> 0:4:21,859
I wanted to go out and study it again.

127
0:4:21,859 --> 0:4:23,36
I want to switch to a different major.

128
0:4:23,36 --> 0:4:24,74
It feels quite simple.

129
0:4:24,74 --> 0:4:26,6
But since I'm going to France,

130
0:4:26,6 --> 0:4:28,4
I have to relearn French.

131
0:4:28,4 --> 0:4:30,4
I'm already in my mid-twenties.

132
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:31,68
Starting to learn French,

133
0:4:31,68 --> 0:4:34,62
Then I went to Canada and had to take the IELTS.

134
0:4:34,62 --> 0:4:36,4
By that time, I was 26.

135
0:4:36,4 --> 0:4:37,44
I had to take the IELTS.

136
0:4:37,44 --> 0:4:39,12
It's just really tough, you know.

137
0:4:39,12 --> 0:4:40,96
Everyone else goes out to study for a master's degree.

138
0:4:40,96 --> 0:4:44,18
I've gone out four times, and all for bachelor's degrees.

139
0:4:44,18 --> 0:4:45,98
So, this is the situation.

140
0:4:45,98 --> 0:4:48,48
But I won’t do it unless it’s something I like.

141
0:4:48,48 --> 0:4:50,28
I can’t feel settled until I finish studying what I love.

142
0:4:50,28 --> 0:4:51,74
I wouldn’t feel at ease.

143
0:4:51,74 --> 0:4:53,8
Others study one major.

144
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:53,68
And then they dislike it.

145
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:55,28
People often switch majors for postgraduate studies

146
0:4:55,28 --> 0:4:57,29
or they just muddle through their jobs

147
0:4:57,29 --> 0:4:58,49
and just do the work directly

148
0:4:58,49 --> 0:5:1,51
I, on the other hand, am quite a believer in the power of education

149
0:5:1,51 --> 0:5:2,67
when it comes to academic qualifications

150
0:5:2,67 --> 0:5:3,65
especially foreign degrees

151
0:5:3,65 --> 0:5:5,83
I have a very high regard for them

152
0:5:5,83 --> 0:5:7,79
but to be honest, at that time

153
0:5:7,79 --> 0:5:9,93
the family unfortunately lacked the financial means

154
0:5:9,93 --> 0:5:13,75
Most of the time, it was my relatives who helped me a lot.

155
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:16,61
Uncle helped me a great deal.

156
0:5:16,61 --> 0:5:19,77
At that time, my parents didn't have much money.

157
0:5:19,77 --> 0:5:20,77
Often times,

158
0:5:20,77 --> 0:5:21,41
As everyone knows,

159
0:5:21,41 --> 0:5:24,59
I didn't do much serious studying when I was in school.

160
0:5:24,59 --> 0:5:26,43
I tried all sorts of ways to make money.

161
0:5:26,43 --> 0:5:26,99
I was short of money.

162
0:5:26,99 --> 0:5:31,23
Sometimes, it can be quite painful in your daily life.

163
0:5:31,23 --> 0:5:32,95
But in terms of ability,

164
0:5:32,95 --> 0:5:34,91
it will inspire some of your capabilities,

165
0:5:34,91 --> 0:5:36,27
so I made a bit of money,

166
0:5:36,27 --> 0:5:37,39
earned a little cash,

167
0:5:37,39 --> 0:5:38,97
though I wouldn't call it a small fortune,

168
0:5:38,97 --> 0:5:40,65
but I ended up losing it all again,

169
0:5:40,65 --> 0:5:42,35
that's just my bad luck,

170
0:5:42,35 --> 0:5:46,53
after learning so much,

171
0:5:46,53 --> 0:5:48,45
the fortune teller told me,

172
0:5:48,45 --> 0:5:50,33
You’re destined for a life of hard work from a young age.

173
0:5:50,33 --> 0:5:51,59
Whether it’s palm reading,

174
0:5:51,59 --> 0:5:52,89
or looking at facial features,

175
0:5:52,89 --> 0:5:55,79
or checking the Zi Wei Dou Shu and the Eight Characters of Birth,

176
0:5:55,79 --> 0:5:59,56
or even using Tarot cards and other tools,

177
0:5:59,56 --> 0:6:1,28
and even Nordic rune stones were used,

178
0:6:1,28 --> 0:6:1,5
the calculations,

179
0:6:1,5 --> 0:6:3,14
all led to the same result,

180
0:6:3,14 --> 0:6:5,51
so we call this cross-referencing.

181
0:6:5,51 --> 0:6:7,83
From multiple sources and perspectives

182
0:6:7,83 --> 0:6:9,39
It's like asking an AI

183
0:6:9,39 --> 0:6:10,5
Don't just ask DeepSick

184
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:11,52
Ask Douban as well

185
0:6:11,52 --> 0:6:12,74
Ask KIMI too, right

186
0:6:12,74 --> 0:6:13,9
Ask iFLYTEK as well

187
0:6:13,9 --> 0:6:16,33
Ask ChatGPT too

188
0:6:16,61 --> 0:6:18,55
What’s it called, that thing from Musk

189
0:6:18,55 --> 0:6:19,61
I won’t mention that one

190
0:6:19,61 --> 0:6:21,1
That big fool Musk

191
0:6:21,1 --> 0:6:23,9
Anyway

192
0:6:23,9 --> 0:6:25,319
It's a hard life from a young age

193
0:6:25,319 --> 0:6:27,659
You'll spend all the money you earn when you're young

194
0:6:27,659 --> 0:6:30,53
And I will keep making you suffer

195
0:6:30,53 --> 0:6:34,81
But you'll feel that during that period

196
0:6:34,81 --> 0:6:36,6
Some of my

197
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:39,14
For example, the feeling of suffering and being mistreated

198
0:6:39,14 --> 0:6:40,62
Gradually turned into me

199
0:6:40,62 --> 0:6:43,77
Empathy is part of this imaginative ability.

200
0:6:43,77 --> 0:6:46,53
He will also gradually internalize some things.

201
0:6:46,53 --> 0:6:48,91
Of course, if we can avoid suffering,

202
0:6:48,91 --> 0:6:50,48
we should try not to endure it.

203
0:6:50,48 --> 0:6:52,88
But hardship also has its power.

204
0:6:52,88 --> 0:6:54,6
As long as you face it head-on,

205
0:6:54,6 --> 0:6:55,51
it has the power to shape you.

206
0:6:55,51 --> 0:6:57,47
And I don’t want to say anything

207
0:6:57,47 --> 0:6:59,7
that sounds cliché.

208
0:6:59,7 --> 0:7:0,39
Encourage everyone to do their best

209
0:7:0,39 --> 0:7:1,77
This thing is not interesting

210
0:7:1,77 --> 0:7:3,21
But I want to tell you all

211
0:7:3,21 --> 0:7:5,47
It's this bitter thing, you know

212
0:7:5,47 --> 0:7:7,39
When averaged over each day

213
0:7:7,39 --> 0:7:8,93
It's just boring

214
0:7:8,93 --> 0:7:10,55
It's just not pleasant

215
0:7:10,55 --> 0:7:13,27
But it's not something you should dwell on every day

216
0:7:13,27 --> 0:7:14,48
It's just uncomfortable

217
0:7:14,48 --> 0:7:15,68
If you think about it

218
0:7:15,68 --> 0:7:16,72
This is how it works

219
0:7:16,72 --> 0:7:18,88
If I had started thinking about it 20 years ago

220
0:7:18,88 --> 0:7:20,36
I would have pondered

221
0:7:20,36 --> 0:7:22,76
Oh, it turns out I only got lucky at 37

222
0:7:22,76 --> 0:7:25,3
Then I would have skipped all those years

223
0:7:25,3 --> 0:7:27,31
Then your life would have just skipped over

224
0:7:27,31 --> 0:7:29,15
Actually, during this time

225
0:7:29,15 --> 0:7:32,25
Your so-called success would have been about making money

226
0:7:32,25 --> 0:7:34,23
Back when you weren't making money

227
0:7:34,23 --> 0:7:37,16
your life wasn't a waste, you know

228
0:7:37,16 --> 0:7:39,74
and when you finally start earning

229
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:42,56
it's all connected to every day before

230
0:7:42,56 --> 0:7:45,32
can you say that the years of your hard work were for nothing?

231
0:7:45,32 --> 0:7:47,44
they've become part of your bones and muscles

232
0:7:47,44 --> 0:7:49,2
that's how it often goes

233
0:7:49,2 --> 0:7:50,7
so I recommend that everyone

234
0:7:50,7 --> 0:7:53,24
if you've been sending out hundreds of resumes now

235
0:7:53,24 --> 0:7:54,26
Can't find a job

236
0:7:54,26 --> 0:7:58,75
Or you're currently in a job you dislike

237
0:7:58,75 --> 0:8:0,55
Or no matter what your current situation is

238
0:8:0,55 --> 0:8:3,3
Or you're recovering from an illness

239
0:8:3,3 --> 0:8:5,35
As long as your basic living needs are met

240
0:8:5,35 --> 0:8:7,25
You won't suddenly starve

241
0:8:7,25 --> 0:8:9,88
Or run out of money immediately

242
0:8:9,88 --> 0:8:12,62
Such as ending up on the streets

243
0:8:12,62 --> 0:8:15,51
You must be able to hold on

244
0:8:15,67 --> 0:8:18,75
Try to take good care of yourself

245
0:8:18,75 --> 0:8:19,47
And

246
0:8:19,47 --> 0:8:20,35
No matter what

247
0:8:20,35 --> 0:8:21,87
Don't overthink it

248
0:8:21,87 --> 0:8:24,39
Don't worry about the uncertain future

249
0:8:24,39 --> 0:8:26,69
Or what the distant future holds

250
0:8:26,69 --> 0:8:28,38
What the world will be like in the future

251
0:8:28,38 --> 0:8:29,26
What will become of me

252
0:8:29,26 --> 0:8:30,3
Don't dwell on it

253
0:8:30,3 --> 0:8:31,42
Make the most of today.

254
0:8:31,42 --> 0:8:35,4
We have plenty of food and water today.

255
0:8:35,4 --> 0:8:36,32
The air is fresh.

256
0:8:36,32 --> 0:8:37,74
Look at how much sunshine there is.

257
0:8:37,74 --> 0:8:39,26
Just get a good night’s sleep.

258
0:8:39,26 --> 0:8:40,42
When it comes to many things,

259
0:8:40,42 --> 0:8:41,56
it’s about not rushing.

260
0:8:41,56 --> 0:8:43,18
Your mood swings,

261
0:8:43,18 --> 0:8:46,49
in the grand scheme of things, don’t really matter.

262
0:8:46,49 --> 0:8:48,13
And you must believe this one thing

263
0:8:48,13 --> 0:8:49,25
no matter what happens

264
0:8:49,25 --> 0:8:52,7
if we look back at the past decade or so now

265
0:8:52,7 --> 0:8:55,51
we actually feel that those days were pretty good for everyone

266
0:8:55,51 --> 0:8:56,41
it's tough now

267
0:8:56,41 --> 0:8:58,51
but back then, it was tough too

268
0:8:58,51 --> 0:9:1,329
it was still really hard back then

269
0:9:1,329 --> 0:9:3,329
you never think the present is easy

270
0:9:3,329 --> 0:9:6,29
because you can't compare it to anything else

271
0:9:6,29 --> 0:9:6,569
When compared

272
0:9:6,569 --> 0:9:7,369
in the long run

273
0:9:7,369 --> 0:9:8,81
you might feel it’s different

274
0:9:8,81 --> 0:9:11,33
but we also say, regarding all these things

275
0:9:11,33 --> 0:9:12,33
are they really that important?

276
0:9:12,33 --> 0:9:14,1
these things aren’t actually important

277
0:9:14,1 --> 0:9:15,61
these things aren’t really significant

278
0:9:15,61 --> 0:9:17,85
what truly matters is how you feel inside

279
0:9:17,85 --> 0:9:20,13
do you feel that things are good now?'

280
0:9:20,13 --> 0:9:23,13
Let's look at Japan's so-called lost 30 years

281
0:9:23,13 --> 0:9:24,69
The 30 years following the bubble economy

282
0:9:24,69 --> 0:9:27,5
In many cases, it's also about industries

283
0:9:27,5 --> 0:9:28,94
Some industries have become less profitable

284
0:9:28,94 --> 0:9:30,66
Some industries can rise and fall

285
0:9:30,66 --> 0:9:31,46
No matter what

286
0:9:31,46 --> 0:9:33,54
You need to have a basic confidence in yourself

287
0:9:33,54 --> 0:9:36,87
Regardless of how the world changes, rises, or falls

288
0:9:36,87 --> 0:9:37,89
Whether it's war or peace

289
0:9:37,89 --> 0:9:39,34
I can survive

290
0:9:39,34 --> 0:9:41,26
I will have a spark of life left

291
0:9:41,26 --> 0:9:42,76
I will surely fight my way through

292
0:9:42,76 --> 0:9:44,48
Think about the Three Kingdoms period

293
0:9:44,48 --> 0:9:45,86
the Three Kingdoms, the Jin Dynasties, and the Southern and Northern Dynasties

294
0:9:45,86 --> 0:9:47,2
the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty

295
0:9:47,2 --> 0:9:49,2
all the way until the Three Kingdoms were unified under the Jin

296
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:50,18
how many years of chaos it was

297
0:9:50,18 --> 0:9:50,58
right?

298
0:9:50,58 --> 0:9:52,8
But does that mean we stop living our lives?

299
0:9:52,8 --> 0:9:53,16
Do we stop having children?

300
0:9:53,16 --> 0:9:54,14
Do we stop eating?

301
0:9:54,14 --> 0:9:54,94
No, of course not.

302
0:9:54,94 --> 0:9:56,3
So, in many cases,

303
0:9:56,3 --> 0:9:58,5
no matter what challenges we face in the future,

304
0:9:58,5 --> 0:10:0,14
there's one principle you must follow:

305
0:10:0,14 --> 0:10:2,41
that is, everyone has a unique purpose and value.

306
0:10:2,41 --> 0:10:3,71
Never lose sight of your lofty aspirations.

307
0:10:3,71 --> 0:10:4,87
Often, we don't have that much wisdom.

308
0:10:4,87 --> 0:10:6,77
We can't see through everything.

309
0:10:6,77 --> 0:10:8,91
We can't predict the future.

310
0:10:8,91 --> 0:10:10,71
We can't solve all our current problems.

311
0:10:10,71 --> 0:10:13,17
No one can do that.

312
0:10:13,17 --> 0:10:14,69
Generally speaking,

313
0:10:14,69 --> 0:10:15,59
many people say we must be able to do it ourselves,

314
0:10:15,59 --> 0:10:17,92
but how confident are we really?

315
0:10:17,92 --> 0:10:20,84
How confident are you really feeling inside?

316
0:10:20,84 --> 0:10:22,3
We need to pay attention to this as well.

317
0:10:22,3 --> 0:10:25,26
So, when it comes to major issues, the country has got us covered.

318
0:10:25,26 --> 0:10:26,18
No need to worry.

319
0:10:26,18 --> 0:10:27,22
We have the most elite professionals.

320
0:10:27,22 --> 0:10:29,6
The smartest and the best are on our side.

321
0:10:29,6 --> 0:10:31,2
We have the top performers from military competitions supporting us.

322
0:10:31,2 --> 0:10:32,48
We have the academic geniuses backing us up.

323
0:10:32,48 --> 0:10:34,4
Don’t worry, the sky won’t fall.

324
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:35,7
Even if it did, the tall ones would hold it up.

325
0:10:35,7 --> 0:10:36,72
Speaking of you

326
0:10:36,72 --> 0:10:37,86
As for me

327
0:10:37,86 --> 0:10:40,47
We just need to make sure we have a good day every day

328
0:10:40,47 --> 0:10:42,84
Living in peace, happiness, and joy is all we need

329
0:10:42,84 --> 0:10:44,68
Like when I go out of town

330
0:10:44,68 --> 0:10:45,92
Now all I want is to come back and see my dad

331
0:10:45,92 --> 0:10:47,12
My mom seeing my child

332
0:10:47,12 --> 0:10:49,14
I feel really secure

333
0:10:49,14 --> 0:10:51,14
When I was in my twenties compared to now in my thirties

334
0:10:51,14 --> 0:10:53,18
It's completely different from what I thought when I was in my forties.

335
0:10:53,18 --> 0:10:53,86
It's totally different.

336
0:10:53,86 --> 0:10:56,86
When I was young, I was eager to prove myself.

337
0:10:56,86 --> 0:10:57,66
But give it a try.

338
0:10:57,66 --> 0:10:59,32
Later on, you look around.

339
0:10:59,32 --> 0:11:1,329
When you try to prove yourself,

340
0:11:1,329 --> 0:11:2,809
you end up failing to do so.

341
0:11:2,809 --> 0:11:5,689
After you've spent a long time accumulating experience in something,

342
0:11:5,689 --> 0:11:7,249
you naturally achieve it.

343
0:11:7,249 --> 0:11:8,39
It happened so quickly

344
0:11:8,39 --> 0:11:11,61
Often, it's because you have too much self-consciousness

345
0:11:11,61 --> 0:11:13,79
You're being too arrogant

346
0:11:13,79 --> 0:11:16,84
Thinking this is the right path

347
0:11:16,84 --> 0:11:19,52
So as you go, you feel less and less confident

348
0:11:19,52 --> 0:11:21,4
You keep looking back

349
0:11:21,4 --> 0:11:22,22
You should be looking forward

350
0:11:22,22 --> 0:11:25,89
Sometimes, you start to lose faith in yourself

351
0:11:25,89 --> 0:11:27,55
And then you become disheartened

352
0:11:27,55 --> 0:11:30,12
Actually, to be honest

353
0:11:30,12 --> 0:11:32,64
the changes in the world don't depend on your material possessions

354
0:11:32,64 --> 0:11:35,38
or your individual will

355
0:11:35,38 --> 0:11:36,52
In many cases

356
0:11:36,52 --> 0:11:38,6
nature follows its own course

357
0:11:38,6 --> 0:11:39,16
So in this context

358
0:11:39,16 --> 0:11:41,91
I believe the most effective way to change ourselves

359
0:11:43,73 --> 0:11:48,37
is not to go around sharing our current insights

360
0:11:48,37 --> 0:11:49,23
The most important thing is

361
0:11:49,23 --> 0:11:51,64
I think that now, the more challenging times we face,

362
0:11:51,64 --> 0:11:54,64
are even more difficult than the present moment.

363
0:11:54,64 --> 0:11:58,44
I believe our only wisdom is to focus on reading books thoroughly.

364
0:11:58,44 --> 0:11:59,8
It's not because I'm about to release a new book,

365
0:11:59,8 --> 0:12:1,4
and I'm telling you to read now.

366
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:4,4
But rather, books offer a state of flow,

367
0:12:4,4 --> 0:12:5,78
a state of calm.

368
0:12:5,78 --> 0:12:7,2
Opening a book,

369
0:12:7,2 --> 0:12:8,6
I recommend reading physical books.

370
0:12:8,6 --> 0:12:9,24
That's right.

371
0:12:9,24 --> 0:12:12,12
Because with e-books, you're always using a smartphone,

372
0:12:12,12 --> 0:12:12,72
or a tablet.

373
0:12:12,72 --> 0:12:15,12
So, you're not really breaking free from electronic devices.

374
0:12:15,12 --> 0:12:16,49
This dependency issue,

375
0:12:16,49 --> 0:12:18,81
or using a computer which consumes a lot of power,

376
0:12:18,81 --> 0:12:21,31
but with a paper book, it can accompany you anywhere,

377
0:12:21,31 --> 0:12:24,7
in any space in the world,

378
0:12:24,7 --> 0:12:26,0
it can even join you in a café.

379
0:12:26,0 --> 0:12:27,32
I'll accompany you to the park

380
0:12:27,32 --> 0:12:28,76
I'll go with you to the airport

381
0:12:28,76 --> 0:12:30,46
Indeed, when it comes to all these things

382
0:12:30,46 --> 0:12:32,84
The more chaotic things get

383
0:12:32,84 --> 0:12:34,4
The more restless people become

384
0:12:34,4 --> 0:12:36,6
You need to maintain absolute inner peace

385
0:12:36,6 --> 0:12:39,17
Success is actually a state of mind

386
0:12:39,17 --> 0:12:41,69
It's a state of mind that comes after putting in the effort

387
0:12:41,69 --> 0:12:43,79
A well-adjusted state of mind

388
0:12:43,79 --> 0:12:45,19
So, no matter what

389
0:12:45,19 --> 0:12:48,319
grasping yourself means grasping your future

390
0:12:48,319 --> 0:12:50,179
no matter how many years it might be

391
0:12:50,179 --> 0:12:51,719
your destiny will change

392
0:12:51,719 --> 0:12:53,2
don't worry

393
0:12:53,2 --> 0:12:54,4
it could be as long as

394
0:12:54,4 --> 0:12:55,54
a couple of decades

395
0:12:55,54 --> 0:12:56,76
or just a few years

396
0:12:56,76 --> 0:12:58,92
or even next week

397
0:12:58,92 --> 0:13:0,61
So, in many cases,

398
0:13:0,61 --> 0:13:2,97
if you were 35 years old,

399
0:13:2,97 --> 0:13:5,24
and at 36, you couldn't see this,

400
0:13:5,24 --> 0:13:6,6
you might have given up on yourself back then,

401
0:13:6,6 --> 0:13:9,12
and you might have missed out on the real outcome,

402
0:13:9,12 --> 0:13:13,2
the true main quest and its storyline,

403
0:13:13,2 --> 0:13:14,66
So what can we do?

404
0:13:14,66 --> 0:13:15,56
How does that saying go?

405
0:13:15,56 --> 0:13:17,92
Patience brings clarity, like clouds parting to reveal the moon.

406
0:13:17,92 --> 0:13:21,2
Sometimes it's like that quote from The Count of Monte Cristo.

407
0:13:21,2 --> 0:13:22,44
More of life's achievements

408
0:13:22,44 --> 0:13:25,819
are made in waiting and hoping.

409
0:13:25,819 --> 0:13:29,299
The less hope there is in a crowd,

410
0:13:29,299 --> 0:13:30,379
the more despair there is,

411
0:13:30,379 --> 0:13:32,26
the better it is for you to rise up.

412
0:13:32,26 --> 0:13:34,42
The less confidence others have,

413
0:13:34,42 --> 0:13:36,92
the more you should gather your own confidence.

414
0:13:36,92 --> 0:13:40,72
The more others act rashly and blindly.

415
0:13:40,72 --> 0:13:42,44
When the market is in panic,

416
0:13:42,44 --> 0:13:45,91
this is actually the time you should really focus on reading.

417
0:13:45,91 --> 0:13:47,33
The National Library isn't far away,

418
0:13:47,33 --> 0:13:49,1
you can ride an electric scooter,

419
0:13:49,1 --> 0:13:49,91
it's just a 10-minute ride,

420
0:13:49,91 --> 0:13:52,66
or a 20-minute trip to the National Library to read some books,

421
0:13:52,66 --> 0:13:53,9
or play the guitar,

422
0:13:53,9 --> 0:13:55,61
or enjoy some PS5 games,

423
0:13:55,61 --> 0:13:56,85
or play on the Xbox.

424
0:13:56,85 --> 0:13:58,27
Play with your Switch a bit

425
0:13:58,27 --> 0:13:59,93
I was thinking about selling my PICO today

426
0:13:59,93 --> 0:14:2,63
I think PICO has brought me a lot of joy

427
0:14:2,63 --> 0:14:3,95
Scroll through your phone

428
0:14:3,95 --> 0:14:6,95
It's okay to take it easy

429
0:14:6,95 --> 0:14:8,19
The big moments in life will come

430
0:14:8,19 --> 0:14:10,16
You're not just waiting for things to happen

431
0:14:10,16 --> 0:14:11,98
Don't be so anxious every day

432
0:14:11,98 --> 0:14:14,78
Being anxious all the time won't solve anything

433
0:14:14,78 --> 0:14:17,79
Let your heart out

434
0:14:17,79 --> 0:14:19,499
Knowing that the great fortune in your destiny will surely come

435
0:14:19,499 --> 0:14:20,719
To wait for that day

436
0:14:20,719 --> 0:14:22,779
To prove that you are not an NPC

437
0:14:22,779 --> 0:14:25,2
It will definitely happen on that day

438
0:14:25,2 --> 0:14:27,8
Originally, I wanted you to see me in my twenties

439
0:14:27,8 --> 0:14:29,55
When I accomplished nothing significant

440
0:14:29,55 --> 0:14:30,61
Right?

441
0:14:30,61 --> 0:14:31,55
Now, in my thirties

442
0:14:31,55 --> 0:14:34,9
It's been the last two or three years, almost 40.

443
0:14:34,9 --> 0:14:35,53
I'm 37 and a half now.

444
0:14:35,53 --> 0:14:37,13
38, 39.

445
0:14:37,13 --> 0:14:39,25
Just the last two and a half years.

446
0:14:39,25 --> 0:14:42,53
Only in the last 25% of the time did I really start to push myself.

447
0:14:42,53 --> 0:14:43,96
Just a little bit.

448
0:14:43,96 --> 0:14:46,72
The so-called effort was just posting a few more videos.

449
0:14:46,72 --> 0:14:48,52
I didn't do much else.

450
0:14:48,52 --> 0:14:49,48
I went out to run a marathon.

451
0:14:49,48 --> 0:14:50,69
Right?

452
0:14:50,69 --> 0:14:51,109
It's not just anything.

453
0:14:51,109 --> 0:14:54,109
Today, we're talking about someone who ranks first in the entire military, not at this level.

454
0:14:54,109 --> 0:14:57,7
It's not like being the top physics student in the whole province either.

455
0:14:57,7 --> 0:14:58,9
That's not the case.

456
0:14:58,9 --> 0:15:0,45
So, a lot of the time, it's about moving at your own pace.

457
0:15:0,45 --> 0:15:2,329
No need to worry too much.

458
0:15:2,329 --> 0:15:4,569
I've lived for quite some time now,

459
0:15:4,569 --> 0:15:5,629
And I've seen a lot.

460
0:15:5,629 --> 0:15:6,289
It's okay

461
0:15:6,289 --> 0:15:7,209
You live longer

462
0:15:7,209 --> 0:15:8,9
You can see further

463
0:15:8,9 --> 0:15:9,3
It's all good

464
0:15:9,3 --> 0:15:12,97
There are certain things you just have to follow the natural laws of development

465
0:15:12,97 --> 0:15:15,5
Because you're just one person in it

466
0:15:15,5 --> 0:15:17,149
But the tide turns

467
0:15:17,149 --> 0:15:17,649
Thirty years

468
0:15:17,649 --> 0:15:18,689
Thirty years on one side, thirty years on the other

469
0:15:18,689 --> 0:15:20,949
You must, must believe in it

470
0:15:20,949 --> 0:15:21,889
Every man is born with a purpose

471
0:15:21,889 --> 0:15:26,8
There will be a time in your life when you will rise to prominence

472
0:15:26,8 --> 0:15:28,4
It's bound to be so

473
0:15:28,4 --> 0:15:29,64
There are times when things are simple for him

474
0:15:29,64 --> 0:15:31,44
Some things make you yield

475
0:15:31,44 --> 0:15:33,18
It's to enhance your abilities

476
0:15:33,18 --> 0:15:34,61
Sharpening the axe doesn't delay the woodcutting

477
0:15:34,61 --> 0:15:36,5
No matter what you're playing now

478
0:15:36,5 --> 0:15:36,91
Romance of the Three Kingdoms

479
0:15:36,91 --> 0:15:39,27
Taking Zhao Yun to find all sorts of beauties

480
0:15:39,27 --> 0:15:41,13
Or when you played Taiko no Nazo

481
0:15:41,13 --> 0:15:42,92
Traveling all over the world

482
0:15:42,92 --> 0:15:44,36
Earning money all over the country

483
0:15:44,36 --> 0:15:45,6
Buying low and selling high

484
0:15:45,6 --> 0:15:48,61
You need to know that all these inspirational games

485
0:15:48,61 --> 0:15:51,29
Will have a period where you need to hone your skills

486
0:15:51,29 --> 0:15:52,55
Sharpen your abilities

487
0:15:52,55 --> 0:15:53,59
Travel and explore

488
0:15:53,59 --> 0:15:56,23
Unlock different chapters of this world

489
0:15:56,23 --> 0:15:57,99
Take a tour of this world

490
0:15:57,99 --> 0:16:0,35
Now is the best time for you to explore this world

491
0:16:0,35 --> 0:16:1,62
As long as you can survive

492
0:16:1,62 --> 0:16:3,68
As long as lying flat still brings in a bit of money

493
0:16:3,68 --> 0:16:4,98
Don't be too anxious

494
0:16:4,98 --> 0:16:6,14
About finding a job

495
0:16:6,14 --> 0:16:6,5
Of course

496
0:16:6,5 --> 0:16:8,14
Let's be honest

497
0:16:8,14 --> 0:16:10,2
If you really have a problem of not being able to eat

498
0:16:10,2 --> 0:16:11,62
If it really comes to that

499
0:16:11,62 --> 0:16:12,72
There's also the minimum living allowance

500
0:16:12,72 --> 0:16:13,46
If you really can't manage

501
0:16:13,46 --> 0:16:15,5
Begging can also help you survive, right?

502
0:16:15,5 --> 0:16:18,59
I can survive as an internet beggar with no problem

503
0:16:18,59 --> 0:16:20,65
Living on a few thousand dollars a month is no issue

504
0:16:20,65 --> 0:16:22,9
It's just not a dignified way to live

505
0:16:22,9 --> 0:16:22,73
You might not have a car

506
0:16:22,73 --> 0:16:23,64
No house

507
0:16:23,64 --> 0:16:25,16
Can't get married right away

508
0:16:25,16 --> 0:16:27,76
Others might think your life is a failure

509
0:16:27,76 --> 0:16:30,28
But look at me

510
0:16:30,28 --> 0:16:32,58
Divorced in middle age

511
0:16:32,58 --> 0:16:33,66
With a child and a cat

512
0:16:33,66 --> 0:16:35,16
Isn't that all there is to being a man?

513
0:16:35,16 --> 0:16:36,58
People will label you

514
0:16:36,58 --> 0:16:37,44
It doesn't matter

515
0:16:37,44 --> 0:16:39,8
As long as you live a contented life

516
0:16:39,8 --> 0:16:42,27
The key is to find peace in your own heart

517
0:16:42,27 --> 0:16:43,87
As long as you're at peace with yourself

518
0:16:43,87 --> 0:16:46,4
This world will be a happy place for you
