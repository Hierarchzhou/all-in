0:0:0,86 --> 0:0:1,58
Hello everyone.

2
0:0:2,62 --> 0:0:4,52
This is my first recording in Shanghai.

3
0:0:4,52 --> 0:0:8,2
I'm currently at a hotel in Pudong, Shanghai.

4
0:0:8,2 --> 0:0:10,26
Why did I choose Pudong?

5
0:0:10,26 --> 0:0:12,2
I'm not sure what made me pick it.

6
0:0:12,2 --> 0:0:14,4
It might have been the price factor.

7
0:0:14,4 --> 0:0:16,98
But the prices weren't really that low.

8
0:0:16,98 --> 0:0:19,78
So tomorrow I might switch to a hotel in Yangpu District.

9
0:0:19,78 --> 0:0:21,62
It's closer to Bilibili.

10
0:0:21,62 --> 0:0:25,34
This time, every time I come to Shanghai, I stay in a different place.

11
0:0:25,34 --> 0:0:27,92
The first time I stayed at Shanghai University.

12
0:0:27,92 --> 0:0:32,1
The second time, I stayed near Tibet Road.

13
0:0:32,1 --> 0:0:35,16
The third time, I stayed in Changning District.

14
0:0:35,16 --> 0:0:37,42
At a hotel in Changning District.

15
0:0:37,42 --> 0:0:42,71
But each time, the purpose of my stay is different.

16
0:0:42,71 --> 0:0:43,63
The purposes are different.

17
0:0:43,63 --> 0:0:45,57
So, the places I stay at are also different.

18
0:0:45,57 --> 0:0:47,56
Now, I feel like I've come here so many times.

19
0:0:47,56 --> 0:0:49,16
What district in Shanghai, what location?

20
0:0:49,16 --> 0:0:50,24
I still can't quite remember.

21
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:54,239
So this time, I suddenly rushed from Hongqiao to Pudong in the middle of the night.

22
0:0:54,239 --> 0:0:56,919
What topic do I want to discuss with everyone in this episode?

23
0:0:56,919 --> 0:0:59,239
It's about Trump's negotiation strategy.

24
0:0:59,239 --> 0:1:1,81
As you know, I'm a big fan of the Old Man Trump.

25
0:1:1,81 --> 0:1:3,33
I've read all of his books.

26
0:1:3,33 --> 0:1:5,5
The Art of the Deal and negotiation.

27
0:1:5,5 --> 0:1:6,77
The most crucial point is

28
0:1:6,77 --> 0:1:9,84
It's actually about Old Bert's art of negotiation.

29
0:1:9,84 --> 0:1:12,2
His negotiation skills are actually quite simple.

30
0:1:12,2 --> 0:1:14,14
Anyone who has studied his autobiography,

31
0:1:14,14 --> 0:1:15,46
can know his negotiation techniques.

32
0:1:15,46 --> 0:1:19,15
It's the so-called Chinese strategy of compromise.

33
0:1:19,15 --> 0:1:20,83
What is the Chinese strategy of compromise?

34
0:1:20,83 --> 0:1:22,99
I remember it was Mr. Lu Xun or someone who said,

35
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:24,7
about the Chinese,

36
0:1:24,7 --> 0:1:26,84
if you were asked to open a window in a room

37
0:1:26,84 --> 0:1:28,18
Most people would try to stop you

38
0:1:28,18 --> 0:1:30,28
But if you say

39
0:1:30,28 --> 0:1:32,33
I want to tear off the roof of this house

40
0:1:32,33 --> 0:1:33,61
Most people would try to prevent you

41
0:1:33,61 --> 0:1:36,73
Then you say, well, can I settle for opening a window instead?

42
0:1:36,73 --> 0:1:37,43
Is that possible?

43
0:1:37,43 --> 0:1:39,93
This is a tactic known as extreme pressure

44
0:1:39,93 --> 0:1:43,52
Because someone makes a very large and unreasonable request

45
0:1:43,52 --> 0:1:44,62
And finds that the other party disagrees

46
0:1:44,62 --> 0:1:45,84
Then, you can settle for less

47
0:1:45,84 --> 0:1:47,18
and others are more likely to agree

48
0:1:47,18 --> 0:1:49,67
Actually, this is the opposite of the foot-in-the-door effect

49
0:1:49,67 --> 0:1:53,37
It's about starting big and then going medium or small

50
0:1:53,37 --> 0:1:56,72
The foot-in-the-door effect is about starting small and then going big

51
0:1:56,72 --> 0:1:57,78
I'll touch you first

52
0:1:57,78 --> 0:1:59,2
You didn't react

53
0:1:59,2 --> 0:1:59,88
I'll kiss your hair

54
0:1:59,88 --> 0:2:0,58
You didn't react

55
0:2:0,58 --> 0:2:1,68
You didn’t react.

56
0:2:1,68 --> 0:2:3,8
Then you can be more vocal.

57
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:5,64
Then you can get handsy.

58
0:2:5,64 --> 0:2:7,84
This is the foot-in-the-door effect.

59
0:2:7,84 --> 0:2:9,72
Then they gradually test your boundaries.

60
0:2:9,72 --> 0:2:10,829
This is about testing others.

61
0:2:10,829 --> 0:2:12,789
If we’re talking about negotiation tactics,

62
0:2:12,789 --> 0:2:14,21
it’s about exaggerating first,

63
0:2:14,21 --> 0:2:16,69
starting with a price that the other party will definitely reject.

64
0:2:16,69 --> 0:2:17,85
And then pay it off bit by bit.

65
0:2:17,85 --> 0:2:20,13
This is actually a strategy we often see.

66
0:2:20,13 --> 0:2:23,4
But in the lab, there's no one like Trump who talks like that.

67
0:2:23,4 --> 0:2:24,36
So unreasonable.

68
0:2:24,36 --> 0:2:26,88
Or the things he does are quite out of line.

69
0:2:26,88 --> 0:2:27,94
It's precisely because they're out of line.

70
0:2:27,94 --> 0:2:29,47
That he became famous.

71
0:2:29,47 --> 0:2:32,63
Just like Lei Jun's sales strategy.

72
0:2:32,63 --> 0:2:35,53
Didn't Apple say they won't be including chargers anymore?

73
0:2:35,53 --> 0:2:37,67
We also announce that we won't be preparing chargers.

74
0:2:37,67 --> 0:2:40,9
Then we got really slammed for it.

75
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:41,94
How could Xiaomi do this?

76
0:2:41,94 --> 0:2:43,3
But when it was actually released,

77
0:2:43,3 --> 0:2:46,24
You'll notice the version that doesn't come with a charger

78
0:2:46,24 --> 0:2:49,69
It's only one dollar cheaper than the version that comes with a charger.

79
0:2:49,69 --> 0:2:52,33
That means you can get Xiaomi's power-up for just one yuan.

80
0:2:52,33 --> 0:2:53,45
It's almost like you didn't spend any money at all.

81
0:2:53,45 --> 0:2:54,47
It's as if it's still being given away for free.

82
0:2:54,47 --> 0:2:57,25
So this approach successfully marketed the brand.

83
0:2:57,25 --> 0:3:0,13
There's also the point that he spent 2 million to change the logo,

84
0:3:0,13 --> 0:3:1,17
which essentially looked the same as before.

85
0:3:1,17 --> 0:3:2,55
Then everyone mocked him for being foolish,

86
0:3:2,55 --> 0:3:5,17
but in reality, this move was all about generating traffic and buzz.

87
0:3:5,17 --> 0:3:7,73
So in many cases, including when I sued the Xicheng Dama,

88
0:3:7,73 --> 0:3:9,37
and in many other situations,

89
0:3:9,37 --> 0:3:11,9
the actual intention is not what it seems on the surface.

90
0:3:11,9 --> 0:3:13,3
It's just a facade.

91
0:3:13,3 --> 0:3:14,83
Trump is planning to attack Canada

92
0:3:14,83 --> 0:3:16,71
He's aiming to invade Panama, right?

93
0:3:16,71 --> 0:3:18,79
Actually, his target is Greenland

94
0:3:18,79 --> 0:3:21,18
He started by marking three locations

95
0:3:21,18 --> 0:3:24,82
These people would then have to make concessions to prevent the attacks

96
0:3:24,82 --> 0:3:25,46
That's how it goes

97
0:3:25,46 --> 0:3:26,94
So this is a form of blackmail

98
0:3:26,94 --> 0:3:30,1
Distortion can also be seen as a form of extortion

99
0:3:30,1 --> 0:3:31,34
But to put it another way

100
0:3:31,34 --> 0:3:35,24
While states may have international law between them,

101
0:3:35,24 --> 0:3:37,76
in reality, it has no enforcement power.

102
0:3:37,76 --> 0:3:40,16
It is essentially just a diplomatic tool of power and influence.

103
0:3:40,16 --> 0:3:43,34
So, if you are already the dominant force in a region,

104
0:3:43,34 --> 0:3:46,48
you are in a position of authority,

105
0:3:46,48 --> 0:3:47,72
once you have the power in your hands,

106
0:3:47,72 --> 0:3:48,7
you can issue orders and make decisions.

107
0:3:48,7 --> 0:3:50,14
If you don’t take action,

108
0:3:50,14 --> 0:3:52,6
then you’ve wasted the power you’ve been given.

109
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:54,7
So he has to apply maximum pressure

110
0:3:54,7 --> 0:3:55,95
play this thing like a hand of cards

111
0:3:55,95 --> 0:3:58,759
and then sort out the sequencing

112
0:3:58,759 --> 0:4:0,299
it's like playing mahjong

113
0:4:0,299 --> 0:4:1,339
if your tiles aren't good

114
0:4:1,339 --> 0:4:2,19
you stay in the game

115
0:4:2,19 --> 0:4:3,979
or you can push the mahjong tiles away

116
0:4:3,979 --> 0:4:6,39
it's the same with playing Dou Dizhu

117
0:4:6,39 --> 0:4:7,27
you just don't bid

118
0:4:7,27 --> 0:4:9,71
If none of the three call it, they draw cards again.

119
0:4:9,71 --> 0:4:11,69
Whenever it’s not in their favor, they draw cards again.

120
0:4:11,69 --> 0:4:14,49
So I think his ultimate goal might not be to attack Panama.

121
0:4:14,49 --> 0:4:16,11
It’s not about the attack itself, right?

122
0:4:16,11 --> 0:4:17,1
Attacking Canada, for instance.

123
0:4:17,1 --> 0:4:20,63
Because everyone knows that if a war is to break out,

124
0:4:20,63 --> 0:4:22,19
preparations for war must be made first.

125
0:4:22,19 --> 0:4:23,91
And these preparations require a lot of resources and manpower.

126
0:4:23,91 --> 0:4:26,62
A lot of resources and manpower must be mobilized and prepared.

127
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:27,54
Otherwise, you see,

128
0:4:27,54 --> 0:4:29,32
especially in modern warfare,

129
0:4:29,32 --> 0:4:32,85
the main things to allocate are resources and all sorts of plans,

130
0:4:32,85 --> 0:4:34,89
which need to be meticulously organized.

131
0:4:34,89 --> 0:4:37,25
If you've read Carl von Clausewitz's On War,

132
0:4:37,25 --> 0:4:40,719
you'll know that even from the wars of Napoleon's era in the 18th century,

133
0:4:40,719 --> 0:4:42,719
things were already quite complex,

134
0:4:42,719 --> 0:4:43,439
logistics,

135
0:4:43,439 --> 0:4:44,539
military logistics.

136
0:4:44,539 --> 0:4:46,339
When it comes to military finance and economics

137
0:4:46,339 --> 0:4:49,99
why are they mentioned alongside campaign studies and command studies?

138
0:4:49,99 --> 0:4:50,139
When viewed from the same perspective,

139
0:4:50,139 --> 0:4:53,15
it's because modern warfare is becoming increasingly complex.

140
0:4:53,15 --> 0:4:54,51
For example, when we talk about deploying artillery,

141
0:4:54,51 --> 0:4:57,319
you have to consider the weight of the artillery itself,

142
0:4:57,319 --> 0:4:58,499
the ammunition supply for the artillery,

143
0:4:58,499 --> 0:5:0,719
all the preparatory work required for the artillery operations,

144
0:5:0,719 --> 0:5:1,979
if you want to use such weapons

145
0:5:1,979 --> 0:5:4,419
You need to provide the necessary conditions for this weapon.

146
0:5:5,41 --> 0:5:8,87
So, how do we coordinate the supply of nutrients?

147
0:5:8,87 --> 0:5:10,49
Such as fuel and all kinds of supplies.

148
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:12,6
When talking about World War II,

149
0:5:12,6 --> 0:5:13,76
Aircraft and tanks required fuel.

150
0:5:13,76 --> 0:5:14,62
In many cases,

151
0:5:14,62 --> 0:5:16,66
We can look at the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine this year.

152
0:5:16,66 --> 0:5:18,7
But this has been going on for several years.

153
0:5:18,7 --> 0:5:19,91
Frequently due to tanks running out of fuel.

154
0:5:19,91 --> 0:5:21,43
There was no resupply of ammunition.

155
0:5:21,43 --> 0:5:22,51
So, problems arose.

156
0:5:22,51 --> 0:5:25,5
That's why the logistics capability in modern warfare is crucial.

157
0:5:25,5 --> 0:5:27,21
And the organization of such logistics.

158
0:5:27,21 --> 0:5:28,49
After being attacked, then what?

159
0:5:28,49 --> 0:5:30,17
There's a need for the ability to replenish.

160
0:5:30,17 --> 0:5:31,87
As the saying goes, 'Xiao He manages the logistics behind the scenes'.

161
0:5:31,87 --> 0:5:33,87
Xiao He's role is absolutely vital.

162
0:5:33,87 --> 0:5:35,43
Deciding which areas need reinforcements

163
0:5:35,43 --> 0:5:36,63
Which location needs additional weapons

164
0:5:36,63 --> 0:5:39,37
Where should we take action

165
0:5:39,37 --> 0:5:40,25
Replenish supplies

166
0:5:40,25 --> 0:5:42,659
And in reality

167
0:5:42,659 --> 0:5:44,139
There are time lags

168
0:5:44,139 --> 0:5:45,379
You respond here

169
0:5:45,379 --> 0:5:47,699
But they might not react in time, and new situations could arise

170
0:5:47,699 --> 0:5:50,5
So your intelligence network must communicate very smoothly

171
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:53,42
That's why, when it comes to Trump's strategies

172
0:5:53,42 --> 0:5:54,72
Actually, it's a bit unreliable

173
0:5:54,72 --> 0:5:56,47
But for most people

174
0:5:56,47 --> 0:5:58,29
To guard against such unreliability

175
0:5:58,29 --> 0:6:0,43
More preparation is needed

176
0:6:0,43 --> 0:6:1,43
In this case

177
0:6:1,43 --> 0:6:3,95
He only needs to send out a tweet

178
0:6:3,95 --> 0:6:6,31
Others have to make three or four steps of preparation

179
0:6:6,31 --> 0:6:8,43
This way, he gains the upper hand

180
0:6:8,43 --> 0:6:11,11
And after a series of such moves

181
0:6:11,11 --> 0:6:13,9
He can influence the stock market

182
0:6:13,9 --> 0:6:16,5
and have a new impact on financial markets across the country and the world

183
0:6:16,5 --> 0:6:18,66
and when he speaks in this way

184
0:6:18,66 --> 0:6:20,86
it inadvertently makes these arms manufacturers

185
0:6:20,86 --> 0:6:24,2
these large military-industrial complexes, quite pleased and happy

186
0:6:24,2 --> 0:6:25,59
So in many cases

187
0:6:25,59 --> 0:6:28,1
how does he motivate people

188
0:6:28,1 --> 0:6:30,15
think about it, if a war really starts

189
0:6:30,15 --> 0:6:30,63
right?

190
0:6:30,63 --> 0:6:33,12
Those from Lanzhou, especially those in Washington State,

191
0:6:33,12 --> 0:6:35,6
would they have to flee to places that are not border areas?

192
0:6:35,6 --> 0:6:36,76
So in many cases,

193
0:6:36,76 --> 0:6:39,2
many things in reality are in its favor.

194
0:6:39,2 --> 0:6:40,56
This wildfire in California,

195
0:6:40,56 --> 0:6:43,64
if he were to prepare for a full-scale conflict with Canada,

196
0:6:43,64 --> 0:6:44,68
then to be honest, the northeastern parts of the U.S., those Lanzhou areas,

197
0:6:44,68 --> 0:6:47,66
including the northwestern parts of those Lanzhou areas,

198
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:52,13
The central part, in fact, is the non-rainy belt of the United States.

199
0:6:52,13 --> 0:6:53,93
Many areas in the central region,

200
0:6:53,93 --> 0:6:56,5
can be said to suffer less,

201
0:6:56,5 --> 0:6:57,57
Tennessee, for instance, doesn't suffer as much, right?

202
0:6:57,57 --> 0:7:0,81
But Washington and the northeastern states,

203
0:7:0,81 --> 0:7:1,71
that's not necessarily the case.

204
0:7:1,71 --> 0:7:5,62
So a lot of things are such that when you do one thing,

205
0:7:5,62 --> 0:7:7,66
it can trigger several reactions from the other side,

206
0:7:7,66 --> 0:7:8,68
just like playing Go.

207
0:7:8,68 --> 0:7:10,33
Just like when you play Go

208
0:7:10,33 --> 0:7:11,73
Just like when you play chess

209
0:7:11,73 --> 0:7:13,49
If you can move one piece

210
0:7:13,49 --> 0:7:17,469
It can cause several of the opponent's pieces to react accordingly

211
0:7:17,469 --> 0:7:18,29
To put it this way

212
0:7:18,29 --> 0:7:19,98
This is the ultimate strategy

213
0:7:19,98 --> 0:7:22,38
So in many cases, I think

214
0:7:22,38 --> 0:7:23,42
When it comes to biographies of celebrities

215
0:7:23,42 --> 0:7:24,58
I generally don't like to read them

216
0:7:24,58 --> 0:7:28,419
Because celebrity biographies are often filled with narcissistic tendencies and personal interpretations.

217
0:7:28,659 --> 0:7:30,859
But the books about Trump

218
0:7:30,859 --> 0:7:33,34
Especially 'The Art of the Deal' which was written in the 1970s and 1980s

219
0:7:33,34 --> 0:7:34,5
His books, before he became president

220
0:7:34,5 --> 0:7:35,86
He had already written them

221
0:7:35,86 --> 0:7:37,42
So a lot of things

222
0:7:37,42 --> 0:7:38,42
You can see that Trump really has some remarkable qualities

223
0:7:38,42 --> 0:7:41,37
He gets a lot of attention

224
0:7:41,37 --> 0:7:42,41
A lot of attention

225
0:7:42,41 --> 0:7:43,99
In areas he doesn't understand

226
0:7:43,99 --> 0:7:46,65
He is definitely unreliable

227
0:7:46,65 --> 0:7:47,84
But in areas where he excels

228
0:7:47,84 --> 0:7:51,98
Especially in distortion

229
0:7:51,98 --> 0:7:53,72
And extortion techniques

230
0:7:53,72 --> 0:7:55,3
These skills are indeed worth mastering

231
0:7:55,3 --> 0:7:57,53
Many times

232
0:7:57,53 --> 0:7:58,67
The more closed off you are

233
0:7:58,67 --> 0:7:59,92
The more you will be valued

234
0:7:59,92 --> 0:8:1,28
So I highly recommend that everyone

235
0:8:1,28 --> 0:8:3,64
Read Trump's autobiographies as soon as possible
