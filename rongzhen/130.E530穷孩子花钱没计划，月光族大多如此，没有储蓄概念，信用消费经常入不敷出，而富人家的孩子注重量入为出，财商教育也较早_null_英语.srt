1
0:0:0,64 --> 0:0:2,8
I can't remember which episode this is

2
0:0:2,8 --> 0:0:3,1
but let's start today

3
0:0:3,1 --> 0:0:6,96
Yesterday, I didn't go live on that platform.

4
0:0:6,96 --> 0:0:9,82
because I was really sick

5
0:0:9,82 --> 0:0:10,9
I had a high fever

6
0:0:10,9 --> 0:0:12,56
so I didn't update yesterday

7
0:0:12,56 --> 0:0:13,88
so today we're back with an update

8
0:0:13,88 --> 0:0:16,6
today I'm going to talk about a very simple issue

9
0:0:16,6 --> 0:0:18,56
which is whether it's the poor kids who spend more money

10
0:0:18,56 --> 0:0:20,9
Kids from wealthy families do spend more money.

11
0:0:20,9 --> 0:0:24,42
We tend to use extreme examples each time.

12
0:0:24,42 --> 0:0:26,9
My college classmates also say I study computer science

13
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:29,29
That was a second-tier university.

14
0:0:29,29 --> 0:0:31,17
Many of my college classmates

15
0:0:31,17 --> 0:0:32,41
90% of them,

16
0:0:32,41 --> 0:0:35,25
were from rural areas around Beijing.

17
0:0:35,25 --> 0:0:36,9
What do we mean by rural areas?

18
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:38,3
We're talking about the outskirts, like Shunyi.

19
0:0:38,3 --> 0:0:39,8
Pinggu

20
0:0:39,8 --> 0:0:40,26
Huairou

21
0:0:40,26 --> 0:0:41,14
Yanqing

22
0:0:41,14 --> 0:0:41,94
Daxing

23
0:0:41,94 --> 0:0:43,2
places like these

24
0:0:43,2 --> 0:0:44,47
and Tongzhou as well

25
0:0:44,47 --> 0:0:47,7
back then, when our classmates spoke

26
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:48,57
they were all quite down-to-earth

27
0:0:48,57 --> 0:0:50,6
how should I put it

28
0:0:50,6 --> 0:0:51,52
Well, you can't exactly call it crude.

29
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:53,26
But it's truly very simple and honest.

30
0:0:53,26 --> 0:0:56,89
But the tactics in the countryside are different from those in the city.

31
0:0:56,89 --> 0:1:0,5
My classmates left a deep impression on me.

32
0:1:0,5 --> 0:1:3,72
Because from elementary school to junior high school,

33
0:1:3,72 --> 0:1:4,26
and even high school,

34
0:1:4,26 --> 0:1:5,64
I mostly interacted with people from Beijing,

35
0:1:5,64 --> 0:1:6,56
kids from the city,

36
0:1:6,56 --> 0:1:7,9
and rarely with those from the suburbs.

37
0:1:7,9 --> 0:1:10,16
Kids from the so-called outskirts

38
0:1:11,8 --> 0:1:13,44
Rarely interact with children from rural areas

39
0:1:13,44 --> 0:1:15,64
So back then, I realized that between people

40
0:1:15,64 --> 0:1:19,21
These thought patterns and habits were actually quite

41
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:20,47
Very different

42
0:1:20,47 --> 0:1:23,43
Was it 2004 or 2005? Everyone remember

43
0:1:23,43 --> 0:1:24,75
I can't recall exactly

44
0:1:24,75 --> 0:1:26,25
But it wasn't during our freshman year

45
0:1:26,25 --> 0:1:29,41
Our whole class rented a car to go to Shidu for a trip

46
0:1:29,41 --> 0:1:31,29
Why did the school suddenly organize a spring outing?

47
0:1:31,29 --> 0:1:32,69
At that time, our school

48
0:1:32,69 --> 0:1:36,1
was concerned about the collision incident between the Chinese and Japanese ships

49
0:1:36,1 --> 0:1:38,53
You know, the ship captain, what was his name again?

50
0:1:38,53 --> 0:1:41,4
That captain collided with a Japanese Coast Guard vessel

51
0:1:41,4 --> 0:1:42,82
During that period

52
0:1:42,82 --> 0:1:46,1
there were many mass movements

53
0:1:46,1 --> 0:1:46,68
You know?

54
0:1:46,68 --> 0:1:49,88
So the school was worried about these college students

55
0:1:49,88 --> 0:1:51,62
Not that particularly restless

56
0:1:51,62 --> 0:1:54,1
So they arranged for each class to go out and play

57
0:1:54,1 --> 0:1:56,66
You know, back then there were a lot of guys in the Computer Science department

58
0:1:56,66 --> 0:1:58,18
We were worried about you getting into trouble

59
0:1:58,18 --> 0:2:0,6
So they arranged for you to visit places around Beijing

60
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:2,16
We went to Shidu

61
0:2:2,16 --> 0:2:6,1
Shidu, the Du in Shidu means ferry

62
0:2:6,1 --> 0:2:7,65
Shidu is a really beautiful place

63
0:2:7,65 --> 0:2:8,65
It has mountains and rivers

64
0:2:8,65 --> 0:2:9,23
There's something to do

65
0:2:9,23 --> 0:2:11,21
When we went there that time

66
0:2:11,21 --> 0:2:14,54
I'm talking about those famous ghost stories

67
0:2:14,54 --> 0:2:16,42
I suddenly flipped my car on the highway

68
0:2:16,42 --> 0:2:18,54
That was one of them

69
0:2:18,54 --> 0:2:19,88
It went like this on the road

70
0:2:19,88 --> 0:2:22,52
What left a deep impression on me was

71
0:2:22,52 --> 0:2:24,72
We had a great time that day

72
0:2:24,72 --> 0:2:28,73
But it made me realize the differences among children from different backgrounds

73
0:2:28,73 --> 0:2:31,23
The concept of money is completely different.

74
0:2:31,23 --> 0:2:33,9
Of course, everyone has been taught about it.

75
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:34,8
Money for fun.

76
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:38,36
And because they spend without much restraint,

77
0:2:38,36 --> 0:2:39,36
without much thought,

78
0:2:39,36 --> 0:2:41,7
when everyone’s money is pooled together,

79
0:2:41,7 --> 0:2:42,6
it seems like a lot of money,

80
0:2:42,6 --> 0:2:43,58
so they go all out spending it.

81
0:2:43,58 --> 0:2:45,54
On the first day, I ordered a whole roasted lamb.

82
0:2:45,54 --> 0:2:46,76
We had three whole roasted lambs.

83
0:2:46,76 --> 0:2:48,58
You know, a whole roasted lamb is quite expensive.

84
0:2:48,58 --> 0:2:50,0
Even if you're really happy,

85
0:2:50,0 --> 0:2:52,33
once you start drinking, things get pricey.

86
0:2:52,33 --> 0:2:54,81
They have their own little circle, you see.

87
0:2:54,81 --> 0:2:56,17
They're all classmates.

88
0:2:56,17 --> 0:2:58,53
But every class definitely has its own little circle, right?

89
0:2:58,53 --> 0:2:59,89
Those few people are especially close.

90
0:2:59,89 --> 0:3:2,3
So these people are good friends with the class president.

91
0:3:2,3 --> 0:3:4,31
He took care of everything.

92
0:3:4,31 --> 0:3:5,11
How much are we spending?

93
0:3:5,11 --> 0:3:6,17
It's up to us.

94
0:3:6,17 --> 0:3:7,29
But I can understand that.

95
0:3:7,29 --> 0:3:8,35
Every village has its bully.

96
0:3:8,35 --> 0:3:9,28
It's quite normal.

97
0:3:9,28 --> 0:3:11,24
But then a problem arose.

98
0:3:11,24 --> 0:3:12,72
When we went out to play the next day,

99
0:3:12,72 --> 0:3:14,61
we found that the money wasn't enough.

100
0:3:14,61 --> 0:3:15,69
We're short on cash.

101
0:3:15,69 --> 0:3:17,41
In fact, it's not even enough.

102
0:3:17,41 --> 0:3:20,29
We couldn't even afford lunch.

103
0:3:20,29 --> 0:3:21,81
But at that time,

104
0:3:21,81 --> 0:3:24,35
Well, everyone is unsure about what to do.

105
0:3:24,35 --> 0:3:27,51
We were all sitting under the sun,

106
0:3:27,51 --> 0:3:29,5
on a stone bench,

107
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:32,64
and we sat there for about two hours,

108
0:3:32,64 --> 0:3:34,26
I'm not exaggerating.

109
0:3:34,26 --> 0:3:35,42
I sat there for two hours

110
0:3:35,42 --> 0:3:37,2
and I was really puzzled

111
0:3:37,2 --> 0:3:39,9
I said, what have you been waiting for these two hours?

112
0:3:39,9 --> 0:3:40,66
What have you been waiting for?

113
0:3:40,66 --> 0:3:42,91
No solution was proposed either

114
0:3:42,91 --> 0:3:44,51
Then I figured it out

115
0:3:44,51 --> 0:3:46,85
The remaining money was clearly not enough

116
0:3:46,85 --> 0:3:48,92
It wasn’t enough for everyone to spend

117
0:3:48,92 --> 0:3:52,98
But if only half the people were allowed to

118
0:3:52,98 --> 0:3:54,64
Leaving this group,

119
0:3:54,64 --> 0:3:57,72
then the remaining people can not only eat but also have fun.

120
0:3:57,72 --> 0:3:58,12
You know?

121
0:3:58,12 --> 0:3:59,48
Later, I became more cautious.

122
0:3:59,48 --> 0:4:1,16
I said to their leader,

123
0:4:1,16 --> 0:4:2,48
I said, if it really doesn't work,

124
0:4:2,48 --> 0:4:3,12
Who's hungry?

125
0:4:3,12 --> 0:4:4,32
I'll take them to get some food first.

126
0:4:4,32 --> 0:4:5,0
Oh, sorry.

127
0:4:5,0 --> 0:4:7,36
If everyone still has some money, they can spend it themselves.

128
0:4:7,36 --> 0:4:9,16
But if we spend more, might the class fund run short?

129
0:4:9,16 --> 0:4:10,36
They also showed signs of discomfort.

130
0:4:10,36 --> 0:4:11,96
But they don’t communicate with you either.

131
0:4:11,96 --> 0:4:12,9
It’s just so funny.

132
0:4:12,9 --> 0:4:15,7
That’s just how it is.

133
0:4:15,7 --> 0:4:17,35
You can see his face changing colors.

134
0:4:17,35 --> 0:4:18,59
But these people are just so funny.

135
0:4:18,59 --> 0:4:21,7
It’s like, how do you even explain it?

136
0:4:21,7 --> 0:4:21,95
They're bullies who pretend to be polite

137
0:4:21,95 --> 0:4:24,109
Yeah, they act tough but aren't really righteous

138
0:4:24,109 --> 0:4:26,549
On the surface, they seem very loyal

139
0:4:26,549 --> 0:4:27,709
They talk nicely most of the time

140
0:4:27,709 --> 0:4:30,269
But when it counts, they have their own little schemes

141
0:4:30,269 --> 0:4:30,709
You know what I mean

142
0:4:30,709 --> 0:4:33,29
So later, I brought a few people along

143
0:4:33,29 --> 0:4:34,9
No, no

144
0:4:34,9 --> 0:4:35,23
Actually, they're not from our class

145
0:4:35,23 --> 0:4:39,21
I took those who had strong opinions out for a meal.

146
0:4:39,21 --> 0:4:41,25
We chatted casually about the restaurant and such.

147
0:4:41,25 --> 0:4:42,97
After all, the money wasn't really enough.

148
0:4:42,97 --> 0:4:45,62
So I talked to the owner of the restaurant.

149
0:4:45,62 --> 0:4:47,46
It was around one or two in the afternoon, you see.

150
0:4:47,46 --> 0:4:48,9
By then, we were past the point of being hungry.

151
0:4:48,9 --> 0:4:50,38
And the restaurant was about to close.

152
0:4:50,38 --> 0:4:53,79
I specifically chose a place that wasn't doing too well in terms of business.

153
0:4:53,79 --> 0:4:55,75
Then they brought out a lot of food.

154
0:4:55,75 --> 0:4:56,35
stuff like vegetables

155
0:4:56,35 --> 0:4:58,31
made us devour the food like wolves

156
0:4:58,31 --> 0:4:58,91
we hadn’t had breakfast

157
0:4:58,91 --> 0:4:59,51
or lunch either

158
0:4:59,51 --> 0:5:0,31
since we had been hiking as well

159
0:5:0,31 --> 0:5:0,95
and were completely exhausted

160
0:5:0,95 --> 0:5:1,87
so we all gobbled up the food

161
0:5:1,87 --> 0:5:2,81
finally, we were full

162
0:5:2,81 --> 0:5:4,41
there were probably seven or eight of us

163
0:5:4,41 --> 0:5:6,21
The rest of them were really happy

164
0:5:6,21 --> 0:5:7,49
I took this group away

165
0:5:7,49 --> 0:5:8,31
The remaining folks

166
0:5:8,31 --> 0:5:9,42
We had enough money

167
0:5:9,42 --> 0:5:10,66
Rushed off to go rafting

168
0:5:10,66 --> 0:5:11,8
After rafting, we had a meal

169
0:5:11,8 --> 0:5:14,4
Everyone was in high spirits that day

170
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:16,82
And we took the hard-seat train back to Beijing

171
0:5:16,82 --> 0:5:18,84
That experience left a profound impression on me

172
0:5:18,84 --> 0:5:21,96
We're talking about kids from poor families.

173
0:5:21,96 --> 0:5:23,72
We shouldn't generalize about the poor and the rich.

174
0:5:23,72 --> 0:5:24,72
To be honest,

175
0:5:24,72 --> 0:5:25,62
Let's be frank,

176
0:5:25,62 --> 0:5:28,36
Most of the people affected by urban redevelopment are farmers from the outskirts of Beijing.

177
0:5:28,36 --> 0:5:30,24
We can't absolutely categorize people as poor or rich.

178
0:5:30,24 --> 0:5:32,48
But being poor or rich is more about mindset.

179
0:5:32,48 --> 0:5:33,12
It's all about the mindset.

180
0:5:33,12 --> 0:5:34,6
Like when I was six years old,

181
0:5:34,6 --> 0:5:36,8
Since I grew up in Zhongguancun

182
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:37,28
When I found Zhongguancun

183
0:5:37,28 --> 0:5:37,8
As you all know

184
0:5:37,8 --> 0:5:39,88
If you've been to the northeast of Peking University

185
0:5:39,88 --> 0:5:42,0
That's the side with the subway station

186
0:5:42,0 --> 0:5:44,34
Then head to the east side of this road

187
0:5:44,34 --> 0:5:46,2
You'll reach Zhongguancun No. 2 Primary School

188
0:5:48,15 --> 0:5:49,89
Then walk a bit further north

189
0:5:49,89 --> 0:5:50,85
Isn't there a bakery?

190
0:5:50,85 --> 0:5:51,73
Head a bit further north

191
0:5:51,73 --> 0:5:54,63
and you'll find a small road leading into the Keyuan community

192
0:5:54,63 --> 0:5:56,19
where my grandparents live

193
0:5:56,19 --> 0:5:58,91
This Keyuan community actually has a particularly rough road

194
0:5:58,91 --> 0:6:0,55
but this particularly rough road

195
0:6:0,55 --> 0:6:4,31
was the site of the first New Oriental campus back in the day

196
0:6:4,31 --> 0:6:8,4
This site was located here in the early 1990s

197
0:6:8,4 --> 0:6:10,58
and there was a rural credit cooperative here

198
0:6:10,58 --> 0:6:13,17
I'm not sure if it was a city or rural credit cooperative

199
0:6:13,17 --> 0:6:14,89
It was just a tiny savings office.

200
0:6:14,89 --> 0:6:16,47
I remember going to this savings office.

201
0:6:16,47 --> 0:6:17,65
It left a particularly strong impression on me.

202
0:6:17,65 --> 0:6:19,28
My mom opened a passbook account for me.

203
0:6:19,28 --> 0:6:21,5
I was in fourth or fifth grade back then.

204
0:6:21,5 --> 0:6:22,94
I deposited 60 yuan.

205
0:6:22,94 --> 0:6:25,86
I got my first bank card when I was in the first year of junior high school.

206
0:6:25,86 --> 0:6:27,6
My first credit card

207
0:6:27,6 --> 0:6:29,4
I received when I was in my first year of high school.

208
0:6:29,4 --> 0:6:30,74
Don't think this is weird.

209
0:6:30,74 --> 0:6:33,2
You need to understand this.

210
0:6:33,2 --> 0:6:33,62
Exactly.

211
0:6:33,62 --> 0:6:35,2
Of course, it's a supplementary credit card.

212
0:6:35,2 --> 0:6:38,73
It was for playing games across borders back then.

213
0:6:38,73 --> 0:6:40,35
I had my mom apply for a dual-currency card.

214
0:6:40,35 --> 0:6:42,31
Then I got a supplementary card.

215
0:6:42,31 --> 0:6:43,67
Don't think this is strange.

216
0:6:43,67 --> 0:6:45,63
Now, what do you need a bank card for?

217
0:6:45,63 --> 0:6:47,35
Going back to my time,

218
0:6:47,35 --> 0:6:49,76
My first year of junior high was in 1997.

219
0:6:49,76 --> 0:6:51,64
In 1997, we only had magnetic stripe cards.

220
0:6:51,64 --> 0:6:53,36
The first card I got was from the Construction Bank.

221
0:6:53,36 --> 0:6:55,4
Later on, I got a card from China Merchants Bank.

222
0:6:55,4 --> 0:6:56,22
A credit card from China Merchants Bank.

223
0:6:56,22 --> 0:6:58,26
Back then, in 1997 and 1999,

224
0:6:58,26 --> 0:7:0,0
that was quite a while ago.

225
0:7:0,0 --> 0:7:3,2
At that time, there wasn't much of an internet concept like we have now.

226
0:7:3,2 --> 0:7:4,88
The internet was just getting started

227
0:7:4,88 --> 0:7:6,1
At the beginning, there was 163

228
0:7:6,1 --> 0:7:8,35
169 dial-up, 263, and those kinds of services

229
0:7:8,35 --> 0:7:10,43
So it was a very, very early period

230
0:7:10,43 --> 0:7:12,3
That is to say, it only started from that time

231
0:7:12,3 --> 0:7:15,9
Actually, every time my mom and dad talk to me, they say this

232
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:16,97
They started giving me money right from the beginning

233
0:7:16,97 --> 0:7:19,73
Many parents handle things differently with their kids

234
0:7:19,73 --> 0:7:22,12
It's about what expenses students should have

235
0:7:22,12 --> 0:7:24,0
Kids ask for money whenever they want something.

236
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:26,52
And when they can't afford something,

237
0:7:26,52 --> 0:7:28,2
they get upset if their parents don't buy it for them.

238
0:7:28,2 --> 0:7:29,44
But my parents were never like that.

239
0:7:29,44 --> 0:7:31,4
Instead, they encouraged me to save money.

240
0:7:31,4 --> 0:7:32,12
They encouraged me to save.

241
0:7:32,12 --> 0:7:35,37
And every month, they would give me a fixed amount of about six or seven hundred yuan.

242
0:7:35,37 --> 0:7:36,9
They would give me about six or seven hundred yuan.

243
0:7:36,9 --> 0:7:37,77
Back then, that was quite a lot of money.

244
0:7:37,77 --> 0:7:39,9
Back in high school, they would give around six or seven hundred yuan.

245
0:7:39,9 --> 0:7:40,66
So, you see,

246
0:7:40,66 --> 0:7:41,8
two people would get 1,400 yuan.

247
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:43,46
Then, we would keep this money,

248
0:7:43,46 --> 0:7:45,26
if you saved it,

249
0:7:45,26 --> 0:7:47,8
if you saved 5,000 to 10,000 yuan,

250
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:48,36
they would give you an extra 1,000 yuan.

251
0:7:48,36 --> 0:7:49,48
My parents often encouraged me,

252
0:7:49,48 --> 0:7:50,4
you know.

253
0:7:50,4 --> 0:7:51,64
So, you should try to spend less.

254
0:7:51,64 --> 0:7:52,92
You should try to minimize your expenses.

255
0:7:52,92 --> 0:7:58,51
So, by the time I went to college or university,

256
0:7:58,51 --> 0:7:59,55
before studying abroad,

257
0:7:59,55 --> 0:8:1,3
I had saved up about 100,000 yuan.

258
0:8:1,3 --> 0:8:2,35
I worked part-time jobs,

259
0:8:2,35 --> 0:8:3,11
sold items,

260
0:8:3,11 --> 0:8:5,15
and collected red envelopes,

261
0:8:5,15 --> 0:8:7,789
and saved my pocket money.

262
0:8:8,109 --> 0:8:10,72
Many parents don't give their kids money

263
0:8:10,72 --> 0:8:12,12
They only start giving money once the kids go to college

264
0:8:12,12 --> 0:8:14,38
Or they might give a little if the kids are boarding

265
0:8:14,38 --> 0:8:16,4
Or they just don't want you to worry about money

266
0:8:16,4 --> 0:8:18,4
This makes you wonder why

267
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:19,68
Because the parents don't earn much

268
0:8:19,68 --> 0:8:20,88
They're afraid the kids might feel inferior

269
0:8:20,88 --> 0:8:22,76
But in reality, the parents' income

270
0:8:22,76 --> 0:8:24,44
My parents, for instance, don't earn a lot either

271
0:8:24,44 --> 0:8:25,72
There really isn't much.

272
0:8:25,72 --> 0:8:26,4
There really isn't much.

273
0:8:26,4 --> 0:8:29,8
But they still allocate a portion from their limited company to me.

274
0:8:29,8 --> 0:8:31,34
It's to help me develop a savings habit.

275
0:8:31,34 --> 0:8:33,68
Not to encourage me to spend money.

276
0:8:33,68 --> 0:8:34,68
The money is actually not for me to spend.

277
0:8:34,68 --> 0:8:36,569
Only if you save it up.

278
0:8:36,569 --> 0:8:38,129
You shouldn't spend it.

279
0:8:39,169 --> 0:8:41,889
That's when you truly feel the power of money.

280
0:8:41,889 --> 0:8:44,44
Because back then, Liu Xun said that the money in the first year was really all mine.

281
0:8:44,44 --> 0:8:46,14
It was all saved up by myself.

282
0:8:46,14 --> 0:8:48,32
Only later did I receive financial support from my family.

283
0:8:48,32 --> 0:8:49,28
Money from my parents and such.

284
0:8:49,28 --> 0:8:51,8
The money spent in the first year was mostly what I had saved up myself.

285
0:8:51,8 --> 0:8:54,369
In other words, for my studies abroad,

286
0:8:54,369 --> 0:8:56,469
I used all the 100,000 yuan I had saved from childhood.

287
0:8:56,469 --> 0:8:57,689
It was all spent in one go.

288
0:8:57,689 --> 0:9:0,68
But think about what 100,000 yuan means.

289
0:9:0,68 --> 0:9:2,72
It's 100,000 yuan from 2005.

290
0:9:2,72 --> 0:9:4,4
If you had 300,000 yuan in 2005,

291
0:9:4,4 --> 0:9:5,2
you could have bought a house.

292
0:9:5,2 --> 0:9:5,82
In Beijing.

293
0:9:5,82 --> 0:9:8,8
100,000 yuan in 2005 was actually a lot of money.

294
0:9:8,8 --> 0:9:9,86
And I've been saving it

295
0:9:9,86 --> 0:9:10,68
since I was young,

296
0:9:10,68 --> 0:9:11,44
living frugally and sparingly.

297
0:9:11,44 --> 0:9:12,14
I have to tighten my belt

298
0:9:12,14 --> 0:9:12,83
After all, I

299
0:9:12,83 --> 0:9:14,31
But I still play games, though

300
0:9:14,31 --> 0:9:16,11
Didn't I also buy the PS1 and PS2?

301
0:9:16,11 --> 0:9:16,47
Right?

302
0:9:16,47 --> 0:9:17,71
Write 'is Game Boy Advance'

303
0:9:17,71 --> 0:9:18,35
Didn't I also buy it?

304
0:9:18,35 --> 0:9:20,52
But in reality, I managed to save quite a bit of money

305
0:9:20,52 --> 0:9:24,56
Actually, it formed a very effective savings mindset

306
0:9:24,799 --> 0:9:28,359
Plus, I basically stay away from online loans

307
0:9:28,359 --> 0:9:30,719
or those messy and shady nude photo loans and such

308
0:9:30,719 --> 0:9:31,9
Because quite early on

309
0:9:31,9 --> 0:9:33,3
I mean, when I was around 15 or 16

310
0:9:33,3 --> 0:9:34,66
I got my first credit card

311
0:9:34,66 --> 0:9:38,21
I knew all about overdue payments and installment plans

312
0:9:38,21 --> 0:9:39,87
When I got my first savings card

313
0:9:39,87 --> 0:9:41,26
That's when I set a rule for myself

314
0:9:41,26 --> 0:9:43,86
If I had more than 1,000 yuan in my pocket

315
0:9:43,86 --> 0:9:45,82
Whenever I have more than a thousand bucks in my hands,

316
0:9:45,82 --> 0:9:46,6
I deposit it.

317
0:9:46,6 --> 0:9:48,78
So, I always have a few hundred dollars on me.

318
0:9:48,78 --> 0:9:51,58
I don't mind making multiple trips to the bank.

319
0:9:51,58 --> 0:9:52,14
That's how it is.

320
0:9:52,14 --> 0:9:53,34
When I have more than a thousand bucks in my hands,

321
0:9:53,34 --> 0:9:54,46
I deposit the amount over a thousand bucks.

322
0:9:54,46 --> 0:9:56,26
I deposit the amount over a thousand bucks and don't spend it.

323
0:9:56,26 --> 0:9:57,2
I don't break the bill.

324
0:9:57,2 --> 0:9:58,8
Then you always have a few hundred bucks in your pocket

325
0:9:58,8 --> 0:10:0,28
A few hundred bucks are enough for food and drinks

326
0:10:0,28 --> 0:10:1,14
For you to go out and date

327
0:10:1,14 --> 0:10:2,64
Enough for you to go out and have a good time

328
0:10:2,64 --> 0:10:3,92
You can even afford a hotel room

329
0:10:3,92 --> 0:10:4,89
No problem, right?

330
0:10:4,89 --> 0:10:6,29
But it’s just not enough

331
0:10:6,29 --> 0:10:7,45
For you to make big purchases

332
0:10:7,45 --> 0:10:8,41
Like buying a phone

333
0:10:8,41 --> 0:10:9,23
Buy a gaming console

334
0:10:9,23 --> 0:10:10,51
Definitely not when you're abroad

335
0:10:10,51 --> 0:10:12,21
But I can ensure you won't starve

336
0:10:12,21 --> 0:10:15,11
I'm currently following this principle

337
0:10:15,11 --> 0:10:16,79
So I haven't really been keeping up

338
0:10:16,79 --> 0:10:19,3
I have many times more money now than back then

339
0:10:19,3 --> 0:10:22,74
But I'm still very frugal when it comes to saving

340
0:10:22,74 --> 0:10:23,3
It's a concept

341
0:10:23,3 --> 0:10:25,2
That is, anything over 1000 yuan

342
0:10:25,2 --> 0:10:27,8
As long as there's over a thousand yuan in my WeChat or Alipay

343
0:10:27,8 --> 0:10:28,7
I always transfer it to my bank account

344
0:10:28,7 --> 0:10:30,78
So my bank account always has

345
0:10:30,78 --> 0:10:32,74
various amounts in the thousands

346
0:10:32,74 --> 0:10:33,98
but never in the hundreds

347
0:10:33,98 --> 0:10:35,34
just amounts in the thousands, right

348
0:10:35,34 --> 0:10:37,8
So my savings mindset has always been there.

349
0:10:37,8 --> 0:10:41,9
Actually, I noticed this when I talked to friends who are entrepreneurs

350
0:10:41,9 --> 0:10:42,569
later on

351
0:10:42,569 --> 0:10:45,649
Kids from poor families really like to open stores

352
0:10:45,649 --> 0:10:47,29
They are particularly keen on starting businesses

353
0:10:47,29 --> 0:10:48,449
They are very fond of taking out loans

354
0:10:48,449 --> 0:10:49,689
Borrowing money to partner up

355
0:10:49,689 --> 0:10:51,45
They are willing to do all these things

356
0:10:51,45 --> 0:10:53,1
But once they suffer a loss

357
0:10:53,1 --> 0:10:53,61
When you ask them

358
0:10:53,61 --> 0:10:54,17
How much did you lose?

359
0:10:54,17 --> 0:10:55,33
I now owe 300,000

360
0:10:55,33 --> 0:10:58,41
Hehe, what are you laughing at? What’s so funny?

361
0:10:58,41 --> 0:11:0,5
Dude, what are you laughing at?

362
0:11:0,5 --> 0:11:3,2
Don't you think you're in your thirties now?

363
0:11:3,2 --> 0:11:3,74
Or even forties?

364
0:11:3,74 --> 0:11:5,46
You owe thirty or forty thousand in debt now.

365
0:11:5,46 --> 0:11:7,18
What about your parents?

366
0:11:7,18 --> 0:11:7,98
Aren't they going to get sick?

367
0:11:7,98 --> 0:11:9,44
What about your wife and child?

368
0:11:9,44 --> 0:11:10,76
What are you going to do if you get divorced?

369
0:11:10,76 --> 0:11:13,6
Have you ever thought about what you'll rely on in the future?

370
0:11:13,6 --> 0:11:15,38
Are you planning to find another job?

371
0:11:15,38 --> 0:11:16,86
When it comes to starting your own business,

372
0:11:16,86 --> 0:11:18,18
why can't you take the time to think it through?

373
0:11:18,18 --> 0:11:19,86
why not give it some serious thought?

374
0:11:19,86 --> 0:11:21,34
whether you're really cut out for entrepreneurship,

375
0:11:21,34 --> 0:11:22,71
which industry you should be in,

376
0:11:22,71 --> 0:11:24,79
where you should start from,

377
0:11:24,79 --> 0:11:26,87
you just jump right into opening a coffee shop.

378
0:11:26,87 --> 0:11:28,71
Then I teamed up with a friend

379
0:11:28,71 --> 0:11:30,43
And brought along about 20 more

380
0:11:30,43 --> 0:11:31,21
Around 30 in total

381
0:11:31,21 --> 0:11:32,75
And you start feeling like you’re loaded

382
0:11:32,75 --> 0:11:34,569
But when things go wrong, they just laugh it off

383
0:11:34,569 --> 0:11:35,609
That’s what I’ve seen

384
0:11:35,609 --> 0:11:37,209
My college buddies are like that

385
0:11:37,209 --> 0:11:39,76
They have no sense of money

386
0:11:39,76 --> 0:11:41,16
They end up collecting a lot of cash

387
0:11:41,16 --> 0:11:41,48
Oops

388
0:11:41,48 --> 0:11:43,44
The class fund should be around five or six thousand yuan

389
0:11:43,44 --> 0:11:44,44
Let’s have roasted whole lamb

390
0:11:44,44 --> 0:11:47,65
A roasted whole lamb costs 1800, and then we’re out of money

391
0:11:47,65 --> 0:11:49,7
So he doesn’t have a sense of it

392
0:11:49,7 --> 0:11:51,53
The farm stay owner knew that from the start

393
0:11:51,53 --> 0:11:51,69
Hmm

394
0:11:51,69 --> 0:11:53,49
It’s always like this, no matter how much money you have

395
0:11:53,49 --> 0:11:54,85
I’ll just get the one for 1800

396
0:11:54,85 --> 0:11:57,13
But if he says he only has a thousand bucks in his hand

397
0:11:57,13 --> 0:11:58,85
then 1800 might not be for one

398
0:11:58,85 --> 0:11:59,85
it could be for 610

399
0:11:59,85 --> 0:12:0,4
right?

400
0:12:0,4 --> 0:12:1,56
You pay 1800 for one

401
0:12:1,56 --> 0:12:2,34
and then you get three

402
0:12:2,34 --> 0:12:3,36
they've already calculated it for you

403
0:12:3,36 --> 0:12:5,819
just to use up the five or six thousand you have

404
0:12:5,819 --> 0:12:7,499
so that's how it is for kids from the countryside

405
0:12:7,499 --> 0:12:8,659
This is how you might say it

406
0:12:8,659 --> 0:12:10,839
A common trait among kids from poor families

407
0:12:10,839 --> 0:12:13,72
is that once they get a large sum of money

408
0:12:13,72 --> 0:12:15,2
like if I saved up 600,000

409
0:12:15,2 --> 0:12:17,63
I'd want to buy the Xiaomi 47 Ultra

410
0:12:17,63 --> 0:12:18,87
I really like Xiaomi

411
0:12:18,87 --> 0:12:19,73
I admire Lei Jun

412
0:12:19,73 --> 0:12:20,77
I like his products

413
0:12:20,77 --> 0:12:21,91
I like Dong Ge too

414
0:12:21,91 --> 0:12:22,77
I like Pang Donglai

415
0:12:22,77 --> 0:12:23,73
I'll spend money there

416
0:12:23,73 --> 0:12:25,92
I feel like that way I'm supporting a national entrepreneur

417
0:12:25,92 --> 0:12:27,2
Is that really the case?

418
0:12:27,2 --> 0:12:29,28
Dude, your social status hasn't changed

419
0:12:29,28 --> 0:12:31,67
Dude, your social status hasn't changed

420
0:12:31,67 --> 0:12:33,31
You still have the same income

421
0:12:33,31 --> 0:12:33,71
Right?

422
0:12:33,71 --> 0:12:34,79
So in many cases

423
0:12:34,79 --> 0:12:37,42
We say that actually, children from poor families tend to waste money

424
0:12:37,42 --> 0:12:38,54
and borrow money

425
0:12:38,54 --> 0:12:39,26
and take out loans

426
0:12:39,26 --> 0:12:40,42
and this is why

427
0:12:40,42 --> 0:12:41,42
because they haven't been taught financial literacy from a young age

428
0:12:41,42 --> 0:12:45,99
Most importantly, they need to be given money

429
0:12:45,339 --> 0:12:47,699
given money

430
0:12:47,699 --> 0:12:48,419
to learn how to save

431
0:12:49,479 --> 0:12:50,299
Give him the credit card

432
0:12:50,299 --> 0:12:51,19
Let him spend it

433
0:12:51,19 --> 0:12:52,999
Let him experience what it feels like to be in debt

434
0:12:52,999 --> 0:12:53,779
Don’t do it for him

435
0:12:53,779 --> 0:12:56,94
He should also understand what debt is from a young age

436
0:12:56,94 --> 0:12:57,7
What a loan is

437
0:12:57,7 --> 0:12:58,66
What savings are

438
0:12:58,66 --> 0:13:0,8
What it means to live within one's means

439
0:13:0,8 --> 0:13:1,72
These concepts must be explained

440
0:13:1,72 --> 0:13:3,79
Not to mention five or six years old

441
0:13:3,79 --> 0:13:4,899
Not to mention ten years old

442
0:13:4,899 --> 0:13:5,539
Eight or nine years old

443
0:13:5,539 --> 0:13:9,3
You should at least teach them by the time they're 12 to 16

444
0:13:9,3 --> 0:13:10,79
So when many parents talk about it

445
0:13:10,79 --> 0:13:12,31
Regarding their children's sexual education

446
0:13:12,31 --> 0:13:13,58
Financial matters

447
0:13:13,58 --> 0:13:16,1
Issues of power, lying, and such

448
0:13:16,1 --> 0:13:18,0
Including some of the unwritten rules in society

449
0:13:18,0 --> 0:13:19,18
You're completely unprepared.

450
0:13:19,18 --> 0:13:20,38
Just focus on your studies, that's all.

451
0:13:20,38 --> 0:13:22,79
Don't worry about other things; your parents will take care of them.

452
0:13:22,79 --> 0:13:26,6
Can your parents really think about arranging such matters for him, like going out to mate with others?

453
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:28,48
You've never let him date.

454
0:13:28,48 --> 0:13:29,56
Not even in college.

455
0:13:29,56 --> 0:13:31,65
So you want him to start mating right after graduation?

456
0:13:31,65 --> 0:13:33,75
Just mating with strangers one by one, like blind dates.

457
0:13:33,75 --> 0:13:35,329
And then they go straight into the bedroom together.

458
0:13:35,329 --> 0:13:36,869
Isn't that for a fool?

459
0:13:36,869 --> 0:13:37,949
Does that person understand?

460
0:13:37,949 --> 0:13:38,849
Does he understand these things?

461
0:13:38,849 --> 0:13:39,77
He might have understood.

462
0:13:39,77 --> 0:13:42,17
But his understanding comes from those pornographic materials.

463
0:13:42,17 --> 0:13:43,25
He hasn't had proper education.

464
0:13:43,25 --> 0:13:45,48
Why would your parents drop the ball like this?

465
0:13:45,48 --> 0:13:46,92
Your parents keep giving him this stuff.

466
0:13:46,92 --> 0:13:48,76
They're driving him to the point where his mental health is suffering.

467
0:13:48,76 --> 0:13:50,2
Pushing him to study all the time

468
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:50,72
Forcing him to be healthy

469
0:13:50,72 --> 0:13:51,82
Oh, I think you don't understand

470
0:13:51,82 --> 0:13:53,49
You don't know how tough the future society will be

471
0:13:53,49 --> 0:13:56,21
Do you know how your family will survive in society in the future?

472
0:13:56,21 --> 0:13:58,19
You haven't even taught him financial literacy

473
0:13:58,19 --> 0:14:0,43
So, when it comes to you, these parents

474
0:14:0,43 --> 0:14:1,67
What kind of background do parents really have

475
0:14:1,67 --> 0:14:2,73
They bring that background with them

476
0:14:2,73 --> 0:14:4,27
Your parents' generation was like that.

477
0:14:4,27 --> 0:14:7,8
Your children won't be much better off than your parents.

478
0:14:7,8 --> 0:14:10,28
Your parents' generation was quite backward.

479
0:14:10,28 --> 0:14:14,9
From the perspective of a low-level labor force's mentality.

480
0:14:14,9 --> 0:14:16,25
I'm not saying I look down on any workers.

481
0:14:16,25 --> 0:14:18,24
Nor am I looking down on any poor people.

482
0:14:18,24 --> 0:14:19,28
When it comes to people.

483
0:14:19,28 --> 0:14:20,84
We are a country where the people are in charge.

484
0:14:20,84 --> 0:14:21,92
But you need to understand.

485
0:14:21,92 --> 0:14:23,52
This society is competitive.

486
0:14:23,52 --> 0:14:25,4
Some people live in luxury.

487
0:14:25,4 --> 0:14:25,96
And some face hardships.

488
0:14:25,96 --> 0:14:27,12
You don't think that's fair, do you?

489
0:14:27,12 --> 0:14:28,2
The purpose of your studies,

490
0:14:28,2 --> 0:14:32,3
Isn't it to avoid living like this today?

491
0:14:32,3 --> 0:14:34,18
To make tomorrow better?

492
0:14:34,18 --> 0:14:36,62
What's the prerequisite for a better tomorrow?

493
0:14:36,62 --> 0:14:38,1
To ensure your children don't suffer like you do,

494
0:14:38,1 --> 0:14:40,79
What's the prerequisite for them not to endure so much hardship?

495
0:14:40,79 --> 0:14:41,519
If you struggle with learning yourself,

496
0:14:41,519 --> 0:14:43,119
And you push them to study every day,

497
0:14:43,119 --> 0:14:45,99
Isn't that a dead-end problem?

498
0:14:45,99 --> 0:14:46,19
Because you're not smart,

499
0:14:46,19 --> 0:14:47,52
They might not be either.

500
0:14:47,52 --> 0:14:51,19
So why not cultivate them in other areas?

501
0:14:51,55 --> 0:14:52,55
You need to understand,

502
0:14:52,55 --> 0:14:54,99
It's not just about academic learning.

503
0:14:54,99 --> 0:14:58,19
You can't replace their financial awareness with these things.

504
0:14:58,19 --> 0:14:59,7
The less money you have,

505
0:14:59,7 --> 0:15:0,71
The earlier you should give them some.

506
0:15:0,71 --> 0:15:2,43
You need to instill in them the awareness,

507
0:15:2,43 --> 0:15:4,55
That the family isn't wealthy.

508
0:15:4,55 --> 0:15:5,47
That the family isn't well-off.

509
0:15:5,47 --> 0:15:6,67
So they think about earning money,

510
0:15:6,67 --> 0:15:8,3
And saving money.

511
0:15:8,3 --> 0:15:9,87
If they don't know how much the family has,

512
0:15:9,87 --> 0:15:11,67
They won't understand the value of money.

513
0:15:11,67 --> 0:15:12,85
Once they have a bit more money,

514
0:15:12,85 --> 0:15:14,35
They might spend it with friends,

515
0:15:14,35 --> 0:15:15,89
Or worse, turn to crime when they run out.

516
0:15:15,89 --> 0:15:18,75
This mindset can lead people astray.

517
0:15:18,75 --> 0:15:19,81
It's crucial,

518
0:15:19,81 --> 0:15:21,4
To instill a proper concept of money.

519
0:15:21,4 --> 0:15:23,68
The concept of money is truly very important.

520
0:15:23,68 --> 0:15:26,68
Many parents fail to instill this awareness from a young age.

521
0:15:26,68 --> 0:15:28,64
So when they grow up,

522
0:15:28,64 --> 0:15:29,64
They face all sorts of problems,

523
0:15:29,64 --> 0:15:30,56
Debt,

524
0:15:30,56 --> 0:15:31,44
Bankruptcy,

525
0:15:31,44 --> 0:15:32,92
These are very real issues.

526
0:15:32,92 --> 0:15:35,88
No matter what you say about morals and values,

527
0:15:35,88 --> 0:15:37,68
Personal pursuits and beliefs,

528
0:15:37,68 --> 0:15:39,48
All these things are important,

529
0:15:39,48 --> 0:15:42,749
But if you make mistakes with money,

530
0:15:42,749 --> 0:15:44,749
If you can't make ends meet,

531
0:15:44,749 --> 0:15:48,79
Your family could fall apart.

532
0:15:48,79 --> 0:15:49,879
No amount of insurance can fix that.

533
0:15:49,879 --> 0:15:53,9
These lessons must be taught to children from a young age.

534
0:15:53,9 --> 0:15:54,95
So if there are any parents here,

535
0:15:54,95 --> 0:15:57,13
Remember to get your child a credit card early,

536
0:15:57,13 --> 0:15:58,55
Even a supplementary card,

537
0:15:58,55 --> 0:16:0,19
Give them their own money early,

538
0:16:0,19 --> 0:16:1,29
Teach them to save,

539
0:16:1,29 --> 0:16:2,329
Instill in them a sense of financial literacy.

540
0:16:2,329 --> 0:16:4,89
Because poor children tend to spend freely,

541
0:16:4,89 --> 0:16:5,809
Being extravagant,

542
0:16:5,809 --> 0:16:6,509
While rich children tend to be modest and cautious,

543
0:16:6,509 --> 0:16:8,969
Not arrogant or restless.
