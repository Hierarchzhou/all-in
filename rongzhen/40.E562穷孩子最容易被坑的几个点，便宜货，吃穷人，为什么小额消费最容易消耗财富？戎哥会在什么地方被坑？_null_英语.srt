1
0:0:0,48 --> 0:0:2,6
Against consumerism

2
0:0:2,6 --> 0:0:3,3
Accumulating personal wealth

3
0:0:3,3 --> 0:0:4,52
Preparing to transcend social classes

4
0:0:4,52 --> 0:0:5,28
Hi everyone

5
0:0:5,28 --> 0:0:6,85
I'm Long Zhen

6
0:0:6,85 --> 0:0:11,51
In essence, everyone is a slave to consumerism

7
0:0:11,51 --> 0:0:14,59
Bro Rong just doesn't buy houses or cars

8
0:0:14,59 --> 0:0:17,29
Can't afford a house or a car

9
0:0:17,29 --> 0:0:18,19
No quotas

10
0:0:18,19 --> 0:0:19,71
But now there are indicators.

11
0:0:19,71 --> 0:0:22,7
So Brother Rong found himself in a dilemma about buying a car.

12
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:24,58
In this episode, I mainly want to talk about

13
0:0:24,58 --> 0:0:27,6
some of my personal spending habits and the challenges they pose.

14
0:0:27,6 --> 0:0:30,4
So I’m here to give you a little warning.

15
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:31,9
Especially to young people.

16
0:0:31,9 --> 0:0:36,18
You’ll notice that one thing that really bothers me now

17
0:0:36,18 --> 0:0:38,26
is that no matter what platform it is,

18
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:39,82
you can always borrow money.

19
0:0:39,82 --> 0:0:42,3
And they all want to borrow money from you

20
0:0:42,3 --> 0:0:45,37
We won’t mention the names of these platforms

21
0:0:45,37 --> 0:0:46,83
To avoid getting lawyer letters from them

22
0:0:46,83 --> 0:0:48,69
But we’re talking about all shopping platforms

23
0:0:48,69 --> 0:0:49,75
Food delivery platforms

24
0:0:51,15 --> 0:0:52,41
And also

25
0:0:52,41 --> 0:0:54,41
Financial platforms, which go without saying

26
0:0:54,41 --> 0:0:55,94
Banking apps

27
0:0:55,94 --> 0:0:58,24
As well as social messaging apps

28
0:0:58,24 --> 0:1:0,24
They're all trying to borrow money from you

29
0:1:0,24 --> 0:1:2,18
Would Brother Rong lend money?

30
0:1:2,18 --> 0:1:3,2
Brother Rong wouldn't lend money

31
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:7,67
He lends money to those young people

32
0:1:7,67 --> 0:1:9,71
People who need to borrow money are those who don't have money

33
0:1:9,71 --> 0:1:11,45
People with money don't need to borrow

34
0:1:11,45 --> 0:1:13,39
Wealthy people lend money

35
0:1:13,39 --> 0:1:15,55
Wealthy people gather together

36
0:1:15,55 --> 0:1:17,19
They pool their money together

37
0:1:17,19 --> 0:1:18,43
What makes money?

38
0:1:18,43 --> 0:1:20,22
What brings in cash quickly?

39
0:1:20,22 --> 0:1:20,78
Right?

40
0:1:20,78 --> 0:1:22,38
Doing research is so demanding.

41
0:1:22,38 --> 0:1:23,28
Isn't it?

42
0:1:23,28 --> 0:1:25,4
But look at the same period.

43
0:1:25,4 --> 0:1:27,6
We're not talking about being overly fond of foreign things.

44
0:1:27,6 --> 0:1:28,71
Nor are we saying anything specific.

45
0:1:28,71 --> 0:1:30,91
Look at Amazon abroad.

46
0:1:30,91 --> 0:1:31,57
Google

47
0:1:31,57 --> 0:1:33,79
might not have as many

48
0:1:33,79 --> 0:1:35,71
it’s not very convenient to borrow money

49
0:1:35,71 --> 0:1:36,19
right?

50
0:1:36,19 --> 0:1:37,55
it’s not very convenient

51
0:1:37,55 --> 0:1:40,23
I think the financial innovation and reform in our country

52
0:1:40,23 --> 0:1:42,5
has really been fantastic

53
0:1:42,5 --> 0:1:43,59
you can borrow money from all kinds of platforms

54
0:1:43,59 --> 0:1:44,43
that’s a good thing

55
0:1:44,43 --> 0:1:45,57
This is a good thing.

56
0:1:45,57 --> 0:1:46,61
It's a good thing.

57
0:1:46,61 --> 0:1:51,1
So often, it leads to a lot of young people

58
0:1:51,1 --> 0:1:51,99
borrowing money

59
0:1:51,99 --> 0:1:54,81
spending on consumption

60
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:56,95
you could say many people are spending

61
0:1:56,95 --> 0:1:58,45
boosting the economy

62
0:1:58,45 --> 0:1:59,1
not spending

63
0:1:59,1 --> 0:1:59,39
how can that work?

64
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:0,1
No one's spending money

65
0:2:0,1 --> 0:2:0,95
How's the economy supposed to work?

66
0:2:0,95 --> 0:2:3,22
Are you willing to go into debt?

67
0:2:3,22 --> 0:2:4,22
I'm asking you.

68
0:2:4,22 --> 0:2:5,5
You're the one spending money.

69
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:6,82
You're boosting the economy, right?

70
0:2:6,82 --> 0:2:8,72
You're getting drained dry.

71
0:2:8,72 --> 0:2:9,86
You'll be done for.

72
0:2:9,86 --> 0:2:10,58
Isn't that right?

73
0:2:10,58 --> 0:2:14,19
So, most importantly, it's about growing the pie.

74
0:2:14,19 --> 0:2:15,939
It's about giving everyone the means to spend.

75
0:2:15,939 --> 0:2:17,999
Not about encouraging people to borrow to spend.

76
0:2:17,999 --> 0:2:19,499
Then fall into high-interest loans.

77
0:2:19,499 --> 0:2:20,899
And end up paying exorbitant interest rates.

78
0:2:20,899 --> 0:2:22,2
Is that what you mean?

79
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:24,26
In today's society,

80
0:2:24,26 --> 0:2:27,37
I want to tell everyone that borrowing to consume is the least rational thing to do.

81
0:2:27,37 --> 0:2:30,15
Even when you have money, don't borrow.

82
0:2:30,15 --> 0:2:31,71
Don't spend at all.

83
0:2:31,71 --> 0:2:32,69
Often, we talk about

84
0:2:32,69 --> 0:2:35,21
where we should be spending our money.

85
0:2:35,21 --> 0:2:36,45
This is crucial.

86
0:2:36,45 --> 0:2:40,959
You see, Rong never takes a taxi when he goes out.

87
0:2:40,959 --> 0:2:42,519
We don't take the bus either.

88
0:2:42,519 --> 0:2:43,599
We always take taxis, right?

89
0:2:43,599 --> 0:2:45,23
Support our Didi app.

90
0:2:45,23 --> 0:2:48,13
After going out, eat when you need to eat.

91
0:2:48,13 --> 0:2:49,81
Enjoy the vibrant street food

92
0:2:49,81 --> 0:2:50,87
Street vendors

93
0:2:50,87 --> 0:2:53,75
Or the stores in the mall

94
0:2:53,75 --> 0:2:54,89
I go to Vargas every day

95
0:2:54,89 --> 0:2:56,15
I often spend money there

96
0:2:56,15 --> 0:2:58,53
Bro Rong's spending helps boost the economy

97
0:2:58,53 --> 0:2:59,17
Right?

98
0:2:59,17 --> 0:3:1,15
I'm often willing to spend

99
0:3:1,15 --> 0:3:3,75
But I do think some spending is unnecessary

100
0:3:3,75 --> 0:3:7,5
For example, Wen often buys from overseas platforms

101
0:3:7,5 --> 0:3:8,959
like games on Steam

102
0:3:8,959 --> 0:3:11,39
Today, EPIC is giving away Civilization VI

103
0:3:11,39 --> 0:3:12,239
Everyone remember to claim it

104
0:3:12,239 --> 0:3:14,56
I frequently buy games on Steam

105
0:3:14,56 --> 0:3:16,4
and books from various platforms

106
0:3:16,4 --> 0:3:17,22
I often purchase them

107
0:3:17,22 --> 0:3:22,7
These two items are typical examples of Long's excessive spending

108
0:3:22,7 --> 0:3:25,77
In reality, I buy a book when I think it’s useful

109
0:3:25,77 --> 0:3:27,19
I think the future will read

110
0:3:27,19 --> 0:3:28,51
so I bought it

111
0:3:28,51 --> 0:3:31,15
But when you actually flip through the book

112
0:3:31,15 --> 0:3:33,5
you might forget why you impulsively bought it in the first place

113
0:3:33,5 --> 0:3:34,7
you might forget why you bought it

114
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:36,47
I've bought a lot of books on Douyin

115
0:3:36,47 --> 0:3:38,27
Books on Douyin can be quite expensive

116
0:3:38,27 --> 0:3:40,63
But if you switch to other platforms to buy books

117
0:3:40,63 --> 0:3:41,91
you'll find they are much cheaper

118
0:3:41,91 --> 0:3:42,99
Even buying e-books

119
0:3:42,99 --> 0:3:44,39
But to be honest

120
0:3:44,39 --> 0:3:46,27
You see, a lot of the time

121
0:3:46,27 --> 0:3:48,84
You don’t really need that many books

122
0:3:48,84 --> 0:3:50,46
Even if you’re a knowledge influencer

123
0:3:50,46 --> 0:3:52,82
You can’t read mountains and mountains of books

124
0:3:52,82 --> 0:3:56,9
I’ve bought around 500 books that are now stored at home

125
0:3:56,9 --> 0:3:58,99
On top of that, I already have over 1,000 books on my bookshelves at home

126
0:3:58,99 --> 0:4:0,829
It’s almost like having a bookstore

127
0:4:0,829 --> 0:4:2,389
And there's no place to put them.

128
0:4:2,389 --> 0:4:3,589
This could be a fire hazard.

129
0:4:3,589 --> 0:4:5,249
It's really not good at all.

130
0:4:5,249 --> 0:4:8,13
I always place the fire extinguisher before I go out.

131
0:4:8,13 --> 0:4:10,53
Fortunately, I don't have the habit of smoking at home.

132
0:4:10,53 --> 0:4:12,99
So, you know, it's still pretty concerning.

133
0:4:12,99 --> 0:4:14,81
You know the games on Steam.

134
0:4:14,81 --> 0:4:17,5
If you add me as a Steam friend, JAMESR61,

135
0:4:17,5 --> 0:4:20,54
You'll find I have way too many games, way too many.

136
0:4:20,54 --> 0:4:21,56
There's just no end to it

137
0:4:21,56 --> 0:4:23,38
But I still buy them, especially when there's a discount

138
0:4:23,38 --> 0:4:24,5
That's my weakness

139
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:25,38
One is books

140
0:4:25,38 --> 0:4:26,48
The other is games

141
0:4:26,48 --> 0:4:29,46
I always feel that I'll need these things when I retire

142
0:4:29,46 --> 0:4:31,48
But it's actually completely unnecessary

143
0:4:31,48 --> 0:4:33,5
Actually, I should have done it when I was younger

144
0:4:33,5 --> 0:4:35,86
Taken more trips while I was in good shape

145
0:4:35,86 --> 0:4:39,48
Some people say, Rong, you don’t recommend traveling every day, right?

146
0:4:39,48 --> 0:4:42,44
Ah, I don’t suggest it if you’re a white-collar worker

147
0:4:42,44 --> 0:4:43,65
As someone

148
0:4:43,65 --> 0:4:47,49
who is working for a capitalist

149
0:4:49,35 --> 0:4:51,41
and has just saved up 100,000 to go traveling

150
0:4:51,41 --> 0:4:53,39
I should travel, shouldn’t I?

151
0:4:53,39 --> 0:4:55,23
Because I don’t just have 100,000

152
0:4:55,23 --> 0:4:57,88
I have many, many 100,000s

153
0:4:57,88 --> 0:5:0,8
So if I go traveling

154
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:1,52
Especially as an UPloader,

155
0:5:1,52 --> 0:5:3,92
traveling should be like Brother Feng and Lan Zhanfei,

156
0:5:3,92 --> 0:5:5,8
get out and enjoy more often,

157
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:6,39
that's what we should do,

158
0:5:6,39 --> 0:5:8,519
but I have to take the kids on weekends,

159
0:5:8,519 --> 0:5:11,39
so sometimes I'm just not willing to go out,

160
0:5:11,39 --> 0:5:13,79
but actually, occasionally not taking the kids,

161
0:5:13,79 --> 0:5:14,219
is also fine,

162
0:5:14,219 --> 0:5:16,35
you can hire someone temporarily, you know.

163
0:5:16,35 --> 0:5:17,45
Whether it's a nanny

164
0:5:17,45 --> 0:5:18,43
or

165
0:5:18,43 --> 0:5:19,5
my parents

166
0:5:19,5 --> 0:5:20,9
if they are in better health

167
0:5:20,9 --> 0:5:20,85
of course, it's possible

168
0:5:20,85 --> 0:5:23,2
so I'm actually tied down by my child now

169
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:25,16
but the child isn't an excuse

170
0:5:25,16 --> 0:5:27,0
young people should still go out more

171
0:5:27,0 --> 0:5:28,68
I would have more opportunities at 40 than at 50

172
0:5:28,68 --> 0:5:29,68
Going out at 60 is strong

173
0:5:29,68 --> 0:5:30,8
It's better than going out at 70

174
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:31,12
Right?

175
0:5:31,12 --> 0:5:32,8
By then, you might be in the hospital

176
0:5:32,8 --> 0:5:34,68
Your body won't be as good when you get to the hospital

177
0:5:34,68 --> 0:5:37,51
So, you should still have fun when you can

178
0:5:37,51 --> 0:5:39,78
But I mean, if you spend the same amount of money to buy

179
0:5:39,78 --> 0:5:40,76
A luxury car

180
0:5:40,76 --> 0:5:41,4
Or a house

181
0:5:41,4 --> 0:5:42,76
You might as well go out and have fun.

182
0:5:42,76 --> 0:5:43,88
Because for me,

183
0:5:43,88 --> 0:5:45,56
going out to play means making money.

184
0:5:45,56 --> 0:5:48,809
Every time I go out to shoot, I get ads.

185
0:5:48,809 --> 0:5:51,89
It can boost the traffic of my videos.

186
0:5:51,89 --> 0:5:52,209
It can also gain new followers.

187
0:5:52,209 --> 0:5:55,56
Of course, when you’re browsing all this on Bilibili today,

188
0:5:55,56 --> 0:5:57,72
I particularly love watching travel shows in Japan.

189
0:5:57,72 --> 0:5:59,12
Although I won’t really travel to Japan.

190
0:5:59,12 --> 0:6:0,96
But I really enjoy watching travel shows about Japan

191
0:6:0,96 --> 0:6:3,18
And I've even got a five-year visa for Japan

192
0:6:3,5 --> 0:6:6,12
I always think that once my Japanese reaches N2 level

193
0:6:6,12 --> 0:6:7,1
I'll go to Japan again

194
0:6:7,1 --> 0:6:8,94
I mentioned that I have this lingering concern

195
0:6:8,94 --> 0:6:9,94
But a lot of people tell me

196
0:6:9,94 --> 0:6:10,66
You don't need to

197
0:6:10,66 --> 0:6:13,99
Just speak in the noble accent of Abe ICA

198
0:6:13,99 --> 0:6:15,81
Has Brother Rong also lived in North America?

199
0:6:15,81 --> 0:6:16,97
Just speak to him in English

200
0:6:16,97 --> 0:6:18,679
and you'll enjoy premium service

201
0:6:18,679 --> 0:6:20,299
but I think that's not very polite

202
0:6:20,299 --> 0:6:20,799
you know

203
0:6:20,799 --> 0:6:21,879
in some small places

204
0:6:21,879 --> 0:6:24,219
like I want to go to the Kumano Kodo or something

205
0:6:24,219 --> 0:6:27,56
I want to go to that place, what's it called

206
0:6:27,56 --> 0:6:29,48
what's the Dan Road 88

207
0:6:29,48 --> 0:6:33,21
that's the Buddhist pilgrimage, right

208
0:6:35,25 --> 0:6:38,24
It's basically hiking, which I really enjoy.

209
0:6:38,24 --> 0:6:40,88
What I truly want to do is a road trip in America.

210
0:6:40,88 --> 0:6:42,0
I can't go on a road trip in Japan.

211
0:6:42,0 --> 0:6:44,21
But I can do it in Europe.

212
0:6:44,21 --> 0:6:46,15
There are actually quite a few things I want to do.

213
0:6:46,15 --> 0:6:47,25
I actually find it easy to get a French visa.

214
0:6:47,25 --> 0:6:47,81
A Canadian visa,

215
0:6:47,81 --> 0:6:48,93
and a U.S. visa are all quite easy to obtain.

216
0:6:48,93 --> 0:6:49,33
Right?

217
0:6:49,33 --> 0:6:52,9
I've already got my Japanese visa, right?

218
0:6:52,9 --> 0:6:53,85
But the only place I don't want to go is Southeast Asia.

219
0:6:53,85 --> 0:6:54,57
I don't want to go to Africa.

220
0:6:54,57 --> 0:6:55,37
I don't want to go to Central America.

221
0:6:55,37 --> 0:6:56,53
I don't want to go to South America or the Middle East.

222
0:6:56,53 --> 0:6:58,5
I don't want to visit South Korea either.

223
0:6:58,5 --> 0:7:0,8
I'm not really fond of these places.

224
0:7:0,8 --> 0:7:2,68
But when it comes to Europe,

225
0:7:2,68 --> 0:7:3,62
and North America,

226
0:7:3,62 --> 0:7:4,24
Including Japan

227
0:7:4,24 --> 0:7:5,64
I still quite like it

228
0:7:5,64 --> 0:7:7,88
Of course, this is considered an American colony

229
0:7:7,88 --> 0:7:8,44
Right?

230
0:7:8,44 --> 0:7:9,159
Um

231
0:7:9,159 --> 0:7:10,679
But anyway

232
0:7:10,679 --> 0:7:16,25
You'll notice that my spending pattern is that I don't spend big

233
0:7:16,25 --> 0:7:18,11
For example, buying another apartment in Beijing

234
0:7:18,11 --> 0:7:18,75
I wouldn't do that

235
0:7:18,75 --> 0:7:19,95
I won't just throw money around.

236
0:7:19,95 --> 0:7:22,539
I won't buy property anywhere, either.

237
0:7:22,539 --> 0:7:24,499
Of course, I take that back.

238
0:7:24,499 --> 0:7:25,959
I wouldn't say that.

239
0:7:25,959 --> 0:7:27,919
I won't buy property anywhere in the country.

240
0:7:27,919 --> 0:7:28,779
That's what I'm saying.

241
0:7:28,779 --> 0:7:30,26
That's about right.

242
0:7:30,26 --> 0:7:31,7
From an investment perspective,

243
0:7:31,7 --> 0:7:32,38
Well,

244
0:7:32,38 --> 0:7:33,5
Let's talk about the car.

245
0:7:33,5 --> 0:7:36,14
Look, I'm currently pondering between the BYD Dolphin and the Seagull.

246
0:7:36,14 --> 0:7:37,8
I'm really trying to decide whether it’s the Seagull or the Dolphin.

247
0:7:37,8 --> 0:7:40,36
Actually, it’s also about saving some money.

248
0:7:40,36 --> 0:7:42,49
Because I have to buy something for this festival.

249
0:7:42,49 --> 0:7:46,27
But in fact, all the other expenses are where I actually spend my money.

250
0:7:46,27 --> 0:7:49,79
Actually, I had a method for calculating this before.

251
0:7:49,79 --> 0:7:50,55
It’s a simple principle.

252
0:7:50,55 --> 0:7:52,91
If you haven’t used it in 12 to 18 months

253
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:53,99
You should just throw it away.

254
0:7:53,99 --> 0:7:56,23
Of course, if you follow that line of thinking.

255
0:7:56,23 --> 0:7:58,7
Then you'd have to get rid of way too many things.

256
0:7:58,7 --> 0:8:0,58
So sometimes you can't completely adhere to that.

257
0:8:0,58 --> 0:8:4,26
But I once wrote a program myself.

258
0:8:4,26 --> 0:8:6,48
It was a home inventory software.

259
0:8:6,48 --> 0:8:7,42
What is inventory software?

260
0:8:7,42 --> 0:8:9,23
Some people call it a household accounting software.

261
0:8:9,23 --> 0:8:11,97
I use it to keep track of items in my home.

262
0:8:11,97 --> 0:8:14,67
I recorded the position based on this 3D location.

263
0:8:14,67 --> 0:8:16,47
What's actually at this spot?

264
0:8:16,47 --> 0:8:18,1
Do you know the coordinates?

265
0:8:18,1 --> 0:8:19,91
And there's a little coordinate system inside the house.

266
0:8:19,91 --> 0:8:21,25
And there are things placed there.

267
0:8:21,25 --> 0:8:22,85
The goal is to avoid buying duplicates.

268
0:8:22,85 --> 0:8:25,13
But later I found that managing this inventory was

269
0:8:25,13 --> 0:8:26,5
Such a tedious task.

270
0:8:26,5 --> 0:8:27,94
There are so many items to buy.

271
0:8:27,94 --> 0:8:30,38
But I really feel like I'm buying too much stuff these days.

272
0:8:30,38 --> 0:8:33,26
It's because there are so many things at home,

273
0:8:33,26 --> 0:8:36,48
I have about 20 unopened packages or so.

274
0:8:36,48 --> 0:8:37,22
I'm just too lazy to open them.

275
0:8:37,22 --> 0:8:38,8
I know what they are,

276
0:8:38,8 --> 0:8:39,9
but I don't need them now, so I'm too lazy to open them.

277
0:8:39,9 --> 0:8:41,82
This is something characteristic of our time,

278
0:8:41,82 --> 0:8:43,5
it's really an issue that everyone encounters.

279
0:8:43,5 --> 0:8:44,3
Many people mention Brother Rong.

280
0:8:44,3 --> 0:8:45,42
You tell others not to buy a house

281
0:8:45,42 --> 0:8:45,98
not to buy a car

282
0:8:45,98 --> 0:8:49,3
and to avoid debt, rationally opposing consumerism

283
0:8:49,3 --> 0:8:52,28
but in fact, Brother Rong has also been deeply harmed by consumerism

284
0:8:52,28 --> 0:8:54,14
I just don’t have any credit card debt

285
0:8:54,14 --> 0:8:55,88
or any internet finance debt

286
0:8:55,88 --> 0:8:57,4
I don’t have any debt

287
0:8:57,4 --> 0:8:59,66
but to be honest, this spending habit isn’t good

288
0:8:59,66 --> 0:9:1,41
it involves buying a lot of stuff

289
0:9:1,41 --> 0:9:2,77
What is this even called?

290
0:9:2,77 --> 0:9:4,63
This is called taking advantage of the poor with low prices.

291
0:9:4,63 --> 0:9:6,41
Low prices are making people poor.

292
0:9:6,41 --> 0:9:9,17
Pinduoduo's items are all about cheap prices that can impoverish people.

293
0:9:9,17 --> 0:9:10,1
Things that cost ten or twenty bucks.

294
0:9:10,1 --> 0:9:11,9
You might think it doesn't matter.

295
0:9:11,9 --> 0:9:12,97
I also bought some things from JD today.

296
0:9:12,97 --> 0:9:15,3
But they're actually things I don't really need.

297
0:9:15,3 --> 0:9:17,78
They're also items that cost ten or twenty bucks.

298
0:9:17,78 --> 0:9:20,78
Get some health supplements for a hundred bucks or so.

299
0:9:20,78 --> 0:9:22,18
Pick up some gadgets.

300
0:9:22,18 --> 0:9:23,54
Spend a few dozen bucks on some games.

301
0:9:23,54 --> 0:9:24,54
Around fifty to sixty bucks.

302
0:9:24,54 --> 0:9:26,89
Buy all sorts of different things.

303
0:9:26,89 --> 0:9:29,27
All sorts of Japanese books.

304
0:9:29,27 --> 0:9:30,13
Russian books.

305
0:9:30,13 --> 0:9:31,23
Why don’t you get them?

306
0:9:31,23 --> 0:9:32,819
Maybe a few dozen bucks.

307
0:9:32,819 --> 0:9:37,539
This is called taking advantage of the poor by cutting small expenses.

308
0:9:37,539 --> 0:9:38,819
He has you figured out.

309
0:9:38,819 --> 0:9:39,899
He has you completely figured out.

310
0:9:39,899 --> 0:9:41,39
So if you want to save money,

311
0:9:41,39 --> 0:9:42,19
the real method is,

312
0:9:42,19 --> 0:9:43,78
not just to save on big expenses,

313
0:9:43,78 --> 0:9:45,58
but to save on small expenses as well.

314
0:9:45,58 --> 0:9:47,2
Save to the extreme.

315
0:9:47,2 --> 0:9:48,26
Save to the utmost.

316
0:9:48,26 --> 0:9:52,69
You usually shouldn’t open shopping apps just to browse.

317
0:9:52,69 --> 0:9:53,81
You’ll find that a lot of the time,

318
0:9:53,81 --> 0:9:56,64
you don’t even know how your money gets spent.

319
0:9:56,64 --> 0:9:57,94
Especially if you have a credit card.

320
0:9:57,94 --> 0:9:58,6
Of course,

321
0:9:58,6 --> 0:10:0,32
Bro Rong mentioned earlier,

322
0:10:0,32 --> 0:10:1,0
don’t buy a house,

323
0:10:1,0 --> 0:10:1,87
don’t buy a car,

324
0:10:1,87 --> 0:10:3,75
but he didn’t tell you that in the second half.

325
0:10:3,75 --> 0:10:6,41
Small payments can include buying books

326
0:10:6,41 --> 0:10:7,27
buying games

327
0:10:7,27 --> 0:10:8,3
buying clothes

328
0:10:8,3 --> 0:10:9,97
buying all sorts of tools

329
0:10:9,97 --> 0:10:11,1
but these things are actually not necessary

330
0:10:11,1 --> 0:10:14,93
what white people really need is the 2,200 calories a day

331
0:10:14,93 --> 0:10:17,19
it's important to learn how to cook

332
0:10:17,19 --> 0:10:18,43
get the meals prepared

333
0:10:18,43 --> 0:10:19,85
eat a bit simpler

334
0:10:19,85 --> 0:10:21,55
Then this will make you very happy.

335
0:10:21,55 --> 0:10:24,179
Life should have some happiness, after all.

336
0:10:24,179 --> 0:10:26,819
These are the kinds of happiness that adults enjoy.

337
0:10:26,819 --> 0:10:27,459
Adult happiness.

338
0:10:27,459 --> 0:10:28,679
Like having a little drink.

339
0:10:28,679 --> 0:10:29,85
Having a small smoke.

340
0:10:29,85 --> 0:10:30,97
Taking a little walk.

341
0:10:30,97 --> 0:10:31,85
Riding a small motorcycle.

342
0:10:31,85 --> 0:10:33,29
These little joys.

343
0:10:33,29 --> 0:10:35,44
Let's talk about these little joys in life

344
0:10:35,44 --> 0:10:37,0
the life of ordinary folks

345
0:10:37,0 --> 0:10:39,84
and often you need to know that you are just an ordinary person

346
0:10:39,84 --> 0:10:41,32
you're not someone special

347
0:10:41,32 --> 0:10:44,58
not someone like Zong Qinghou, a renowned people's entrepreneur

348
0:10:44,58 --> 0:10:47,45
not the type who always travels in economy class

349
0:10:47,45 --> 0:10:48,69
not a moral showman

350
0:10:48,69 --> 0:10:49,69
you're not that kind of person

351
0:10:49,69 --> 0:10:50,9
right?

352
0:10:50,9 --> 0:10:50,93
So, to talk about it,

353
0:10:50,93 --> 0:10:52,7
you are just like Brother Rong,

354
0:10:52,7 --> 0:10:54,11
Brother Rong is just an ordinary person,

355
0:10:54,11 --> 0:10:56,3
an old man from Beijing,

356
0:10:56,3 --> 0:10:57,87
an old man with this level of understanding,

357
0:10:57,87 --> 0:11:1,66
so let's talk about the purpose of being frugal,

358
0:11:1,66 --> 0:11:6,829
frugality can truly slow down your steps to work,

359
0:11:6,829 --> 0:11:10,749
it can help you join the ranks of individual entrepreneurs and small business owners,

360
0:11:10,749 --> 0:11:13,99
this particular group.

361
0:11:13,99 --> 0:11:16,259
Don't let Brother Rong's talk fool you, as if he's in a terrible situation

362
0:11:16,259 --> 0:11:18,19
Many people just take a look at the live stream

363
0:11:18,19 --> 0:11:19,179
When they come to the live stream

364
0:11:19,179 --> 0:11:20,99
They see Brother Rong's place isn't decorated

365
0:11:20,99 --> 0:11:22,19
And they start to judge

366
0:11:22,19 --> 0:11:23,5
Assuming I must be broke

367
0:11:23,5 --> 0:11:24,15
Concluding I must be broke

368
0:11:24,15 --> 0:11:25,47
Yet I'm teaching others how to make money

369
0:11:25,47 --> 0:11:27,21
But I haven't really been teaching others how to make money

370
0:11:27,21 --> 0:11:27,73
Right?

371
0:11:27,73 --> 0:11:29,31
I'm just teaching people how to save money

372
0:11:29,31 --> 0:11:30,91
how to avoid falling into the trap of consumerism

373
0:11:30,91 --> 0:11:32,15
and then save that money

374
0:11:32,15 --> 0:11:33,21
to do more things

375
0:11:33,21 --> 0:11:35,37
but as for what these additional things are

376
0:11:35,37 --> 0:11:36,43
whether it's investing in real estate

377
0:11:36,43 --> 0:11:36,95
buying stocks

378
0:11:36,95 --> 0:11:39,3
trading futures, or purchasing U.S. stocks

379
0:11:39,3 --> 0:11:40,1
Trading Bitcoin

380
0:11:40,1 --> 0:11:42,36
or making various value investments

381
0:11:42,36 --> 0:11:43,58
is your own business

382
0:11:43,58 --> 0:11:44,8
I don’t have any recommendations

383
0:11:44,8 --> 0:11:46,92
I’m just telling you to save this money

384
0:11:46,92 --> 0:11:47,7
don’t go into debt

385
0:11:47,7 --> 0:11:49,1
so that’s the logic

386
0:11:49,1 --> 0:11:50,48
but in reality

387
0:11:50,48 --> 0:11:51,44
in this regard

388
0:11:51,44 --> 0:11:52,62
I'm not doing a great job either

389
0:11:52,62 --> 0:11:53,52
So we're telling you

390
0:11:53,52 --> 0:11:55,43
There's nothing at all

391
0:11:55,43 --> 0:11:57,86
It's useful before it becomes a product

392
0:11:57,86 --> 0:11:59,78
It means the money is in your hands

393
0:11:59,78 --> 0:12:1,66
Having your own cash flow is the safest

394
0:12:1,66 --> 0:12:2,86
When you hold onto something

395
0:12:2,86 --> 0:12:6,15
You have to bear the cost of holding it

396
0:12:6,15 --> 0:12:7,23
For example, buying these books

397
0:12:7,23 --> 0:12:12,69
These books have just been moved from the store's collection.

398
0:12:12,69 --> 0:12:13,269
The games I bought,

399
0:12:13,269 --> 0:12:15,89
I just bought some licenses,

400
0:12:15,89 --> 0:12:17,589
I just have the right to download them.

401
0:12:17,589 --> 0:12:18,469
If I don't play them,

402
0:12:18,469 --> 0:12:20,5
it's like the money was wasted.

403
0:12:20,5 --> 0:12:21,49
Right?

404
0:12:21,49 --> 0:12:24,21
All these things, the stuff I bought from Taobao,

405
0:12:24,21 --> 0:12:25,21
the things from Pinduoduo over the years,

406
0:12:25,21 --> 0:12:26,33
I didn't use them at the time,

407
0:12:26,33 --> 0:12:27,41
or I only used them once,

408
0:12:27,41 --> 0:12:30,729
and a lot of the time, the money was wasted.

409
0:12:30,729 --> 0:12:33,9
Like people like me,

410
0:12:33,9 --> 0:12:34,21
buying the Pocket 3,

411
0:12:34,21 --> 0:12:36,17
the Action 5 Pro,

412
0:12:36,17 --> 0:12:37,57
the G9,

413
0:12:37,57 --> 0:12:39,93
the G100, the M50,

414
0:12:39,93 --> 0:12:42,2
these are all cameras,

415
0:12:42,2 --> 0:12:45,2
and I can truly use them as productivity tools.

416
0:12:45,2 --> 0:12:47,56
Most people buy drones,

417
0:12:47,56 --> 0:12:50,75
buy cameras and only use them a few times,

418
0:12:50,75 --> 0:12:53,59
buy the G7X2,

419
0:12:53,59 --> 0:12:54,17
right?

420
0:12:54,17 --> 0:12:55,77
They're for taking beautiful American-style photos,

421
0:12:55,77 --> 0:12:58,94
where the girl holds the camera, which is a beauty camera,

422
0:12:58,94 --> 0:13:0,26
my ex-wife had one,

423
0:13:0,26 --> 0:13:2,86
my ex-girlfriend had one, and several others had them too,

424
0:13:2,86 --> 0:13:4,17
I bought two myself,

425
0:13:4,17 --> 0:13:6,53
they're for taking beautiful photos of women,

426
0:13:6,53 --> 0:13:7,53
and they're quite expensive,

427
0:13:7,53 --> 0:13:9,15
Xiaohongshu has made them even more expensive,

428
0:13:9,15 --> 0:13:10,65
originally a two to three thousand yuan item,

429
0:13:10,65 --> 0:13:12,21
now it's being hyped up to four to five thousand yuan.

430
0:13:12,21 --> 0:13:13,49
That's what it is.

431
0:13:13,49 --> 0:13:16,81
So you might think that in many cases, holding cash is better,

432
0:13:16,81 --> 0:13:17,53
you know,

433
0:13:17,53 --> 0:13:19,11
spend money where it counts,

434
0:13:19,11 --> 0:13:20,69
save up your money,

435
0:13:20,69 --> 0:13:23,6
and if the economy goes bad in the future,

436
0:13:23,6 --> 0:13:25,58
or if you're not in a good position for work in the future,

437
0:13:25,58 --> 0:13:26,94
you can sustain yourself long-term,

438
0:13:26,94 --> 0:13:28,4
keep yourself alive,

439
0:13:28,4 --> 0:13:29,88
until you find the secret to wealth.

440
0:13:29,88 --> 0:13:31,26
This is very important.

441
0:13:31,26 --> 0:13:34,84
So everyone should reflect on themselves,

442
0:13:34,84 --> 0:13:36,44
and see if you're like me,

443
0:13:36,44 --> 0:13:38,1
often falling for cheap deals,

444
0:13:38,1 --> 0:13:40,55
and buying unnecessary items to stockpile,

445
0:13:40,55 --> 0:13:42,84
that's a rat behavior.
