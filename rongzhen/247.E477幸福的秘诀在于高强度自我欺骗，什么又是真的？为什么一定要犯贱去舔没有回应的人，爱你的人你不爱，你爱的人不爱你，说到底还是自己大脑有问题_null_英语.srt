0:0:0,28 --> 0:0:0,92
Hello everyone

2
0:0:0,92 --> 0:0:1,64
At the beginning of the new year

3
0:0:1,64 --> 0:0:4,32
This is the first VLOG of 2025

4
0:0:4,32 --> 0:0:6,0
The first episode of Bed Chat

5
0:0:6,0 --> 0:0:8,32
In this episode, I want to talk about a really interesting topic

6
0:0:8,32 --> 0:0:12,57
It's about engaging in intense self-deception

7
0:0:12,57 --> 0:0:14,61
To ultimately achieve happiness

8
0:0:14,61 --> 0:0:16,5
What do I mean by that

9
0:0:16,5 --> 0:0:17,81
Check out the post I shared on my social media yesterday

10
0:0:17,81 --> 0:0:18,9
Let me tell you,

11
0:0:18,9 --> 0:0:21,36
I often watch videos from other UPloaders

12
0:0:21,36 --> 0:0:23,78
Then leave a comment and give a like

13
0:0:23,78 --> 0:0:25,549
practically groveling like a dog,

14
0:0:25,549 --> 0:0:27,749
but most of the time, these people don't return the favor by following me back.

15
0:0:27,749 --> 0:0:29,949
So, I usually unfollow them after a few days.

16
0:0:29,949 --> 0:0:31,929
Well, this is what I face with most UPloaders.

17
0:0:31,929 --> 0:0:34,65
This applies to those with more followers or fewer followers than me.

18
0:0:34,65 --> 0:0:36,53
My habit is being a follower.

19
0:0:36,53 --> 0:0:37,33
It doesn't matter.

20
0:0:37,33 --> 0:0:38,1
Generally speaking,

21
0:0:38,1 --> 0:0:38,83
You're the captain,

22
0:0:38,83 --> 0:0:40,43
What kind of premium Power Up member are you?

23
0:0:40,43 --> 0:0:40,95
What are you?

24
0:0:40,95 --> 0:0:43,27
Leave me a comment so we can interact more and maybe get on the engagement leaderboard,

25
0:0:43,27 --> 0:0:44,71
I always respond to my followers before the video.

26
0:0:44,71 --> 0:0:47,43
Everyone can see that I have a lot of followers on my Bilibili account.

27
0:0:47,43 --> 0:0:48,45
Posting on social media works the same way.

28
0:0:48,45 --> 0:0:49,47
I post on my Moments too.

29
0:0:49,47 --> 0:0:52,53
It's the same group of followers who give me likes every day.

30
0:0:52,53 --> 0:0:54,39
That makes me really happy.

31
0:0:54,39 --> 0:0:55,65
but the number of likes

32
0:0:55,65 --> 0:0:56,49
and the number of comments are just too many.

33
0:0:56,49 --> 0:0:57,98
Sometimes I can't even keep up.

34
0:0:57,98 --> 0:1:0,46
But if someone doesn't usually give me likes

35
0:1:0,46 --> 0:1:1,58
Suddenly gave me a like

36
0:1:1,58 --> 0:1:3,23
I'll be especially thrilled.

37
0:1:3,23 --> 0:1:4,27
Over time

38
0:1:4,27 --> 0:1:6,61
you'll notice people's behavior patterns

39
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:9,3
enter a predictable state

40
0:1:9,3 --> 0:1:12,62
which is why we often talk about pure love warriors and idealists

41
0:1:12,62 --> 0:1:16,1
because I used to be a pure love warrior and an idealist myself

42
0:1:16,1 --> 0:1:20,26
so when it comes to the judgment of good and evil in this world

43
0:1:20,26 --> 0:1:22,74
how I make these judgments of good and evil

44
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:24,84
is based on other people's reactions

45
0:1:24,84 --> 0:1:28,54
but let's say if your actions

46
0:1:28,54 --> 0:1:31,26
Behaviors are often judged by others' reactions.

47
0:1:31,26 --> 0:1:32,8
Your actions become predictable.

48
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:34,44
This makes you more susceptible to manipulation.

49
0:1:34,44 --> 0:1:35,35
Why is that?

50
0:1:35,35 --> 0:1:39,2
Because others only need to give you intermittent rewards.

51
0:1:39,2 --> 0:1:41,16
And the intervals between these rewards gradually increase.

52
0:1:41,16 --> 0:1:43,42
This is why, for example, your significant other might act in a certain way.

53
0:1:43,42 --> 0:1:44,56
Their mood swings can be unpredictable.

54
0:1:44,56 --> 0:1:46,51
Sometimes they can be really low and erratic.

55
0:1:46,51 --> 0:1:47,59
But you just like him

56
0:1:47,59 --> 0:1:49,3
It's like being in a state of torment

57
0:1:49,3 --> 0:1:50,43
What they call the gaslighting effect, right

58
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:51,83
He plays you and manipulates you

59
0:1:51,83 --> 0:1:52,6
That's how it is

60
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:54,92
His moods keep shifting

61
0:1:54,92 --> 0:1:56,84
Sometimes he's nice to you

62
0:1:56,84 --> 0:1:58,16
And other times he's not

63
0:1:58,16 --> 0:2:1,7
You gradually start to look forward to the next time he's nice to you

64
0:2:1,7 --> 0:2:5,98
But if your feedback mechanism for behavior changes,

65
0:2:5,98 --> 0:2:8,71
what's called random toxic responses,

66
0:2:8,71 --> 0:2:9,85
it leads to this,

67
0:2:9,85 --> 0:2:12,23
you have to engage in intense self-deception,

68
0:2:12,23 --> 0:2:13,45
no matter what,

69
0:2:13,45 --> 0:2:15,53
whether the other person hits you or insults you,

70
0:2:15,53 --> 0:2:16,33
or is kind to you,

71
0:2:16,33 --> 0:2:18,15
you feel that they must love you,

72
0:2:18,15 --> 0:2:19,53
at this point, you've entered a state where

73
0:2:19,53 --> 0:2:21,37
A state of self-hypnosis

74
0:2:21,37 --> 0:2:22,77
No matter if others hit you or scold you

75
0:2:22,77 --> 0:2:25,25
You think all these people are NPCs, huh?

76
0:2:25,25 --> 0:2:27,53
created for me to complete quests and earn rewards

77
0:2:27,53 --> 0:2:30,12
so I only need to focus on

78
0:2:30,12 --> 0:2:31,8
I am a legend

79
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:33,36
I am a chosen one

80
0:2:33,36 --> 0:2:34,72
Once you have this confidence

81
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:37,18
it can also become a real effect

82
0:2:37,18 --> 0:2:40,17
For example, when we talk about Comrade Trump

83
0:2:40,17 --> 0:2:42,33
Comrade Trump was born on June 14th

84
0:2:43,51 --> 0:2:47,34
I share the same birthday with many famous historical figures

85
0:2:47,34 --> 0:2:49,38
Why do I say I share the same birthday with Trump

86
0:2:49,38 --> 0:2:52,22
Because of the International Date Line on planet Earth

87
0:2:52,22 --> 0:2:54,52
Their June 14th is our June 15th

88
0:2:54,52 --> 0:2:56,0
So, in a mysterious way

89
0:2:56,0 --> 0:2:58,8
Trump still shares his birthday with many people

90
0:2:58,8 --> 0:3:0,16
But we, who share the same birthday on this day

91
0:3:0,16 --> 0:3:2,24
These people, being Geminis, are pretty unreliable.

92
0:3:2,24 --> 0:3:3,13
They're quite unreliable.

93
0:3:3,13 --> 0:3:7,53
But one trait of Geminis is that they don't easily fall into depression.

94
0:3:7,53 --> 0:3:8,81
They might cause others to feel depressed,

95
0:3:8,81 --> 0:3:10,17
but they don't get depressed themselves.

96
0:3:10,17 --> 0:3:13,53
We have this high-intensity way of deceiving both ourselves and others.

97
0:3:13,53 --> 0:3:14,13
the world around us.

98
0:3:14,13 --> 0:3:16,23
Actually, deceiving others isn't that hard,

99
0:3:16,23 --> 0:3:19,629
because, at the end of the day, one's identity in society is self-imposed.

100
0:3:19,629 --> 0:3:21,229
Whether you embellish it

101
0:3:21,229 --> 0:3:22,269
or belittle it

102
0:3:22,269 --> 0:3:23,69
no matter what

103
0:3:23,69 --> 0:3:25,8
if you don't express your true feelings

104
0:3:25,8 --> 0:3:26,94
it's essentially a form of performance

105
0:3:26,94 --> 0:3:32,7
However, many people don't understand the importance of self-love

106
0:3:32,7 --> 0:3:33,73
self-respect, self-love, and self-strengthening

107
0:3:33,73 --> 0:3:34,71
much of the time

108
0:3:34,71 --> 0:3:38,22
you can't make everyone like you

109
0:3:38,22 --> 0:3:41,66
So, all your life's efforts are to legitimize yourself.

110
0:3:41,66 --> 0:3:43,86
In the end, the result is that you've exhausted your energy.

111
0:3:43,86 --> 0:3:47,42
To make all those people in the world who you think are important

112
0:3:47,42 --> 0:3:48,72
care about you.

113
0:3:48,72 --> 0:3:51,32
But in reality, these people won't care about you.

114
0:3:51,32 --> 0:3:52,88
And the people who truly care about you,

115
0:3:52,88 --> 0:3:53,52
the ones who like you,

116
0:3:53,52 --> 0:3:54,4
will always like you,

117
0:3:54,4 --> 0:3:54,76
will always care about you.

118
0:3:54,76 --> 0:3:58,35
You think these people are insignificant.

119
0:3:58,35 --> 0:3:58,99
What's this called?

120
0:3:58,99 --> 0:4:0,39
This is being cheap.

121
0:4:0,39 --> 0:4:1,7
Just cheap.

122
0:4:1,7 --> 0:4:3,19
This person is just that cheap.

123
0:4:3,19 --> 0:4:5,539
You always think, what's the point of you liking me?

124
0:4:5,539 --> 0:4:6,839
The person I like doesn't like me back.

125
0:4:6,839 --> 0:4:9,5
Why should the person you like have to like you?

126
0:4:9,5 --> 0:4:10,23
That's the question.

127
0:4:10,23 --> 0:4:14,31
So you need to understand why you shouldn't deceive yourself.

128
0:4:14,31 --> 0:4:16,74
If you do deceive yourself,

129
0:4:16,74 --> 0:4:18,82
if you manage to fool yourself,

130
0:4:18,82 --> 0:4:20,76
you'll mess up your own feedback system.

131
0:4:20,76 --> 0:4:21,82
When someone criticizes you,

132
0:4:21,82 --> 0:4:23,64
you just laugh and say thanks.

133
0:4:23,64 --> 0:4:24,92
When someone compliments you,

134
0:4:24,92 --> 0:4:26,0
you ask why they're praising you,

135
0:4:26,0 --> 0:4:26,92
you know there's an ulterior motive.

136
0:4:26,92 --> 0:4:28,12
You want to go to bed?

137
0:4:28,12 --> 0:4:28,64
That's how it is.

138
0:4:28,64 --> 0:4:29,68
So no matter what,

139
0:4:29,68 --> 0:4:31,48
randomly being nice to someone,

140
0:4:31,48 --> 0:4:32,669
and then turning around to repay their kindness with ingratitude,

141
0:4:32,669 --> 0:4:35,369
and then being nice to someone who isn't good to you,

142
0:4:35,369 --> 0:4:37,22
offering this gift,

143
0:4:37,22 --> 0:4:39,98
making them wonder what's going on,

144
0:4:39,98 --> 0:4:42,89
and leaving them puzzled and abstracted.

145
0:4:42,89 --> 0:4:44,55
I think you're quite unfathomable.

146
0:4:44,55 --> 0:4:45,51
That's when you become invincible.

147
0:4:45,51 --> 0:4:48,88
So, often we say we deceive ourselves.

148
0:4:48,88 --> 0:4:52,0
We are the ones who most deserve to be deceived in this world.

149
0:4:52,0 --> 0:4:53,96
Because you're too self-conscious

150
0:4:53,96 --> 0:4:54,92
Excessive self-consciousness

151
0:4:54,92 --> 0:4:57,23
Often, this leads to chronic anxiety.

152
0:4:57,23 --> 0:4:59,17
Because you haven't accomplished anything significant.

153
0:4:59,17 --> 0:5:0,27
Then you start to feel like...

154
0:5:0,27 --> 0:5:1,59
But you can fool yourself, can't you?

155
0:5:1,59 --> 0:5:3,64
I'm doing something really big at home right now.

156
0:5:3,64 --> 0:5:4,56
I've planted this vegetable.

157
0:5:4,56 --> 0:5:5,44
Hey, I'm awesome.

158
0:5:5,44 --> 0:5:6,3
I am.

159
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:8,32
Grandpa Yuan Longping appeared to me in a dream.

160
0:5:8,32 --> 0:5:9,98
I'm the god of agriculture.

161
0:5:9,98 --> 0:5:12,82
A lot of the time, you shouldn't overthink things.

162
0:5:12,82 --> 0:5:13,98
I have to be a certain way.

163
0:5:13,98 --> 0:5:16,83
But I'm just fine even if I'm not great.

164
0:5:16,83 --> 0:5:18,27
A name that can be named is not a constant name.

165
0:5:18,27 --> 0:5:21,479
So, many times we say that if you understand more than one language,

166
0:5:21,479 --> 0:5:25,51
you'll know that 'name can be named' means 'define your name'.

167
0:5:25,51 --> 0:5:26,97
Define your name.

168
0:5:26,97 --> 0:5:29,55
It means you control the variable.

169
0:5:29,55 --> 0:5:32,3
You control the direction of the function.

170
0:5:32,3 --> 0:5:33,71
You define the function.

171
0:5:33,71 --> 0:5:35,35
This is commonly said in programming terms.

172
0:5:35,35 --> 0:5:37,86
Let's talk about how to define a function when calling it

173
0:5:37,86 --> 0:5:42,11
So you mean to define the name

174
0:5:42,11 --> 0:5:43,3
Define your name

175
0:5:43,3 --> 0:5:44,31
Define thy name

176
0:5:44,31 --> 0:5:44,75
Any of these works

177
0:5:44,75 --> 0:5:46,51
Regardless of whether you use Old English or not

178
0:5:46,51 --> 0:5:49,929
You're essentially giving something power

179
0:5:50,169 --> 0:5:51,749
So you just assign it randomly

180
0:5:51,749 --> 0:5:54,64
It's about breaking your own feedback loop

181
0:5:54,64 --> 0:5:56,42
Don't reward good and punish evil

182
0:5:56,42 --> 0:5:57,8
Don't just be nice

183
0:5:57,8 --> 0:5:58,68
to those who are nice to you

184
0:5:58,68 --> 0:5:59,52
and avoid those

185
0:5:59,52 --> 0:6:0,98
who aren't as kind

186
0:6:0,98 --> 0:6:2,54
This is indeed one approach

187
0:6:2,54 --> 0:6:3,86
but over time

188
0:6:3,86 --> 0:6:4,58
you'll realize

189
0:6:4,58 --> 0:6:7,549
that the people you expect to be nice to you might ignore you

190
0:6:7,549 --> 0:6:11,189
And the people you least expect, the ones you don't really pay attention to, might treat you very well.

191
0:6:11,189 --> 0:6:13,949
So this demonstrates a long-standing aspect of human nature.

192
0:6:13,949 --> 0:6:17,7
It's like you like AA, BB, and C.

193
0:6:17,7 --> 0:6:18,89
In the end, it might be C who likes you.

194
0:6:18,89 --> 0:6:20,64
C might like D, but it doesn't really matter.

195
0:6:20,64 --> 0:6:23,26
But the constant human pain lies in this very issue.

196
0:6:23,26 --> 0:6:26,85
It's the expectation that your efforts must be rewarded.

197
0:6:26,85 --> 0:6:28,81
Why must your efforts be rewarded?

198
0:6:28,81 --> 0:6:30,47
And why must the other person feel obligated to return the favor?

199
0:6:30,47 --> 0:6:31,79
If many people have put in effort for him,

200
0:6:31,79 --> 0:6:33,33
why should he feel obligated to return the favor specifically to you?

201
0:6:33,33 --> 0:6:35,29
Moreover, you told me about this mechanism,

202
0:6:35,29 --> 0:6:37,5
For example, everyone who gave me a like

203
0:6:37,5 --> 0:6:39,25
I can reply with a like at the touch of a button.

204
0:6:39,25 --> 0:6:40,29
Isn't that more convenient?

205
0:6:40,29 --> 0:6:43,409
But if you expect me to go through each person's profile one by one,

206
0:6:43,409 --> 0:6:44,209
He gave a like on his friend's post.

207
0:6:44,209 --> 0:6:45,249
wouldn't that be exhausting?

208
0:6:45,249 --> 0:6:47,89
When a lot of people like my posts on social media

209
0:6:47,89 --> 0:6:48,449
Do I go and like each of their posts in return?

210
0:6:48,449 --> 0:6:52,78
Not really, I only respond to those who I truly care about

211
0:6:52,78 --> 0:6:53,88
by replying to their messages

212
0:6:53,88 --> 0:6:55,36
Or you could give me a like.

213
0:6:55,36 --> 0:6:55,8
I feel really happy

214
0:6:55,8 --> 0:6:56,85
and I’ll chat with you for a bit

215
0:6:56,85 --> 0:6:57,73
It’s definitely like that

216
0:6:57,73 --> 0:6:59,13
So people are just fickle

217
0:6:59,13 --> 0:7:1,15
People are not equal.

218
0:7:1,15 --> 0:7:3,9
People's preferences are also not equal.

219
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:4,45
All these things are unequal.

220
0:7:4,45 --> 0:7:7,56
So, most importantly, you need to convince yourself.

221
0:7:7,56 --> 0:7:8,96
Why should others be good to me?

222
0:7:8,96 --> 0:7:10,68
Can't I be even better to them?

223
0:7:10,68 --> 0:7:11,28
When others are good to me,

224
0:7:11,28 --> 0:7:12,28
Do I have to be good to them in return?

225
0:7:12,28 --> 0:7:13,68
Can't I be a bit less nice to them?

226
0:7:13,68 --> 0:7:15,94
To test his sincerity

227
0:7:15,94 --> 0:7:18,34
Can't I be a little nicer to those who aren't nice to me?

228
0:7:18,34 --> 0:7:20,74
People who aren't nice to me expect me to be unkind back

229
0:7:20,74 --> 0:7:21,78
But if I suddenly treat them well

230
0:7:21,78 --> 0:7:22,58
They'll be surprised

231
0:7:22,58 --> 0:7:23,7
Why is this person like this?

232
0:7:23,7 --> 0:7:25,82
This person must really be Kogoro Mouri

233
0:7:27,82 --> 0:7:28,56
He's not afraid at all

234
0:7:28,56 --> 0:7:30,18
Kogoro Mouri is indeed not an ordinary person

235
0:7:30,18 --> 0:7:32,96
So often, you need to disrupt others' feedback mechanisms

236
0:7:32,96 --> 0:7:34,44
You need to break their preconceptions

237
0:7:35,44 --> 0:7:37,7
Many people suddenly get stunned by me

238
0:7:37,7 --> 0:7:38,66
It was supposed to be directed at me

239
0:7:38,66 --> 0:7:40,2
But then I say, 'Your suggestions are really great'

240
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:41,96
And I feel that your thoughts align with mine

241
0:7:41,96 --> 0:7:43,1
At this point, the other person exclaims

242
0:7:43,1 --> 0:7:44,82
This person is really unfathomable

243
0:7:44,82 --> 0:7:45,59
Scary

244
0:7:45,59 --> 0:7:48,17
Often, you might wonder why Liu Bang was able to conquer the empire

245
0:7:48,17 --> 0:7:49,63
why Liu Xiu was able to conquer the empire

246
0:7:49,63 --> 0:7:52,87
it’s because sometimes they would show great righteousness to those who were clearly their enemies

247
0:7:52,87 --> 0:7:54,65
and at other times, they would suddenly bestow heavy rewards on their deeply mysterious subordinates

248
0:7:54,65 --> 0:7:57,67
all of this is about being abstract

249
0:7:57,67 --> 0:7:59,87
as long as you are abstract enough

250
0:7:59,87 --> 0:8:2,38
as long as your actions are sufficiently enigmatic

251
0:8:5,74 --> 0:8:7,6
the other party won't be able to judge you

252
0:8:7,6 --> 0:8:9,3
and you also need to give yourself this kind of closed space

253
0:8:9,3 --> 0:8:9,86
this is why

254
0:8:9,86 --> 0:8:11,8
it's for your mental health

255
0:8:11,8 --> 0:8:13,36
we Geminis don't get depressed

256
0:8:13,36 --> 0:8:14,6
because we have two sides to ourselves

257
0:8:14,6 --> 0:8:16,4
we often talk to ourselves

258
0:8:16,4 --> 0:8:16,76
we won't feel lonely

259
0:8:16,76 --> 0:8:17,62
and we won't get depressed

260
0:8:17,62 --> 0:8:21,34
So often, we don't take ourselves too seriously

261
0:8:21,34 --> 0:8:23,26
Many personalities are like this

262
0:8:23,26 --> 0:8:25,34
The reason his issue gets complicated

263
0:8:25,34 --> 0:8:27,42
can fall into a self-critical cycle of personal growth

264
0:8:27,42 --> 0:8:28,46
Self-deprecation

265
0:8:28,46 --> 0:8:29,56
Excessive self-consciousness

266
0:8:29,56 --> 0:8:31,74
An excess of self-consciousness can be a truly terrifying thing.

267
0:8:31,74 --> 0:8:32,4
It's about your small

268
0:8:32,4 --> 0:8:33,68
My features are too heavy

269
0:8:33,68 --> 0:8:35,58
You place too much importance on gains and losses.

270
0:8:35,58 --> 0:8:37,48
Why do you care about glory and disgrace?

271
0:8:37,48 --> 0:8:38,52
In the end, we all die anyway.

272
0:8:38,52 --> 0:8:43,2
So why should you particularly care about fame and fortune?

273
0:8:43,2 --> 0:8:45,6
Even if he gets it, it won’t truly belong to you.

274
0:8:45,6 --> 0:8:46,96
It’s like the clothes you’re wearing.

275
0:8:46,96 --> 0:8:48,589
After all, you can always take them off, right?

276
0:8:48,589 --> 0:8:50,489
When it comes to all these things,

277
0:8:50,489 --> 0:8:51,809
they are all external possessions.

278
0:8:51,809 --> 0:8:53,12
Money is an external possession

279
0:8:53,12 --> 0:8:54,38
Fame is superficial

280
0:8:54,38 --> 0:8:55,84
Power fades when the person leaves

281
0:8:55,84 --> 0:8:56,72
All these things

282
0:8:56,72 --> 0:8:57,56
Although I tell you

283
0:8:57,56 --> 0:8:59,52
When you're young, you should pursue what you want

284
0:8:59,52 --> 0:9:0,76
They can exchange for many things

285
0:9:0,76 --> 0:9:2,32
They can bring you worldly happiness

286
0:9:2,32 --> 0:9:4,37
But in reality, they have no real meaning

287
0:9:4,37 --> 0:9:7,51
So don't seek positive feedback from others

288
0:9:7,51 --> 0:9:8,81
Give it to yourself

289
0:9:8,81 --> 0:9:11,87
Don't pursue anyone's praise for you

290
0:9:11,87 --> 0:9:14,98
You are much more handsome than Xu Gong

291
0:9:14,98 --> 0:9:17,16
You need to reinforce this psychological suggestion to yourself

292
0:9:17,16 --> 0:9:18,86
You need to love yourself

293
0:9:18,86 --> 0:9:21,38
You need to believe you're the best in the world

294
0:9:21,38 --> 0:9:22,14
I'm the best

295
0:9:22,14 --> 0:9:23,17
I'm the best

296
0:9:23,17 --> 0:9:24,45
I am the chosen one

297
0:9:24,45 --> 0:9:25,75
Even the heavens favor me

298
0:9:25,75 --> 0:9:26,91
Who the hell has wronged me

299
0:9:26,91 --> 0:9:28,99
May the heavens strike him with a bolt of lightning

300
0:9:28,99 --> 0:9:30,3
Right on his head

301
0:9:30,3 --> 0:9:31,25
You should think like this

302
0:9:31,25 --> 0:9:33,85
You must feel that you are Trump

303
0:9:33,85 --> 0:9:35,859
I am a legend

304
0:9:35,859 --> 0:9:37,539
A person like this is invincible

305
0:9:37,539 --> 0:9:40,739
You need to know that many entrepreneurs are actually narcissists.

306
0:9:40,739 --> 0:9:42,78
Why do narcissistic personality disorders

307
0:9:42,78 --> 0:9:44,22
and people with NPD

308
0:9:44,22 --> 0:9:45,5
become so strong?

309
0:9:45,5 --> 0:9:47,2
It’s because, apart from themselves,

310
0:9:47,2 --> 0:9:47,98
they can’t see anyone else.

311
0:9:47,98 --> 0:9:50,82
So, why is your self-esteem often weak?

312
0:9:50,82 --> 0:9:54,8
It’s because your parents in your early family life

313
0:9:54,8 --> 0:9:56,97
subjected you to various forms of psychological abuse.

314
0:9:56,97 --> 0:9:59,37
Making you feel like you have no self-worth

315
0:9:59,37 --> 0:10:0,9
So then

316
0:10:0,9 --> 0:10:2,25
Why do you pursue a sense of self-worth?

317
0:10:2,25 --> 0:10:5,32
It’s because you just want to gain your parents' love

318
0:10:5,32 --> 0:10:6,88
But your parents are really terrible people

319
0:10:6,88 --> 0:10:9,89
So don’t try to get it from your parents

320
0:10:9,89 --> 0:10:11,549
Instead, get it from your cyber godfathers online

321
0:10:11,549 --> 0:10:13,49
Not just from me, but from others as well

322
0:10:13,49 --> 0:10:14,729
How could this even happen, right?

323
0:10:14,729 --> 0:10:16,489
We should do it ourselves

324
0:10:16,489 --> 0:10:17,49
to be self-sufficient

325
0:10:17,49 --> 0:10:19,869
Why would I want praise from my enemy?

326
0:10:19,869 --> 0:10:21,449
An enemy wouldn’t praise me anyway

327
0:10:21,449 --> 0:10:22,609
Even if an enemy did praise me

328
0:10:22,609 --> 0:10:24,96
they would still try to eliminate me with an attack

329
0:10:24,96 --> 0:10:27,2
They might praise me after they’ve eliminated me

330
0:10:27,2 --> 0:10:29,15
because the enemy and I are in conflict

331
0:10:29,15 --> 0:10:31,83
Your relationship with some people’s parents is also a conflict

332
0:10:31,83 --> 0:10:33,95
The relationship between you and the person you're pursuing is also a conflict of interests.

333
0:10:33,95 --> 0:10:35,31
He might have many admirers.

334
0:10:35,31 --> 0:10:38,25
Your parents may just want to send you off sooner.

335
0:10:38,25 --> 0:10:40,11
He feels that you're causing trouble in his life.

336
0:10:40,11 --> 0:10:40,91
In reality, you're a burden.

337
0:10:40,91 --> 0:10:41,91
He should have loved you.

338
0:10:41,91 --> 0:10:44,2
but hasn't given you enough attention

339
0:10:44,2 --> 0:10:45,4
Enough reciprocation.

340
0:10:45,4 --> 0:10:45,8
Enough contribution.

341
0:10:45,8 --> 0:10:46,92
Not giving you enough love

342
0:10:46,92 --> 0:10:48,14
That's because he's a jerk

343
0:10:48,14 --> 0:10:49,8
There's a conflict between you two

344
0:10:49,8 --> 0:10:50,68
A conflict

345
0:10:50,68 --> 0:10:53,109
Why do you insist on getting an award from your enemy?

346
0:10:53,109 --> 0:10:55,69
So isn't the issue with you?

347
0:10:55,69 --> 0:10:56,669
So your approach is flawed

348
0:10:56,669 --> 0:10:57,769
You should love yourself

349
0:10:57,769 --> 0:11:0,68
The essence of loving yourself is about fooling yourself

350
0:11:0,68 --> 0:11:2,42
It's about deceiving yourself

351
0:11:2,42 --> 0:11:4,6
But then, what is reality?

352
0:11:4,6 --> 0:11:6,1
Aren't you the most adorable person?

353
0:11:6,1 --> 0:11:8,34
Aren't you the most important person in this universe?

354
0:11:8,34 --> 0:11:10,75
Because you are the most important in your universe.

355
0:11:10,75 --> 0:11:12,11
Your universe begins with you.

356
0:11:12,11 --> 0:11:12,67
And ends with you.

357
0:11:12,67 --> 0:11:13,83
After you pass away,

358
0:11:13,83 --> 0:11:14,51
how others criticize you

359
0:11:14,51 --> 0:11:15,71
You can't hear anymore either.

360
0:11:15,71 --> 0:11:17,35
You don't know how your loved ones are doing.

361
0:11:17,35 --> 0:11:18,45
You don't know anymore.

362
0:11:18,45 --> 0:11:20,1
So your life is over.

363
0:11:20,1 --> 0:11:22,41
Why do you care about those deep comments?

364
0:11:22,41 --> 0:11:23,41
Right, so it's meaningless.

365
0:11:23,41 --> 0:11:26,63
So you should make your life the top priority.

366
0:11:26,63 --> 0:11:29,31
Don't chase after others' likes

367
0:11:29,31 --> 0:11:31,23
Don't seek others' follow-backs.

368
0:11:31,23 --> 0:11:33,21
Don’t go chasing after other people’s approval

369
0:11:33,21 --> 0:11:34,95
There’s no smoke without fire

370
0:11:34,95 --> 0:11:36,25
He’s always looking for you

371
0:11:36,25 --> 0:11:37,13
It can’t be anything good

372
0:11:37,13 --> 0:11:37,85
It’s either mischief or theft

373
0:11:37,85 --> 0:11:40,24
Isn’t he just after the old lady’s money?

374
0:11:40,24 --> 0:11:40,72
Right?

375
0:11:40,72 --> 0:11:42,76
So in many cases, it’s bound to be nothing good

376
0:11:42,76 --> 0:11:43,64
Or else he wants to borrow money from you

377
0:11:43,64 --> 0:11:44,48
Or I'll mess with you

378
0:11:44,48 --> 0:11:46,2
Or I'll mess with you and take your money too

379
0:11:46,2 --> 0:11:46,8
So it's always like this

380
0:11:46,8 --> 0:11:48,52
Isn't it all about mutual deception between men and women

381
0:11:48,52 --> 0:11:50,76
Satisfying our own hormonal sexual desires

382
0:11:50,76 --> 0:11:53,36
So in the end, what's all this talk about love

383
0:11:53,36 --> 0:11:54,16
It ends up being a mess

384
0:11:54,16 --> 0:11:55,32
With child support and all sorts of issues

385
0:11:55,32 --> 0:11:56,36
Divorces, remarriages, and everything else

386
0:11:56,36 --> 0:11:58,3
These things are just repetitive.

387
0:11:58,3 --> 0:11:59,5
You realize they're all the same.

388
0:11:59,5 --> 0:12:0,49
So you have to deceive yourself.

389
0:12:0,49 --> 0:12:2,27
My goddess

390
0:12:2,27 --> 0:12:4,31
they're just too shy to tell me.

391
0:12:4,31 --> 0:12:5,91
He actually loves me.

392
0:12:5,91 --> 0:12:6,47
You know?

393
0:12:6,47 --> 0:12:7,78
So you have to deceive yourself.

394
0:12:7,78 --> 0:12:8,78
You need to deceive yourself.

395
0:12:8,78 --> 0:12:10,54
I'm the most useful person in this world.

396
0:12:10,54 --> 0:12:12,56
I can succeed wherever I go.

397
0:12:12,56 --> 0:12:14,28
Problems get solved wherever I am.

398
0:12:14,28 --> 0:12:15,48
But you can fool yourself.

399
0:12:15,48 --> 0:12:17,7
Aside from not stepping into minefields.

400
0:12:17,7 --> 0:12:19,7
You can do anything you want.

401
0:12:19,7 --> 0:12:21,9
You give yourself a hundred percent confidence.

402
0:12:21,9 --> 0:12:23,82
You constantly cheer yourself on and boost your morale.

403
0:12:23,82 --> 0:12:24,94
Just like when you play Gundam games.

404
0:12:24,94 --> 0:12:25,66
Playing anything

405
0:12:25,66 --> 0:12:27,22
Others cheer you on

406
0:12:27,22 --> 0:12:27,86
You always rely on

407
0:12:27,86 --> 0:12:28,58
I'll cheer you on

408
0:12:28,58 --> 0:12:29,18
I'm the healer

409
0:12:29,18 --> 0:12:30,89
I'm the support

410
0:12:30,89 --> 0:12:31,529
If you can heal yourself

411
0:12:31,529 --> 0:12:32,549
Wouldn't that be awesome

412
0:12:32,549 --> 0:12:34,929
If a character can take down others

413
0:12:34,929 --> 0:12:35,849
You can heal yourself

414
0:12:35,849 --> 0:12:36,74
Isn't that awesome?

415
0:12:36,74 --> 0:12:38,66
So the most important thing is to heal yourself

416
0:12:38,66 --> 0:12:39,92
Healing yourself

417
0:12:39,92 --> 0:12:42,28
Are you really going to push it that far?

418
0:12:42,28 --> 0:12:43,32
Climbed Mount Tai

419
0:12:43,32 --> 0:12:44,51
Visited the Great Wall

420
0:12:44,51 --> 0:12:46,5
You climbed the steps

421
0:12:46,5 --> 0:12:47,45
And then you went skydiving

422
0:12:47,45 --> 0:12:48,73
Then I went paragliding

423
0:12:48,73 --> 0:12:50,7
Then that person landed on the moon

424
0:12:50,7 --> 0:12:52,7
Are you the one who has value?

425
0:12:52,7 --> 0:12:52,88
No, not at all

426
0:12:52,88 --> 0:12:55,32
I was born feeling that I am a valuable person

427
0:12:55,32 --> 0:12:56,32
And I further through

428
0:12:56,32 --> 0:12:58,44
Later, whether it was a small achievement or a big one

429
0:12:58,44 --> 0:13:0,5
I would reinforce this impression

430
0:13:0,5 --> 0:13:2,1
But no matter how the world responds to me

431
0:13:2,1 --> 0:13:3,7
I always love myself

432
0:13:3,7 --> 0:13:6,3
No matter how dark this society may be to me

433
0:13:6,3 --> 0:13:6,94
No matter how many blows

434
0:13:6,94 --> 0:13:8,56
I know I am a person of value

435
0:13:8,56 --> 0:13:11,849
I am destined to achieve something great in this life

436
0:13:11,849 --> 0:13:13,9
Even if I don’t accomplish great things

437
0:13:13,9 --> 0:13:13,769
I’ll come back in the next life

438
0:13:13,769 --> 0:13:14,169
It’s okay

439
0:13:14,169 --> 0:13:15,129
Let’s just enjoy this life

440
0:13:15,129 --> 0:13:16,89
Let's just take a cursory look

441
0:13:16,89 --> 0:13:16,849
Let's just demo it

442
0:13:16,849 --> 0:13:18,829
So what if it's just a preview version

443
0:13:18,829 --> 0:13:19,89
Right?

444
0:13:19,89 --> 0:13:23,5
So you need to break this cycle in your mind

445
0:13:23,5 --> 0:13:25,27
You need to set high goals for yourself

446
0:13:25,27 --> 0:13:28,73
It's not about how strict you are with yourself

447
0:13:28,73 --> 0:13:31,13
It's because you haven't received enough love

448
0:13:31,41 --> 0:13:32,83
You haven't received enough love

449
0:13:32,83 --> 0:13:35,75
So you always try to achieve high-value goals

450
0:13:35,75 --> 0:13:37,47
to earn your parents' love

451
0:13:37,47 --> 0:13:39,21
but your parents are just terrible

452
0:13:39,21 --> 0:13:40,27
they won’t give it to you

453
0:13:40,27 --> 0:13:42,5
they treat you like they’re training a dog

454
0:13:42,5 --> 0:13:45,6
you’re just a dog in the Panhong Park

455
0:13:45,6 --> 0:13:46,9
so how could you be happy

456
0:13:46,9 --> 0:13:47,44
right

457
0:13:47,44 --> 0:13:48,9
his goal is to domesticate you

458
0:13:48,9 --> 0:13:50,39
Don't let him harm you

459
0:13:50,39 --> 0:13:51,91
or harm himself

460
0:13:51,91 --> 0:13:53,39
You don't harm your parents

461
0:13:53,39 --> 0:13:55,99
This is the best application of filial piety

462
0:13:55,99 --> 0:13:57,11
But if your parents harm you

463
0:13:57,11 --> 0:14:0,36
You have no way out

464
0:14:0,36 --> 0:14:1,76
If your parents bully you

465
0:14:1,76 --> 0:14:2,52
Is that called bullying

466
0:14:2,52 --> 0:14:4,18
That's called normal education

467
0:14:4,18 --> 0:14:5,2
This is normal.

468
0:14:5,2 --> 0:14:7,4
That's the most terrifying aspect of filial piety culture.

469
0:14:7,4 --> 0:14:8,78
It's one-sided suffering.

470
0:14:8,78 --> 0:14:9,74
There's no way to control it.

471
0:14:9,74 --> 0:14:11,36
You haven't seen in mental hospitals,

472
0:14:11,36 --> 0:14:13,41
parents driven mad by their children.

473
0:14:13,41 --> 0:14:15,49
You only see children driven mad by their parents.

474
0:14:15,49 --> 0:14:18,44
I just watched all the UPloaders who passed away in 2024.

475
0:14:18,44 --> 0:14:20,68
Most of them couldn't see a way out.

476
0:14:20,68 --> 0:14:22,68
If we can't figure it out, let's break this mechanism.

477
0:14:22,68 --> 0:14:25,72
If we can't figure it out, let's switch to a new method for our operating system.

478
0:14:25,72 --> 0:14:26,88
Let's change our mindset.

479
0:14:26,88 --> 0:14:31,99
This intense hope is the path to artificial life.

480
0:14:31,99 --> 0:14:34,19
Artificial life and happiness.

481
0:14:34,19 --> 0:14:35,1
It's a necessary journey.

482
0:14:35,1 --> 0:14:36,1
Trust me.

483
0:14:36,1 --> 0:14:36,89
No matter what.

484
0:14:36,89 --> 0:14:37,89
People are at their lowest when they have no dignity.

485
0:14:37,89 --> 0:14:38,79
People become invincible when they have no shame.

486
0:14:38,79 --> 0:14:39,61
Unstoppable in the world.

487
0:14:39,61 --> 0:14:40,51
What is dignity?

488
0:14:40,51 --> 0:14:42,51
What is truth?

489
0:14:42,79 --> 0:14:44,39
The world is all illusions.

490
0:14:44,39 --> 0:14:45,59
What is real?

491
0:14:45,59 --> 0:14:46,73
You deceive yourself.

492
0:14:46,73 --> 0:14:48,69
Aren't you really very cute?

493
0:14:48,69 --> 0:14:49,61
You are very cute.

494
0:14:49,61 --> 0:14:50,67
You are amazing.

495
0:14:50,67 --> 0:14:52,6
So don't worry about all that nonsense.

496
0:14:52,6 --> 0:14:53,4
I say you're great.

497
0:14:53,4 --> 0:14:54,12
You are great.

498
0:14:54,12 --> 0:14:54,68
When I say you're great.

499
0:14:54,68 --> 0:14:55,2
You are great.

500
0:14:55,2 --> 0:14:56,37
Even if you're not, you are.

501
0:14:56,37 --> 0:14:58,45
But why do you give me this power?

502
0:14:58,45 --> 0:15:1,17
Why do you give me the right to name you?

503
0:15:1,17 --> 0:15:2,53
You need to define yourself.

504
0:15:2,53 --> 0:15:3,43
To surprise everyone.

505
0:15:3,43 --> 0:15:4,69
The most important thing is to define.

506
0:15:4,69 --> 0:15:8,0
It's not about the fees you display.

507
0:15:8,0 --> 0:15:10,8
It's not about the reputation you show.

508
0:15:10,8 --> 0:15:12,2
It's not about the achievements you make.

509
0:15:12,2 --> 0:15:15,79
It's about loving yourself naturally.

510
0:15:15,79 --> 0:15:16,679
Heaven brought me into this world.

511
0:15:16,679 --> 0:15:17,799
God must really love me

512
0:15:17,799 --> 0:15:18,159
Right?

513
0:15:18,159 --> 0:15:19,7
So you are a part of Heaven.

514
0:15:19,7 --> 0:15:21,3
So names that can be named are not true names.

515
0:15:21,3 --> 0:15:22,38
The way that can be spoken is not the true way.

516
0:15:22,38 --> 0:15:24,62
You need to define your own life.

517
0:15:24,62 --> 0:15:27,46
I am already complete today.

518
0:15:27,46 --> 0:15:28,7
How can there be any debt?

519
0:15:28,7 --> 0:15:32,3
I am already in a state of perfect completeness.

520
0:15:32,3 --> 0:15:33,66
Why should I seek perfection?

521
0:15:33,66 --> 0:15:36,8
I am already in a perfect state.

522
0:15:36,8 --> 0:15:37,54
I am Maitreya Buddha in the world.

523
0:15:37,54 --> 0:15:38,829
I am the future.

524
0:15:38,829 --> 0:15:39,789
The future again.

525
0:15:39,789 --> 0:15:40,669
The present as well.

526
0:15:40,669 --> 0:15:42,129
Having seen the future, why should I fail?

527
0:15:42,129 --> 0:15:42,8
That's how it is.

528
0:15:42,8 --> 0:15:44,8
So our future will definitely lead to completeness.

529
0:15:44,8 --> 0:15:46,28
Why should we care about imperfections in the process?

530
0:15:46,28 --> 0:15:48,94
Why should we worry about anything less than perfect?

531
0:15:48,94 --> 0:15:49,76
So love yourself.

532
0:15:49,76 --> 0:15:51,6
Starting today.
