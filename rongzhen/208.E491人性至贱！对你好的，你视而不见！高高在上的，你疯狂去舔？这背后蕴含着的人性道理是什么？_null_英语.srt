1
0:0:0,12 --> 0:0:1,78
The mattress is 490 altogether.

2
0:0:1,78 --> 0:0:3,46
I adjusted the camera settings a bit.

3
0:0:3,46 --> 0:0:5,21
I tweaked the angle of the light.

4
0:0:5,21 --> 0:0:6,57
The effect might be great.

5
0:0:6,57 --> 0:0:7,71
But who knows?

6
0:0:7,71 --> 0:0:9,49
I just posted something on my Moments.

7
0:0:9,49 --> 0:0:10,89
After posting it on my Moments,

8
0:0:10,89 --> 0:0:12,25
I suddenly had a feeling,

9
0:0:12,25 --> 0:0:15,51
It's something I wanted to share with all of you.

10
0:0:15,51 --> 0:0:17,55
Quite often, I give likes to some people

11
0:0:17,55 --> 0:0:19,3
whom I really like

12
0:0:19,3 --> 0:0:21,78
but they don't return the favor

13
0:0:21,78 --> 0:0:24,1
However, I post on my Moments every day

14
0:0:24,1 --> 0:0:26,18
and there are always some regular followers who like my posts

15
0:0:26,18 --> 0:0:27,63
Sometimes I go back and like theirs too

16
0:0:27,63 --> 0:0:29,63
Why does this happen?

17
0:0:29,63 --> 0:0:31,57
What does this situation actually mean?

18
0:0:31,57 --> 0:0:34,73
Often, we say when someone gives you a like

19
0:0:34,73 --> 0:0:35,89
This value is different.

20
0:0:35,89 --> 0:0:37,9
If it's someone you like,

21
0:0:37,9 --> 0:0:37,65
who gives you a like,

22
0:0:37,65 --> 0:0:39,9
you'd be particularly happy.

23
0:0:39,9 --> 0:0:41,3
If it's someone you admire,

24
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:42,7
someone you really care about,

25
0:0:42,7 --> 0:0:42,91
and they give you a like,

26
0:0:42,91 --> 0:0:43,83
it means they're really pleased.

27
0:0:43,83 --> 0:0:45,11
But for everyone,

28
0:0:45,11 --> 0:0:46,37
Let's start with this

29
0:0:46,37 --> 0:0:49,21
Everyone has a different value in others' hearts

30
0:0:49,21 --> 0:0:50,9
I have many friends

31
0:0:50,9 --> 0:0:51,41
I keep giving him likes every day

32
0:0:51,41 --> 0:0:53,57
but he might have blocked me long ago

33
0:0:53,57 --> 0:0:55,23
or never checks my feed

34
0:0:55,23 --> 0:0:58,97
or it could be that among his friends

35
0:0:58,97 --> 0:1:0,75
I only make up a tiny fraction

36
0:1:0,75 --> 0:1:2,55
just like you are in my circle of friends

37
0:1:2,55 --> 0:1:4,27
I have about 5 per thousand left.

38
0:1:4,27 --> 0:1:6,55
But now all three of my accounts are full.

39
0:1:6,55 --> 0:1:8,11
So it might be 15 per thousand.

40
0:1:8,11 --> 0:1:10,1
So I might not even know you.

41
0:1:10,1 --> 0:1:11,26
I don’t know you exist.

42
0:1:11,26 --> 0:1:13,26
This is also a result of Brother Rong’s mistake.

43
0:1:13,26 --> 0:1:14,58
A really big mistake.

44
0:1:14,58 --> 0:1:16,79
So the people who can see my Moments now,

45
0:1:16,79 --> 0:1:17,95
are those who added my main account.

46
0:1:17,95 --> 0:1:19,99
But I do have an assistant now, don't I?

47
0:1:19,99 --> 0:1:22,1
My assistant will later post all my Moments

48
0:1:22,1 --> 0:1:23,5
to my secondary account.

49
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:25,74
This way, I can manage everything myself.

50
0:1:25,74 --> 0:1:27,5
But they say I cry every day,

51
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:29,86
posting so many Moments,

52
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:30,98
like a pyramid scheme marketer.

53
0:1:30,98 --> 0:1:32,67
That's not a big deal.

54
0:1:32,67 --> 0:1:35,81
The most important thing is not to take it too seriously.

55
0:1:35,81 --> 0:1:38,77
Whether others will praise you is a matter of perspective.

56
0:1:38,77 --> 0:1:40,75
This means it's a mindset issue.

57
0:1:40,75 --> 0:1:41,84
We often say,

58
0:1:41,84 --> 0:1:43,4
If your love,

59
0:1:43,4 --> 0:1:45,1
Your efforts are all aimed at getting something in return,

60
0:1:45,1 --> 0:1:49,49
This can put you in a vulnerable position.

61
0:1:49,49 --> 0:1:52,76
Because often, giving and loving don't always yield returns.

62
0:1:52,76 --> 0:1:54,12
But I'm not suggesting that

63
0:1:54,12 --> 0:1:55,97
You should give endlessly without bounds.

64
0:1:55,97 --> 0:1:57,13
As a provider

65
0:1:57,13 --> 0:1:58,19
That's not what I mean

66
0:1:58,19 --> 0:2:3,22
Your love and effort should be randomly directed at some people

67
0:2:3,22 --> 0:2:4,8
Why am I telling you this

68
0:2:4,8 --> 0:2:7,83
This random chance is not worth someone who doesn’t deserve your affection

69
0:2:7,83 --> 0:2:9,73
No matter how good you are to them, it’s useless

70
0:2:9,73 --> 0:2:12,71
Especially people like the UPloaders I know

71
0:2:12,71 --> 0:2:14,63
Or particularly famous and wealthy individuals

72
0:2:14,63 --> 0:2:15,589
People in power

73
0:2:15,589 --> 0:2:20,529
These people often receive a lot of likes from others

74
0:2:20,529 --> 0:2:21,56
who praise them

75
0:2:21,56 --> 0:2:23,16
no matter what nonsense they post

76
0:2:23,16 --> 0:2:24,1
there will always be someone to praise them

77
0:2:24,1 --> 0:2:25,12
but I'm different

78
0:2:25,12 --> 0:2:26,96
if what I post is really nonsense

79
0:2:26,96 --> 0:2:28,349
people won't pay attention to it

80
0:2:28,349 --> 0:2:29,629
but when they find something reasonable

81
0:2:29,629 --> 0:2:30,959
they will give me likes

82
0:2:30,959 --> 0:2:34,259
So, my goal in posting on social media is to gather positive feedback.

83
0:2:34,259 --> 0:2:34,799
What kind of thing?

84
0:2:34,799 --> 0:2:35,379
What topic?

85
0:2:35,379 --> 0:2:37,679
What really resonates with people?

86
0:2:37,679 --> 0:2:40,16
Then I focus on creating content around those topics.

87
0:2:40,16 --> 0:2:40,96
Also,

88
0:2:40,96 --> 0:2:45,7
It helps me predict the future views of the upload.

89
0:2:45,7 --> 0:2:46,67
But in most cases,

90
0:2:46,67 --> 0:2:50,29
I really have no idea what the outcome will be.

91
0:2:50,29 --> 0:2:51,48
So, let's talk about it.

92
0:2:51,48 --> 0:2:54,64
There are many people you don't need to flatter at all.

93
0:2:54,64 --> 0:2:58,83
And there's no need to predict whether she will favor you.

94
0:2:58,83 --> 0:3:0,5
For example, if you have a crush.

95
0:3:0,5 --> 0:3:0,99
Whatever you post on your social media,

96
0:3:0,99 --> 0:3:2,78
it's all to catch her attention.

97
0:3:2,78 --> 0:3:3,86
If she suddenly gives you a like,

98
0:3:3,86 --> 0:3:4,8
you can be happy for days.

99
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:6,3
But she did give you a like.

100
0:3:6,3 --> 0:3:8,62
Does that prove your strengths are equal?

101
0:3:8,62 --> 0:3:10,26
Your strengths are still not on par.

102
0:3:10,26 --> 0:3:11,38
The gap in your looks

103
0:3:11,38 --> 0:3:12,46
The gap in financial conditions

104
0:3:12,46 --> 0:3:13,68
The gap in height

105
0:3:13,68 --> 0:3:15,0
And the gap in personalities

106
0:3:15,0 --> 0:3:16,12
Will never be bridged.

107
0:3:16,12 --> 0:3:19,75
So don't try to get a return from others.

108
0:3:19,75 --> 0:3:22,63
If you don't try to get a return from others

109
0:3:22,63 --> 0:3:25,19
False responses from others won't throw you off.

110
0:3:25,19 --> 0:3:27,6
Let's be real, many female streamers

111
0:3:27,6 --> 0:3:29,12
will occasionally give you some perks

112
0:3:29,12 --> 0:3:29,8
or say a word to you

113
0:3:29,8 --> 0:3:31,0
and you'll be over the moon

114
0:3:31,0 --> 0:3:32,38
then you'll coolly shower them with coins

115
0:3:32,38 --> 0:3:35,11
and these female streamers mostly rely on this to survive

116
0:3:35,11 --> 0:3:39,1
so there's no need to restrict yourself just to get such responses

117
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:41,95
and hold back on what you want to do

118
0:3:41,95 --> 0:3:45,46
And often, I don't care about the returns.

119
0:3:45,46 --> 0:3:46,18
Who are they?

120
0:3:46,18 --> 0:3:47,68
They are people with social resources.

121
0:3:47,68 --> 0:3:50,52
They often won't be interested in your likes.

122
0:3:50,52 --> 0:3:52,0
But if you pay them,

123
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:53,28
they will serve you.

124
0:3:53,28 --> 0:3:53,88
They will go all out for you.

125
0:3:53,88 --> 0:3:54,4
It's quite normal.

126
0:3:54,4 --> 0:3:55,99
Everyone has their price.

127
0:3:55,99 --> 0:3:57,83
The reason I know these people

128
0:3:57,83 --> 0:3:59,75
is sometimes due to a recommendation

129
0:3:59,75 --> 0:4:2,23
or because I'm aware of some of their insights

130
0:4:2,23 --> 0:4:3,69
which have been helpful to me

131
0:4:3,69 --> 0:4:6,5
So, the purpose of keeping these people in my contacts

132
0:4:6,5 --> 0:4:7,27
is to admire them

133
0:4:7,27 --> 0:4:9,25
and to learn from them

134
0:4:9,25 --> 0:4:12,16
the qualities I lack

135
0:4:12,16 --> 0:4:15,32
and I can't receive such kind of positive feedback from them

136
0:4:15,32 --> 0:4:16,2
This is quite normal.

137
0:4:16,2 --> 0:4:18,7
Because these people receive so much kindness.

138
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:20,56
So, this gives you two insights.

139
0:4:20,56 --> 0:4:24,72
One is that if you don't worry about whether you get anything in return,

140
0:4:24,72 --> 0:4:27,28
then your true goal should be to learn what you need from each person,

141
0:4:27,28 --> 0:4:28,48
and absorb it for yourself.

142
0:4:28,48 --> 0:4:29,6
Then make it your own.

143
0:4:29,6 --> 0:4:30,86
This is what will truly benefit you.

144
0:4:30,86 --> 0:4:35,29
Secondly, you can respond to these people randomly.

145
0:4:35,29 --> 0:4:36,59
When you reply to these people

146
0:4:36,59 --> 0:4:37,61
We should say

147
0:4:37,61 --> 0:4:39,2
From a pragmatic perspective

148
0:4:39,2 --> 0:4:42,46
People who like you and people you like can both be attractive

149
0:4:42,46 --> 0:4:46,5
People who like you aren't necessarily less attractive than the people you like

150
0:4:46,5 --> 0:4:49,4
So much of the time, this is an unequal dynamic

151
0:4:49,4 --> 0:4:50,88
When you desire something

152
0:4:50,88 --> 0:4:52,28
That you consider crucial

153
0:4:52,28 --> 0:4:54,0
You subconsciously put a filter on her in your mind

154
0:4:54,0 --> 0:4:55,4
You should up the ante

155
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:55,6
She's my goddess

156
0:4:55,6 --> 0:4:56,6
I really like her

157
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:57,8
This way, you get a response

158
0:4:57,8 --> 0:4:58,56
You'll be over the moon

159
0:4:58,56 --> 0:4:59,96
But what do you have to give up?

160
0:4:59,96 --> 0:5:1,6
You'll buy gold coins for him

161
0:5:1,6 --> 0:5:3,299
You'll put in a lot of genuine effort

162
0:5:3,299 --> 0:5:4,299
However, when it comes to this

163
0:5:4,299 --> 0:5:5,499
You won't get the corresponding return

164
0:5:5,499 --> 0:5:7,39
due to the gap between you

165
0:5:7,39 --> 0:5:8,239
the positional difference

166
0:5:8,239 --> 0:5:10,299
the disparity in strength still exists

167
0:5:10,299 --> 0:5:12,919
so there's no need to pay a price

168
0:5:12,919 --> 0:5:14,79
just to get a response from others

169
0:5:14,79 --> 0:5:16,499
but when you do respond to others

170
0:5:16,499 --> 0:5:17,99
it can make them overjoyed

171
0:5:17,99 --> 0:5:19,83
this is the disparity in status between the two of you

172
0:5:19,83 --> 0:5:20,99
The existence of potential energy

173
0:5:20,99 --> 0:5:23,15
When high potential energy moves towards lower potential energy

174
0:5:23,15 --> 0:5:24,98
it creates a gradient effect

175
0:5:24,98 --> 0:5:26,68
Water flows downhill, right?

176
0:5:26,68 --> 0:5:27,86
Heavy objects fall downward

177
0:5:27,86 --> 0:5:29,1
So, in all these cases

178
0:5:29,1 --> 0:5:31,26
you should leverage this potential energy to get things done

179
0:5:31,26 --> 0:5:33,9
Don't beg your teachers or mentors

180
0:5:33,9 --> 0:5:35,42
or those who are more accomplished than you

181
0:5:35,42 --> 0:5:37,34
I can give you a normal, reciprocal response

182
0:5:37,34 --> 0:5:38,94
because the relationship between you is inherently unequal

183
0:5:38,94 --> 0:5:40,789
so don't aim for equality

184
0:5:40,789 --> 0:5:43,189
because once the other party pretends to be equal with you

185
0:5:43,189 --> 0:5:44,269
they definitely have an ulterior motive

186
0:5:44,269 --> 0:5:45,589
or want to take advantage of you

187
0:5:45,589 --> 0:5:46,349
that’s when they would do it

188
0:5:46,349 --> 0:5:48,2
so pursuing this feeling

189
0:5:48,2 --> 0:5:50,8
will instead put you in an unbeatable position

190
0:5:50,8 --> 0:5:51,8
a disadvantageous position

191
0:5:51,8 --> 0:5:52,72
When should you secure an unbeatable position?

192
0:5:52,72 --> 0:5:56,2
It's about how you respond to the people around you, those who like you

193
0:5:56,2 --> 0:5:59,4
A sufficiently kind response is enough

194
0:5:59,4 --> 0:6:1,85
There's no need to fantasize about winning the love of a goddess

195
0:6:1,85 --> 0:6:4,41
But the love of female followers is always within your reach

196
0:6:4,41 --> 0:6:5,67
I'm just joking around

197
0:6:5,67 --> 0:6:8,78
But often, I tell you, the value in human relationships

198
0:6:8,78 --> 0:6:9,98
depends on your own preferences

199
0:6:9,98 --> 0:6:11,18
Because you want to lick whoever you want

200
0:6:11,18 --> 0:6:11,8
admire whoever you want

201
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:16,17
you may misjudge their value in many ways

202
0:6:16,17 --> 0:6:20,34
my female followers are actually much wealthier than me

203
0:6:20,34 --> 0:6:23,6
much stronger than the so-called goddesses I pursue

204
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:25,2
and much more attractive

205
0:6:25,2 --> 0:6:26,38
their affection for me is also higher

206
0:6:26,38 --> 0:6:28,96
so often you'll miss out on key opportunities in life

207
0:6:28,96 --> 0:6:32,14
due to your preferences

208
0:6:32,78 --> 0:6:34,58
Many pivotal opportunities in life

209
0:6:34,58 --> 0:6:37,2
can be skewed by your own filters.

210
0:6:37,2 --> 0:6:38,46
Some people might not be beneficial to you,

211
0:6:38,46 --> 0:6:39,56
and they might not be very attractive either.

212
0:6:39,56 --> 0:6:40,78
yet you spend money on them.

213
0:6:40,78 --> 0:6:42,97
You even go to great lengths to spend time on them.

214
0:6:42,97 --> 0:6:46,9
Many people might not be on your radar,

215
0:6:46,9 --> 0:6:47,33
but they quietly follow you.

216
0:6:47,33 --> 0:6:48,9
They are good to you.

217
0:6:48,9 --> 0:6:49,85
But you overlook these people

218
0:6:49,85 --> 0:6:53,2
So sometimes we must break free from our ego

219
0:6:53,2 --> 0:6:55,52
Break free from our own obsessions

220
0:6:55,52 --> 0:6:58,19
Because our obsessions might mislead us

221
0:6:58,19 --> 0:7:2,15
And prevent us from moving towards the most beneficial direction

222
0:7:2,73 --> 0:7:5,93
If you want to maximize your own interests from a pragmatic perspective

223
0:7:5,93 --> 0:7:7,73
To get the best possible outcome

224
0:7:7,73 --> 0:7:10,74
You must have a fair and comprehensive judgment

225
0:7:10,74 --> 0:7:12,9
Who is truly the most useful to you

226
0:7:12,9 --> 0:7:14,74
And who is most useful to you

227
0:7:14,74 --> 0:7:17,57
That's not up to you, understand?

228
0:7:17,57 --> 0:7:20,13
The person you feel is useful to you

229
0:7:20,13 --> 0:7:20,85
is someone you admire

230
0:7:20,85 --> 0:7:21,73
someone you like

231
0:7:21,73 --> 0:7:24,9
but the person who is truly most useful to you right now

232
0:7:24,9 --> 0:7:25,99
you might not even know exists

233
0:7:25,99 --> 0:7:28,7
or you might be aware of their existence

234
0:7:28,7 --> 0:7:30,27
or you might know about these people

235
0:7:30,27 --> 0:7:32,86
in the relationship between the two of you

236
0:7:32,86 --> 0:7:36,2
so you want the random chance to favor you

237
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:37,62
you want the goddess of fortune to smile upon you

238
0:7:37,62 --> 0:7:40,159
you need to be kind to people around you at random

239
0:7:40,159 --> 0:7:41,739
be nice to this person today

240
0:7:41,739 --> 0:7:43,159
be nice to that person tomorrow

241
0:7:43,159 --> 0:7:44,439
have a chat with this person today

242
0:7:44,439 --> 0:7:45,83
have a chat with that person tomorrow

243
0:7:45,83 --> 0:7:47,43
many times there are a lot of resources

244
0:7:47,43 --> 0:7:48,33
some cards at the bottom

245
0:7:48,33 --> 0:7:49,55
when you're flipping them over

246
0:7:49,55 --> 0:7:50,51
you can't see them

247
0:7:50,51 --> 0:7:52,39
it's the same principle as playing cards

248
0:7:52,39 --> 0:7:53,11
so let me tell you

249
0:7:53,11 --> 0:7:54,1
game theory

250
0:7:54,1 --> 0:7:55,9
everyone should learn

251
0:7:55,9 --> 0:7:55,77
often times

252
0:7:55,77 --> 0:7:58,13
your chances of maximizing your opportunities depend on

253
0:7:58,13 --> 0:8:2,77
It's not about whether you have a specific preference or affection for someone

254
0:8:2,77 --> 0:8:5,81
because your judgment can influence various aspects of your life

255
0:8:5,81 --> 0:8:9,65
People generally tend to favor those they envy

256
0:8:9,65 --> 0:8:13,0
but this favoritism means nothing to others

257
0:8:13,0 --> 0:8:14,74
Your genuine kindness

258
0:8:14,74 --> 0:8:16,6
to those who admire you

259
0:8:16,6 --> 0:8:17,24
your kindness

260
0:8:17,24 --> 0:8:19,909
your goodwill has a multiplier effect on them

261
0:8:19,909 --> 0:8:21,389
so you need to understand this

262
0:8:21,389 --> 0:8:23,38
When your goddess is nice to you

263
0:8:23,38 --> 0:8:24,9
you can be nice back

264
0:8:24,9 --> 0:8:27,22
treat the people you admire well

265
0:8:27,22 --> 0:8:29,34
so you should keep those who love you

266
0:8:29,34 --> 0:8:31,88
and those who admire you, close to your heart

267
0:8:31,88 --> 0:8:32,88
this is the most crucial part

268
0:8:32,88 --> 0:8:35,16
this is also why female streamers can raid others' gold coins

269
0:8:35,16 --> 0:8:36,68
while others can't raid the gold coins of female streamers

270
0:8:36,68 --> 0:8:37,46
it all comes down to this

271
0:8:37,46 --> 0:8:40,87
Because they don’t easily get emotionally involved.

272
0:8:40,87 --> 0:8:42,7
Celebrities are the same.

273
0:8:42,7 --> 0:8:43,11
They receive so much love,

274
0:8:43,11 --> 0:8:44,51
so much attention,

275
0:8:44,51 --> 0:8:47,27
that they can’t experience the feeling of being unnoticed.

276
0:8:47,27 --> 0:8:49,11
If he’s not the center of the stage,

277
0:8:49,11 --> 0:8:50,38
he would feel very uncomfortable.

278
0:8:50,38 --> 0:8:52,2
That’s why many actors tend to stick together.

279
0:8:52,2 --> 0:8:53,22
Generally speaking,

280
0:8:53,22 --> 0:8:54,54
There just aren't as many

281
0:8:54,54 --> 0:8:56,74
Of course, when an actor is surrounded by a group of fans

282
0:8:56,74 --> 0:8:58,24
They feel very happy

283
0:8:58,24 --> 0:8:59,99
That's the difference in human nature

284
0:8:59,99 --> 0:9:3,7
So you should really focus on those who love you

285
0:9:3,7 --> 0:9:3,97
Those who like you

286
0:9:3,97 --> 0:9:6,73
The ones who truly care about you

287
0:9:6,73 --> 0:9:8,9
To gain more resources

288
0:9:8,9 --> 0:9:9,85
Instead of those you see as

289
0:9:9,85 --> 0:9:11,57
You think his resources can be utilized.

290
0:9:11,57 --> 0:9:12,81
So people who are better than you,

291
0:9:12,81 --> 0:9:14,16
You can only learn from them.

292
0:9:14,16 --> 0:9:16,88
Only those who are weaker and chasing after you,

293
0:9:16,88 --> 0:9:19,93
You can gain practical benefits and value from them.

294
0:9:19,93 --> 0:9:21,73
That's a big difference.

295
0:9:21,73 --> 0:9:23,85
So people often mix these two things up.

296
0:9:23,85 --> 0:9:25,329
Let me say it again,

297
0:9:25,329 --> 0:9:26,849
Those who truly like you

298
0:9:26,849 --> 0:9:27,609
Admire you

299
0:9:27,609 --> 0:9:28,489
Love you

300
0:9:28,489 --> 0:9:30,289
Are the ones who truly want to help you

301
0:9:30,289 --> 0:9:32,5
Willing to help you improve yourself

302
0:9:32,5 --> 0:9:34,81
But those you think you admire so much

303
0:9:34,81 --> 0:9:35,57
Those you really like

304
0:9:35,57 --> 0:9:36,89
Aren’t that useful to you

305
0:9:36,89 --> 0:9:39,33
You can only learn certain things from them

306
0:9:39,33 --> 0:9:42,4
But you might not be able to apply those things right away

307
0:9:42,4 --> 0:9:44,26
It might not be the right fit for your path

308
0:9:44,26 --> 0:9:45,6
So, in many cases

309
0:9:45,6 --> 0:9:48,12
We should, of course, treat everyone equally

310
0:9:48,12 --> 0:9:50,3
But it's impossible to treat everyone exactly the same

311
0:9:50,3 --> 0:9:52,38
How can anyone treat everyone exactly the same?

312
0:9:52,38 --> 0:9:53,46
You have your own emotions

313
0:9:53,46 --> 0:9:54,76
I have mine as well

314
0:9:54,76 --> 0:9:56,16
You have your preferences

315
0:9:56,16 --> 0:9:57,34
I have mine too

316
0:9:57,34 --> 0:9:57,91
Is that right?

317
0:9:57,91 --> 0:10:0,39
Everyone feels that it hasn't been fair from the start.

318
0:10:0,39 --> 0:10:1,39
It hasn't been just.

319
0:10:1,39 --> 0:10:3,19
We haven't been entirely equal.

320
0:10:3,19 --> 0:10:4,19
We haven't been of the same country.

321
0:10:4,19 --> 0:10:7,4
So often we have to ask how we should really live our lives.

322
0:10:8,44 --> 0:10:10,28
How we should really face the people around us.

323
0:10:10,28 --> 0:10:12,1
Just be kind to others at random.

324
0:10:12,1 --> 0:10:15,7
And don't think those who seem arrogant now are all bad.

325
0:10:15,7 --> 0:10:17,76
He will always hold his head high with pride.

326
0:10:17,76 --> 0:10:20,18
Just because others might not value his time,

327
0:10:20,18 --> 0:10:21,9
They don’t notice you in his world.

328
0:10:21,9 --> 0:10:22,66
So let me tell you,

329
0:10:22,66 --> 0:10:24,22
It’s really hard for UPloaders to make friends,

330
0:10:24,22 --> 0:10:25,1
It’s difficult to interact.

331
0:10:25,1 --> 0:10:27,78
Because everyone is used to being followed,

332
0:10:28,67 --> 0:10:31,99
Like me, I occasionally go and flatter other UPloaders,

333
0:10:31,99 --> 0:10:33,13
Or flatter their followers.

334
0:10:33,13 --> 0:10:34,45
Most people can't tolerate it

335
0:10:34,45 --> 0:10:37,579
But doing so can give you a significant edge

336
0:10:37,579 --> 0:10:40,439
Why could Liu Bei and Cao Cao become heroes

337
0:10:40,439 --> 0:10:42,419
It's because they handled human problems differently

338
0:10:42,419 --> 0:10:44,21
Why could Liu Bang become an emperor

339
0:10:44,21 --> 0:10:46,23
It's because he handled human problems differently

340
0:10:46,23 --> 0:10:47,61
People have feelings

341
0:10:47,61 --> 0:10:50,38
Often, you need to figure out those around you

342
0:10:50,38 --> 0:10:51,78
Your business will naturally thrive

343
0:10:51,78 --> 0:10:53,2
What's the customer's mindset?

344
0:10:53,2 --> 0:10:53,86
The way of cooperation

345
0:10:53,86 --> 0:10:55,96
How to understand others' psychology

346
0:10:55,96 --> 0:10:58,97
In this world, people hustle for their own gains

347
0:10:58,97 --> 0:11:1,55
When others can get something tangible from you

348
0:11:1,55 --> 0:11:2,99
You should give to them

349
0:11:2,99 --> 0:11:6,76
You only gain when you give

350
0:11:6,76 --> 0:11:8,84
Great rewards bring out brave men

351
0:11:8,84 --> 0:11:10,9
When this giving is just an act of kindness

352
0:11:10,9 --> 0:11:13,36
Or it's related to time and a dynamic relationship

353
0:11:13,36 --> 0:11:14,7
You need to turn it around

354
0:11:14,7 --> 0:11:15,76
Do the opposite

355
0:11:15,76 --> 0:11:17,6
That's why we're saying this again

356
0:11:17,6 --> 0:11:21,56
Never think you're protected by a lion

357
0:11:21,56 --> 0:11:23,16
I just like guys who are 1.85 meters tall

358
0:11:23,16 --> 0:11:23,98
I just do this

359
0:11:23,98 --> 0:11:25,66
Those people won't respect you

360
0:11:25,66 --> 0:11:27,54
Those people won't truly help you

361
0:11:27,54 --> 0:11:29,48
You like those good-looking guys

362
0:11:29,48 --> 0:11:30,72
With fair skin and beautiful appearance

363
0:11:30,72 --> 0:11:32,8
You put them in your favorites

364
0:11:32,8 --> 0:11:33,28
Just look at them when you're free

365
0:11:33,28 --> 0:11:34,1
It's fine

366
0:11:34,1 --> 0:11:34,88
This is fine

367
0:11:34,88 --> 0:11:35,56
It's not embarrassing

368
0:11:35,56 --> 0:11:37,4
But the people who can truly help you

369
0:11:37,4 --> 0:11:37,72
Are the ones who like you

370
0:11:37,72 --> 0:11:38,44
The ones who admire you

371
0:11:38,44 --> 0:11:39,64
The people who can truly help you

372
0:11:39,64 --> 0:11:40,95
Are also the ones who appreciate you

373
0:11:40,95 --> 0:11:43,91
These are the people you should keep closer

374
0:11:43,91 --> 0:11:46,25
These are the ones who are truly useful to you

375
0:11:46,25 --> 0:11:48,71
The ones who truly help your growth

376
0:11:48,71 --> 0:11:50,21
The ones who will spend money on you

377
0:11:50,21 --> 0:11:51,25
The ones who care about you

378
0:11:51,25 --> 0:11:53,44
These are the more valuable people

379
0:11:53,44 --> 0:11:54,46
People are often like this

380
0:11:54,46 --> 0:11:56,52
They lick those they can't reach

381
0:11:56,52 --> 0:11:58,96
But neglect those who are truly valuable to them

382
0:11:58,96 --> 0:12:0,52
People are just like that
