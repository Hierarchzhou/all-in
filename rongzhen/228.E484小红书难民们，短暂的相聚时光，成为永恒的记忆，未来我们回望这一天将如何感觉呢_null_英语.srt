0:0:0,58 --> 0:0:1,26
Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,26 --> 0:0:2,62
for the next episode

3
0:0:2,62 --> 0:0:5,78
many people say they miss the way I was in Beijing

4
0:0:5,78 --> 0:0:8,19
with that pure black background

5
0:0:8,19 --> 0:0:9,45
but now, moving on

6
0:0:9,45 --> 0:0:10,79
no matter what

7
0:0:10,79 --> 0:0:11,87
it still has a slight reflection

8
0:0:11,87 --> 0:0:13,3
but I'm still me

9
0:0:13,3 --> 0:0:13,39
you know

10
0:0:13,39 --> 0:0:14,87
Today, let's talk about

11
0:0:14,87 --> 0:0:17,97
the issue of TikTok refugees flooding into Little Red Hill.

12
0:0:17,97 --> 0:0:21,14
Actually, this Little Red Book issue has been widely discussed by many bloggers recently.

13
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:24,6
I feel that it's because I got into the internet relatively early.

14
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:27,22
I remember back when I was using the internet,

15
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:30,9
it was mostly a group of young people who loved computers.

16
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:31,99
I first went online on Silver Sea Web Space.

17
0:0:31,99 --> 0:0:35,27
Back then, I played Diablo I on Battle.net,

18
0:0:35,27 --> 0:0:37,21
and used the earliest version of GameSpy.

19
0:0:37,21 --> 0:0:41,3
Most of the players in this game are foreigners, so you can chat with them in English.

20
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:42,77
Because you can communicate with them in English, after all.

21
0:0:42,77 --> 0:0:45,21
That's when I realized the internet knows no boundaries.

22
0:0:45,21 --> 0:0:48,66
As the internet has gradually developed over time,

23
0:0:48,66 --> 0:0:51,26
and with the existence of social media now,

24
0:0:51,26 --> 0:0:52,18
there are also firewalls in place,

25
0:0:52,18 --> 0:0:53,62
you'll find that often,

26
0:0:53,62 --> 0:0:56,91
people are living in their own information cocoons.

27
0:0:56,91 --> 0:0:59,85
But due to the U.S. actions against TikTok,

28
0:0:59,85 --> 0:1:1,5
This ban

29
0:1:1,5 --> 0:1:3,87
suddenly led to so many people flooding into Xiaohongshu

30
0:1:3,87 --> 0:1:5,39
I find this phenomenon quite interesting

31
0:1:5,39 --> 0:1:8,86
I think whether it's those studying international relations and politics

32
0:1:8,86 --> 0:1:10,4
or those studying sociology

33
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:14,57
they would all verify such a well-known phenomenon

34
0:1:14,57 --> 0:1:16,86
and conduct research and analysis on it

35
0:1:16,86 --> 0:1:19,5
I have a friend who wrote a piece for me

36
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:19,98
It's really good

37
0:1:19,98 --> 0:1:22,62
I think what he's talking about is very fitting.

38
0:1:22,62 --> 0:1:26,8
In the past, you wouldn't notice these kinds of things.

39
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:28,16
Because so much has happened recently.

40
0:1:28,16 --> 0:1:30,85
For example, Hangzhou isn't just Hangzhou.

41
0:1:30,85 --> 0:1:33,85
This new sixth-generation aircraft flying between Shenyang and Chengdu.

42
0:1:33,85 --> 0:1:35,69
It just happened all of a sudden.

43
0:1:35,69 --> 0:1:37,5
The mountain doesn't see me.

44
0:1:37,5 --> 0:1:38,31
I see myself.

45
0:1:38,31 --> 0:1:40,15
We have become the mountain.

46
0:1:40,15 --> 0:1:43,89
We've become the so-called 'other people's child'.

47
0:1:43,89 --> 0:1:46,25
We've always been envious of others' technological advancements.

48
0:1:46,25 --> 0:1:48,21
We've admired others' various achievements.

49
0:1:48,21 --> 0:1:50,97
Suddenly, the tables seem to have turned.

50
0:1:50,97 --> 0:1:54,33
And often, it's a complete and utter...

51
0:1:54,33 --> 0:1:57,25
Staying still, not moving...

52
0:1:57,25 --> 0:1:59,91
It gives a sense of responding to all changes with no change.

53
0:1:59,91 --> 0:2:2,18
In fact, we haven't done anything at all.

54
0:2:2,18 --> 0:2:4,4
Actually, the U.S. has done a lot in this regard.

55
0:2:4,4 --> 0:2:6,46
He aims to reduce China's influence in this regard.

56
0:2:6,46 --> 0:2:7,78
Regarding his cultural impact,

57
0:2:7,78 --> 0:2:9,46
this is understandable for a country.

58
0:2:9,46 --> 0:2:10,519
It can be understood.

59
0:2:10,519 --> 0:2:12,259
However, promoting such exchanges,

60
0:2:12,259 --> 0:2:15,479
you will gradually realize that the lies spread in the media,

61
0:2:15,479 --> 0:2:17,36
will fall apart on their own.

62
0:2:17,36 --> 0:2:19,44
Just like last year's China travel campaign,

63
0:2:19,44 --> 0:2:21,14
many things are like this.

64
0:2:21,14 --> 0:2:24,58
Once everyone starts to spontaneously appear with visa-free travel

65
0:2:24,58 --> 0:2:26,14
More and more things will start to emerge

66
0:2:28,44 --> 0:2:31,0
Many things actually stem from the exchange

67
0:2:31,0 --> 0:2:33,38
People will discover the real stuff

68
0:2:33,38 --> 0:2:35,48
When it comes to the locals

69
0:2:35,48 --> 0:2:36,98
They don't even want to use Facebook

70
0:2:36,98 --> 0:2:38,94
They're not keen on Instagram either

71
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:39,88
All sorts of apps

72
0:2:39,88 --> 0:2:40,68
Not just ByteDance's

73
0:2:40,68 --> 0:2:41,64
It's about Xiaohongshu

74
0:2:41,64 --> 0:2:42,74
Anyway, it doesn't matter

75
0:2:42,74 --> 0:2:44,96
No matter how you put it, it's still a

76
0:2:44,96 --> 0:2:47,58
But after he gradually got used to using this kind of thing

77
0:2:47,58 --> 0:2:48,8
He slowly became dependent on it

78
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:50,42
Of course, I think it's a bit of a pity

79
0:2:50,42 --> 0:2:52,9
Bilibili didn't manage to capitalize on this wave of traffic

80
0:2:52,9 --> 0:2:53,9
But I think it's Bilibili

81
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:56,28
Because it's positioned to compete with YouTube abroad

82
0:2:56,28 --> 0:2:57,24
When it comes to YouTube,

83
0:2:57,24 --> 0:2:58,48
the ecosystem is quite similar to Bilibili,

84
0:2:58,48 --> 0:3:1,43
Bilibili now feels like a mix of YouTube and OnlyFans,

85
0:3:1,43 --> 0:3:3,19
with some paid content as well,

86
0:3:3,19 --> 0:3:4,87
but to be honest,

87
0:3:4,87 --> 0:3:7,56
Yang Dou can post photos,

88
0:3:7,56 --> 0:3:9,26
and the Little Red Book where you can share diaries,

89
0:3:9,26 --> 0:3:11,38
are actually more similar in many ways,

90
0:3:11,38 --> 0:3:14,94
Americans have now gotten used to these kinds of platforms.

91
0:3:14,94 --> 0:3:15,94
These products under our brand

92
0:3:15,94 --> 0:3:18,54
So asking users to suddenly change their habits

93
0:3:18,54 --> 0:3:19,88
You think that's really tough

94
0:3:19,88 --> 0:3:22,16
Cultivating users' shopping habits

95
0:3:22,16 --> 0:3:24,44
It takes a long time to develop usage habits

96
0:3:24,44 --> 0:3:25,82
You need to have an excellent product

97
0:3:25,82 --> 0:3:29,1
Just like the electric vehicles we see today

98
0:3:29,1 --> 0:3:32,97
These people are only now starting to catch up in terms of technological accumulation

99
0:3:32,97 --> 0:3:33,81
But they can't catch up anymore

100
0:3:33,81 --> 0:3:35,33
In addition to the issue of raw material production

101
0:3:35,33 --> 0:3:37,73
China will definitely take the lead in the future

102
0:3:37,73 --> 0:3:39,42
and lead by a wide margin

103
0:3:39,42 --> 0:3:41,26
Others lack these strategic conditions

104
0:3:41,26 --> 0:3:42,74
leaving them in a forced world

105
0:3:42,74 --> 0:3:42,94
moving

106
0:3:42,94 --> 0:3:44,74
from what is called a multipolar state

107
0:3:44,74 --> 0:3:48,76
back to a bipolar relative state

108
0:3:48,76 --> 0:3:51,22
Let's also discuss the long-term issues between the Chinese and American people

109
0:3:51,22 --> 0:3:52,65
Burst a lot of bubbles

110
0:3:52,65 --> 0:3:53,99
Many people will find out

111
0:3:53,99 --> 0:3:56,13
Who really isn't doing well?

112
0:3:56,13 --> 0:3:58,45
It might be worse over there.

113
0:3:58,45 --> 0:4:1,4
If we calculate using the average purchasing power,

114
0:4:1,4 --> 0:4:3,64
What’s the term for purchasing power again?

115
0:4:3,64 --> 0:4:4,8
Is it GGP or something?

116
0:4:4,8 --> 0:4:6,32
It doesn’t seem to have much to do with GDP.

117
0:4:6,32 --> 0:4:9,81
Because we often suffer from these conversion losses.

118
0:4:9,81 --> 0:4:11,97
Because their currency is more valuable than ours

119
0:4:11,97 --> 0:4:12,95
Our currency has depreciated

120
0:4:12,95 --> 0:4:14,63
So, regardless of how we look at it

121
0:4:14,63 --> 0:4:16,59
But just from the perspective of purchasing power

122
0:4:16,59 --> 0:4:17,79
And living conditions

123
0:4:17,79 --> 0:4:18,39
You will find

124
0:4:18,39 --> 0:4:19,83
When comparing the accounts of Chinese and American people

125
0:4:19,83 --> 0:4:22,98
Many people really struggle with the cost of living

126
0:4:22,98 --> 0:4:26,1
It’s not like we imagine, earning 340,000 yuan a month

127
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:27,22
He is converted over.

128
0:4:27,22 --> 0:4:28,42
But in reality,

129
0:4:28,42 --> 0:4:29,5
it's a life of three or four thousand dollars.

130
0:4:29,5 --> 0:4:31,63
That's the life of three or four thousand people in the country.

131
0:4:31,63 --> 0:4:34,23
There are many things you can't just calculate like that.

132
0:4:34,23 --> 0:4:37,19
So once these things start to be exchanged,

133
0:4:37,19 --> 0:4:40,13
it becomes really interesting.

134
0:4:40,13 --> 0:4:42,83
Once a person enters the other's information echo chamber,

135
0:4:42,83 --> 0:4:44,51
the walls between the two groups come tumbling down.

136
0:4:44,51 --> 0:4:46,28
Suddenly, the accounts started to match up.

137
0:4:46,28 --> 0:4:48,32
This would create a rather interesting phenomenon.

138
0:4:48,32 --> 0:4:50,55
In the past, when it comes to countries around the world,

139
0:4:50,55 --> 0:4:52,27
especially during World War I and World War II,

140
0:4:52,27 --> 0:4:54,43
they mainly relied on newspapers and mass media.

141
0:4:54,43 --> 0:4:55,71
So this is what we call mass control.

142
0:4:55,71 --> 0:4:57,43
Ah, this MASCO,

143
0:4:57,43 --> 0:4:59,51
the media in Japanese is 'musk',

144
0:4:59,51 --> 0:5:0,63
this 'musk' thing.

145
0:5:0,63 --> 0:5:4,429
It is essentially a means of mass control.

146
0:5:4,429 --> 0:5:6,649
Propaganda has been around since World War II in the Soviet Union,

147
0:5:6,649 --> 0:5:8,489
and during the time of the German Empire in World War II,

148
0:5:8,489 --> 0:5:10,32
when it began to take shape.

149
0:5:10,32 --> 0:5:13,45
It was only after the Cold War that the United States continued to use this approach.

150
0:5:13,45 --> 0:5:16,65
There will always be issues of ideology between countries.

151
0:5:16,65 --> 0:5:17,81
But in reality,

152
0:5:17,81 --> 0:5:19,57
people are divided by language,

153
0:5:19,57 --> 0:5:20,889
and by the media.

154
0:5:20,889 --> 0:5:22,409
Because the means of communication are different

155
0:5:22,409 --> 0:5:22,889
when we talk about it

156
0:5:22,889 --> 0:5:25,709
there hasn't been a bridge for communication

157
0:5:25,709 --> 0:5:28,45
now software can translate directly

158
0:5:28,45 --> 0:5:29,69
there are many things

159
0:5:29,69 --> 0:5:31,49
as long as there's no technical barrier

160
0:5:31,49 --> 0:5:33,409
we can actually get things done pretty quickly

161
0:5:33,409 --> 0:5:35,89
so when we talk about these things

162
0:5:35,89 --> 0:5:37,249
this time it's about China's technological advancements

163
0:5:37,249 --> 0:5:38,649
Winning in the algorithm again

164
0:5:38,649 --> 0:5:41,76
So many things actually have their pros and cons

165
0:5:41,76 --> 0:5:44,54
The other party will take the initiative to come and get some information

166
0:5:44,54 --> 0:5:46,59
This thing gradually levels out like water

167
0:5:46,59 --> 0:5:47,93
It will gradually balance out

168
0:5:49,89 --> 0:5:50,89
It’s indeed interesting

169
0:5:50,89 --> 0:5:53,61
Sometimes when you keep talking on one side

170
0:5:53,61 --> 0:5:54,93
About how good things are abroad

171
0:5:54,93 --> 0:5:58,87
We usually refer to the wealthy

172
0:5:58,87 --> 0:6:0,61
What's life like for the wealthy?

173
0:6:0,61 --> 0:6:2,91
Later, they also showed us more of these things.

174
0:6:2,91 --> 0:6:6,2
But what about the everyday life of ordinary people?

175
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:7,32
Maybe they have a cat,

176
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:7,76
or a dog,

177
0:6:7,76 --> 0:6:9,6
sitting on the couch, unwilling to move.

178
0:6:9,6 --> 0:6:11,65
And a lot of the time, they just scroll through Douyin.

179
0:6:11,65 --> 0:6:13,1
Actually, we're all the same.

180
0:6:13,1 --> 0:6:14,29
From this perspective,

181
0:6:14,29 --> 0:6:15,21
you'll often find that

182
0:6:15,21 --> 0:6:17,15
This global village is truly very small.

183
0:6:17,15 --> 0:6:21,31
In the future, we might rebuild our information cocoons,

184
0:6:21,31 --> 0:6:22,73
the walls might go up again,

185
0:6:22,73 --> 0:6:26,4
and Douyin will try to delay this as much as possible.

186
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:29,8
So they might end up as refugees on Xiaohongshu in the future.

187
0:6:29,8 --> 0:6:30,12
There might not be as many on Xiaohongshu,

188
0:6:30,12 --> 0:6:31,89
but they might gradually patch up the technical loopholes.

189
0:6:31,89 --> 0:6:33,61
So no matter what,

190
0:6:33,61 --> 0:6:34,61
please remember, no matter what happens in the future,

191
0:6:34,61 --> 0:6:37,69
to cherish this beautiful, fleeting process.

192
0:6:37,69 --> 0:6:40,1
After all, you and I are just different by nationality,

193
0:6:40,1 --> 0:6:42,28
but fundamentally, people are the same.

194
0:6:42,28 --> 0:6:43,74
We all have a heart full of passion.
