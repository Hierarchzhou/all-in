0:0:0,86 --> 0:0:2,2
Hey everyone,

2
0:0:2,2 --> 0:0:3,26
welcome to another episode of Bed Chat.

3
0:0:3,26 --> 0:0:4,78
This should be episode 498.

4
0:0:4,78 --> 0:0:6,7
Today, we're going to talk about something really interesting,

5
0:0:6,7 --> 0:0:8,23
which is social currency.

6
0:0:8,23 --> 0:0:10,25
What exactly is social currency?

7
0:0:10,25 --> 0:0:12,55
To put it simply, it's about the connections you make.

8
0:0:12,55 --> 0:0:14,29
But rather than just connections,

9
0:0:14,29 --> 0:0:17,52
it's more about the useful people you network with.

10
0:0:17,52 --> 0:0:19,26
There's a rather pragmatic saying

11
0:0:19,26 --> 0:0:20,1
about making friends

12
0:0:20,1 --> 0:0:21,11
that you should only befriend those who are useful

13
0:0:21,11 --> 0:0:22,91
but if you approach friendships with this mindset

14
0:0:22,91 --> 0:0:23,67
generally speaking

15
0:0:23,67 --> 0:0:25,71
you might end up with superficial connections

16
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:27,61
yet we emphasize the importance of socializing

17
0:0:27,61 --> 0:0:30,85
especially in business where networking is crucial

18
0:0:30,85 --> 0:0:33,45
and for ordinary folks like us

19
0:0:33,45 --> 0:0:34,73
Even if you don’t do business

20
0:0:34,73 --> 0:0:35,97
or step into the commercial world

21
0:0:35,97 --> 0:0:38,5
social currency is still very important to me

22
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:40,16
I recently read a book called The Social Economy

23
0:0:40,16 --> 0:0:43,16
The author of The Social Economy is from the former Soviet Union

24
0:0:43,16 --> 0:0:44,44
and later immigrated to the United States

25
0:0:44,44 --> 0:0:47,11
He mentioned that when his mother was alive

26
0:0:47,11 --> 0:0:49,77
it was often the case that the Soviet Union had a system of rationing

27
0:0:49,77 --> 0:0:51,31
but this was during the 1970s and 1980s

28
0:0:51,31 --> 0:0:52,19
Life at home is quite comfortable

29
0:0:52,19 --> 0:0:53,79
Because his mother is a doctor

30
0:0:53,79 --> 0:0:55,5
She often provides free medical consultations

31
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:57,77
So these things form part of social currency

32
0:0:57,77 --> 0:0:59,17
Let's start with social currency

33
0:0:59,17 --> 0:1:1,33
First, you need to have something to trade as social currency

34
0:1:1,33 --> 0:1:2,41
For example, you might be a hard asset

35
0:1:2,41 --> 0:1:4,129
You know how to build computers

36
0:1:4,129 --> 0:1:6,769
You can help people with medical issues

37
0:1:6,769 --> 0:1:7,869
You'd be the one to fight legal battles for others.

38
0:1:7,869 --> 0:1:10,929
You're like the lawyer I'm actually using right now.

39
0:1:10,929 --> 0:1:12,47
Including the doctor I'm seeing currently.

40
0:1:12,47 --> 0:1:15,57
Most of them I found through social networks.

41
0:1:15,57 --> 0:1:18,86
People I met on social media, who are my followers.

42
0:1:18,86 --> 0:1:21,56
Thinking back to the life my parents provided for me,

43
0:1:21,56 --> 0:1:23,34
A lot of the time, it was my dad,

44
0:1:23,34 --> 0:1:25,7
Or my mom, who saved up these resources,

45
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,33
These social connections, if you will.

46
0:1:28,33 --> 0:1:29,87
Give me one to use

47
0:1:29,87 --> 0:1:32,59
Back in the old days, many things weren’t as readily available

48
0:1:32,59 --> 0:1:35,1
Material exchange wasn’t as developed

49
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:36,39
Often, even if you had money

50
0:1:36,39 --> 0:1:39,19
You couldn’t get the resources the other party wanted

51
0:1:39,19 --> 0:1:42,18
More often, it was about mutual benefit

52
0:1:42,18 --> 0:1:44,3
Like my dad, back in the day, he worked at a gallery

53
0:1:44,3 --> 0:1:46,3
He helped many artists sell their paintings

54
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:48,26
Because artists, as a type of creator

55
0:1:48,26 --> 0:1:49,63
So very aloof.

56
0:1:49,63 --> 0:1:50,51
So very aloof.

57
0:1:50,51 --> 0:1:51,63
For these people,

58
0:1:51,63 --> 0:1:53,81
they also rely on the income from selling paintings to live.

59
0:1:53,81 --> 0:1:56,71
So he formed a life-and-death alliance with them.

60
0:1:56,71 --> 0:1:59,11
My mom, as an accountant at an accounting firm,

61
0:1:59,11 --> 0:2:1,97
often helps various companies handle their financial records.

62
0:2:1,97 --> 0:2:3,83
When it comes to financial records,

63
0:2:3,83 --> 0:2:5,389
it’s also a matter of life and death.

64
0:2:5,389 --> 0:2:7,509
So gradually, a kind of relationship developed, one that is both close and distant with entrepreneurs

65
0:2:7,509 --> 0:2:9,429
and artists,

66
0:2:9,429 --> 0:2:11,249
a very harmonious relationship.

67
0:2:11,249 --> 0:2:13,189
In this dynamic,

68
0:2:13,189 --> 0:2:15,3
reflecting on my past,

69
0:2:15,3 --> 0:2:18,64
whether it was applying to school,

70
0:2:18,64 --> 0:2:20,6
things at home,

71
0:2:20,6 --> 0:2:20,68
mobile phones,

72
0:2:20,68 --> 0:2:21,28
cameras

73
0:2:21,28 --> 0:2:22,82
Basically, they are all new.

74
0:2:22,82 --> 0:2:24,9
Someone will regularly deliver these items.

75
0:2:24,9 --> 0:2:27,86
These items are essentially what we call social currency.

76
0:2:27,86 --> 0:2:29,7
They represent the convenience you can offer to others.

77
0:2:29,7 --> 0:2:31,18
Or the leverage you have over others.

78
0:2:31,18 --> 0:2:34,9
You accumulate these things in your daily life.

79
0:2:34,9 --> 0:2:35,409
For the future development of your children,

80
0:2:35,409 --> 0:2:37,709
For your own lifestyle,

81
0:2:37,709 --> 0:2:39,589
They all contribute to a richer and more fulfilling experience.

82
0:2:39,589 --> 0:2:42,469
Many things aren't necessarily bought with money.

83
0:2:42,469 --> 0:2:44,29
That's why we often say making friends.

84
0:2:44,29 --> 0:2:46,98
Actually, when you have a lot of private connections in your social network,

85
0:2:46,98 --> 0:2:48,46
you can manage and categorize them.

86
0:2:48,46 --> 0:2:50,54
For example, I now have over 20,000 WeChat friends.

87
0:2:50,54 --> 0:2:51,74
Speaking of these WeChat friends,

88
0:2:51,74 --> 0:2:53,12
they are spread all over the world.

89
0:2:53,12 --> 0:2:54,53
And in terms of these connections,

90
0:2:54,53 --> 0:2:57,35
they come from various industries and circles.

91
0:2:57,35 --> 0:2:58,97
Let's talk about the simplest issue.

92
0:2:58,97 --> 0:3:1,76
You always want to meet young girls and add them on WeChat, right?

93
0:3:1,76 --> 0:3:4,24
Isn't that also something you get from your social network?

94
0:3:4,24 --> 0:3:6,18
So, when it comes to social networks nowadays,

95
0:3:6,18 --> 0:3:7,92
how to expand your connections,

96
0:3:7,92 --> 0:3:9,35
increase your circle of friends,

97
0:3:9,35 --> 0:3:10,57
not just classmates,

98
0:3:10,57 --> 0:3:11,51
not just colleagues,

99
0:3:11,51 --> 0:3:14,11
not just people you meet at clubs.

100
0:3:14,11 --> 0:3:15,87
How do you usually get to know others?

101
0:3:15,87 --> 0:3:17,41
To achieve a deep and effective social connection,

102
0:3:17,41 --> 0:3:20,13
I think it's actually a good idea to create your own online presence,

103
0:3:20,13 --> 0:3:21,41
build your own social media platform,

104
0:3:21,41 --> 0:3:22,45
which can be very useful,

105
0:3:22,45 --> 0:3:25,399
a very suitable way to earn social capital.

106
0:3:25,399 --> 0:3:27,839
That is, once you truly gain social capital,

107
0:3:27,839 --> 0:3:28,759
many opportunities will arise,

108
0:3:28,759 --> 0:3:32,3
we often talk about business insights and more, and when exactly they come into play.

109
0:3:32,3 --> 0:3:33,11
These trends may come

110
0:3:33,11 --> 0:3:35,51
You never know when these things will actually be useful to you

111
0:3:35,51 --> 0:3:36,66
But your friend might catch them first

112
0:3:36,66 --> 0:3:38,74
So you, how should I put it

113
0:3:38,74 --> 0:3:41,3
You're like an intelligence officer

114
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:42,74
Who needs to build a vast intelligence network

115
0:3:42,74 --> 0:3:46,43
To ensure you get this information

116
0:3:46,43 --> 0:3:48,25
To get it as soon as possible

117
0:3:48,25 --> 0:3:50,52
Being able to get these things right away

118
0:3:50,52 --> 0:3:52,6
So it's like fishing.

119
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:53,16
Fishing and angling.

120
0:3:53,16 --> 0:3:55,8
In daily life, you usually interact with just one or two people.

121
0:3:55,8 --> 0:3:56,15
That's angling.

122
0:3:56,15 --> 0:3:58,51
If you have a robust social network,

123
0:3:58,51 --> 0:4:0,33
and you frequently maintain this network,

124
0:4:0,33 --> 0:4:1,39
then that's fishing.

125
0:4:1,39 --> 0:4:2,87
Back then, they used gill nets for fishing.

126
0:4:2,87 --> 0:4:3,67
Mechanized fishing,

127
0:4:3,67 --> 0:4:4,94
that's incredibly fast.

128
0:4:4,94 --> 0:4:7,74
So, in today's world,

129
0:4:7,74 --> 0:4:9,8
regardless of the tools we use or how we do it,

130
0:4:9,8 --> 0:4:12,54
we need to strengthen our network expansion.

131
0:4:12,54 --> 0:4:16,62
Expand the vertical and horizontal links of our social network,

132
0:4:16,62 --> 0:4:19,74
whether it's with people of the same age or in the same industry,

133
0:4:19,74 --> 0:4:21,78
intergenerational connections are crucial.

134
0:4:21,78 --> 0:4:24,76
So, acquiring social capital is vital for our life journey,

135
0:4:24,76 --> 0:4:25,8
extremely important.
