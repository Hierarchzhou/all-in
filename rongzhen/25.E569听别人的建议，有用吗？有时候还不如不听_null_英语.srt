0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:0,88
Hi everyone

2
0:0:0,88 --> 0:0:2,51
welcome to another episode of Bed Sheet Chat

3
0:0:2,51 --> 0:0:5,55
when life’s path isn’t smooth

4
0:0:5,55 --> 0:0:7,29
should we listen to others

5
0:0:7,29 --> 0:0:9,43
or should we firmly believe in ourselves

6
0:0:9,43 --> 0:0:12,38
at this point, many people have different answers

7
0:0:12,38 --> 0:0:14,5
some say we should listen to others’ advice

8
0:0:14,5 --> 0:0:17,1
because listening to others can make you humble

9
0:0:17,1 --> 0:0:19,4
and help you embrace good things

10
0:0:19,4 --> 0:0:21,68
while others say we should trust in ourselves

11
0:0:21,68 --> 0:0:22,96
Because only you know your own affairs

12
0:0:22,96 --> 0:0:23,86
You have the intuition

13
0:0:23,86 --> 0:0:24,82
You can know for sure

14
0:0:24,82 --> 0:0:26,67
Well, how should I put it

15
0:0:26,67 --> 0:0:28,41
We should analyze specific issues on a case-by-case basis

16
0:0:28,41 --> 0:0:29,39
A couple of days ago

17
0:0:29,39 --> 0:0:32,92
I attended the gathering of the Power Up department at Bilibili

18
0:0:32,92 --> 0:0:35,28
We had a great time touring Wuzhen

19
0:0:35,28 --> 0:0:37,61
I felt really good in Wuzhen

20
0:0:37,61 --> 0:0:40,33
After all, I'm someone who enjoys lively environments

21
0:0:40,33 --> 0:0:41,25
Actually, Brother Rong is the kind of person who

22
0:0:41,25 --> 0:0:44,4
loves to participate in all sorts of exhibitions and events.

23
0:0:44,4 --> 0:0:45,78
If you have any events,

24
0:0:45,78 --> 0:0:47,56
I'd be more than happy to be a guest.

25
0:0:47,56 --> 0:0:49,879
I'd go even if you didn't pay me,

26
0:0:49,879 --> 0:0:52,559
just cover my travel expenses, that's all.

27
0:0:52,559 --> 0:0:54,9
I don't eat much anyway.

28
0:0:54,9 --> 0:0:56,75
I really enjoy being a guest for people.

29
0:0:56,75 --> 0:1:0,2
But speaking of the content at the Power Up conference this time,

30
0:1:0,2 --> 0:1:1,52
I can't really disclose it.

31
0:1:1,52 --> 0:1:3,92
But it did give me a lot of

32
0:1:3,92 --> 0:1:6,66
Really fresh perspectives and feelings

33
0:1:6,66 --> 0:1:9,58
But this year, there was a bit of a backlash

34
0:1:9,58 --> 0:1:11,6
There was also a downside

35
0:1:11,6 --> 0:1:11,7
And that is

36
0:1:11,7 --> 0:1:13,99
Your anxiety starts to build up

37
0:1:13,99 --> 0:1:16,1
Oh, so many people are doing such a great job

38
0:1:16,1 --> 0:1:19,44
Actually, they are motivating us to do better

39
0:1:19,44 --> 0:1:20,94
But I noticed

40
0:1:20,94 --> 0:1:23,729
The operations team gave us a lot of valuable suggestions

41
0:1:23,729 --> 0:1:25,909
These suggestions have been compiled into a booklet.

42
0:1:25,909 --> 0:1:27,969
Sometimes I flip through it to take a look.

43
0:1:27,969 --> 0:1:29,929
All the Power Up areas,

44
0:1:29,929 --> 0:1:32,92
along with various fan-growth strategies in the general sections,

45
0:1:32,92 --> 0:1:34,36
and operational tactics like these,

46
0:1:34,36 --> 0:1:36,36
are now gathered into PDFs.

47
0:1:36,36 --> 0:1:37,87
We can go through them ourselves.

48
0:1:37,87 --> 0:1:40,11
Based on these PDFs,

49
0:1:40,11 --> 0:1:42,11
I made adjustments to the show myself.

50
0:1:42,11 --> 0:1:43,67
After making these adjustments,

51
0:1:43,67 --> 0:1:46,9
The effect is evident.

52
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:49,33
The revenue dropped by 50%.

53
0:1:49,33 --> 0:1:51,28
More than 50%.

54
0:1:51,28 --> 0:1:53,6
It had an immediate impact.

55
0:1:53,6 --> 0:1:55,2
Because I mainly changed the cover design.

56
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:58,759
After changing the cover, everyone started using some AI-generated images.

57
0:1:58,759 --> 0:2:0,639
And used larger fonts.

58
0:2:0,639 --> 0:2:3,27
This is the result of other UPloaders' successful practices.

59
0:2:3,27 --> 0:2:5,79
I also changed the preview duration.

60
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:6,55
From one minute.

61
0:2:6,55 --> 0:2:7,75
Some changed to 10 minutes

62
0:2:7,75 --> 0:2:8,87
Some changed to 3 minutes

63
0:2:8,87 --> 0:2:11,68
Then I also changed the strategy

64
0:2:11,68 --> 0:2:14,32
I stopped doing the series that were previously successful

65
0:2:14,32 --> 0:2:16,46
I no longer categorized my series

66
0:2:16,46 --> 0:2:19,18
I stopped dividing them into different categories

67
0:2:19,18 --> 0:2:20,4
I just broke them down

68
0:2:20,4 --> 0:2:23,48
These were halfway through when I just gave them titles

69
0:2:23,48 --> 0:2:26,2
In this regard, I'm like most UPloaders

70
0:2:26,2 --> 0:2:27,2
Right?

71
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:29,18
Compared to those big UPs,

72
0:2:29,18 --> 0:2:30,46
they have more people powering them up,

73
0:2:30,46 --> 0:2:31,7
they have a larger audience overall,

74
0:2:31,7 --> 0:2:33,42
and they produce higher quality content as well.

75
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:34,44
So, I learn from them.

76
0:2:34,44 --> 0:2:35,73
But let me tell you,

77
0:2:35,73 --> 0:2:38,19
blindly copying them won’t do any good.

78
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:39,11
Blind imitation,

79
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:40,21
changing your tags,

80
0:2:40,21 --> 0:2:42,44
will make people not recognize your videos anymore.

81
0:2:42,44 --> 0:2:44,12
Often, people will click in

82
0:2:44,12 --> 0:2:45,6
to watch my videos

83
0:2:45,6 --> 0:2:46,4
not for the text

84
0:2:46,4 --> 0:2:48,3
but to see my big face

85
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:50,54
and the red and green text on my face

86
0:2:50,54 --> 0:2:51,54
and then they click in

87
0:2:51,54 --> 0:2:52,7
just because it's on the Home page

88
0:2:52,7 --> 0:2:53,769
and they click in

89
0:2:53,769 --> 0:2:54,929
I change the cover

90
0:2:54,929 --> 0:2:56,969
and people feel it's not the same bold content anymore

91
0:2:56,969 --> 0:2:59,69
And changing the preview duration didn’t help either.

92
0:2:59,69 --> 0:3:1,25
After changing the preview duration,

93
0:3:1,25 --> 0:3:3,39
sometimes it fails to spark people’s interest.

94
0:3:3,39 --> 0:3:4,93
Once they see it too much, they think,

95
0:3:4,93 --> 0:3:6,29
Oh, it’s just the same old thing.

96
0:3:6,29 --> 0:3:8,13
They won’t bother to click in anymore.

97
0:3:8,13 --> 0:3:11,1
But I do have good content to share.

98
0:3:11,1 --> 0:3:12,57
I have a loyal following,

99
0:3:12,57 --> 0:3:13,99
who regularly check in to watch.

100
0:3:13,99 --> 0:3:16,79
In a way, I’ve let down my long-time followers.

101
0:3:16,79 --> 0:3:18,37
Always wanting to get

102
0:3:18,37 --> 0:3:19,39
to gain some new followers

103
0:3:19,39 --> 0:3:20,77
is actually not very likely

104
0:3:20,77 --> 0:3:22,51
for someone to actually become your follower

105
0:3:22,51 --> 0:3:24,53
it takes a long time

106
0:3:24,53 --> 0:3:26,1
not just watching one or two episodes

107
0:3:26,1 --> 0:3:26,97
sometimes watching ten episodes

108
0:3:26,97 --> 0:3:27,74
twenty episodes

109
0:3:27,74 --> 0:3:29,62
and suddenly one day, an inspiration hits

110
0:3:29,62 --> 0:3:30,26
and it passes

111
0:3:30,26 --> 0:3:31,26
Director Rong's stuff is really great

112
0:3:31,26 --> 0:3:32,38
I'm willing to pay for Director Rong

113
0:3:32,38 --> 0:3:34,88
It's been a long journey for him

114
0:3:34,88 --> 0:3:37,4
So often it ends up being like pulling up seedlings to help them grow

115
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:39,98
Because I want to catch up with others

116
0:3:39,98 --> 0:3:41,38
I want what others have

117
0:3:41,38 --> 0:3:42,54
I have 30,000 Power Up

118
0:3:42,54 --> 0:3:43,62
Others have 60,000 Power Up

119
0:3:43,62 --> 0:3:45,14
Oh, others have 200,000 Power Up

120
0:3:45,14 --> 0:3:45,68
Right?

121
0:3:45,68 --> 0:3:46,84
I have 600,000 followers.

122
0:3:46,84 --> 0:3:47,68
Someone else has a million.

123
0:3:47,68 --> 0:3:48,74
They have 3 million followers.

124
0:3:48,74 --> 0:3:53,1
First, you need to understand that the gap between people is quite common.

125
0:3:53,1 --> 0:3:55,2
You can also look for subjective differences.

126
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:56,2
And objective differences as well.

127
0:3:56,2 --> 0:3:57,32
Objective differences are straightforward.

128
0:3:57,32 --> 0:3:59,6
It means they have a team.

129
0:3:59,6 --> 0:4:1,12
Many people are just the faces in front of the camera.

130
0:4:1,12 --> 0:4:1,74
They are the boss.

131
0:4:1,74 --> 0:4:2,92
Many people have teams.

132
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:3,64
Some have over a dozen members.

133
0:4:3,64 --> 0:4:4,36
Some have over a hundred.

134
0:4:4,36 --> 0:4:5,32
Some have more than 200 members.

135
0:4:5,32 --> 0:4:7,11
Teams with over 300 members are not uncommon.

136
0:4:7,11 --> 0:4:8,95
So, they're not just running one account.

137
0:4:8,95 --> 0:4:12,2
The boss is just the face of the operation.

138
0:4:12,2 --> 0:4:13,26
That's why they all have teams.

139
0:4:13,26 --> 0:4:16,3
But I'm flying solo on this short video thing.

140
0:4:16,3 --> 0:4:17,19
Right?

141
0:4:17,19 --> 0:4:18,519
And quite often, you know,

142
0:4:18,519 --> 0:4:19,599
you have so many followers,

143
0:4:19,599 --> 0:4:21,739
you really should have that many followers,

144
0:4:21,739 --> 0:4:25,24
the limit of your Bilibili audience is those who like your content,

145
0:4:25,24 --> 0:4:26,4
it's roughly that many people.

146
0:4:26,4 --> 0:4:28,12
You keep thinking about gaining more followers, more followers, more followers,

147
0:4:28,12 --> 0:4:30,88
constantly trying to take shortcuts,

148
0:4:30,88 --> 0:4:32,22
to stand out,

149
0:4:32,22 --> 0:4:33,54
but in fact, it’s more likely to lose followers,

150
0:4:33,54 --> 0:4:36,69
and you might end up alienating your core audience.

151
0:4:36,69 --> 0:4:38,54
Because your core audience expects you to consistently produce content.

152
0:4:38,54 --> 0:4:41,98
And everything we talk about is trending.

153
0:4:41,98 --> 0:4:42,82
It all has its moment in the spotlight.

154
0:4:42,82 --> 0:4:45,3
After you've had your peak, it's natural that you won't be as popular.

155
0:4:45,3 --> 0:4:47,19
That's a very normal thing.

156
0:4:47,19 --> 0:4:49,63
But people just can't accept this fact.

157
0:4:49,63 --> 0:4:51,51
In many cases, it's exactly like this.

158
0:4:51,51 --> 0:4:52,83
Sometimes when I talk about others,

159
0:4:52,83 --> 0:4:55,31
I myself also face similar issues.

160
0:4:55,31 --> 0:4:57,63
It's about your physical functions.

161
0:4:57,63 --> 0:4:59,21
Your appearance

162
0:4:59,21 --> 0:5:0,53
all these energies of yours

163
0:5:0,53 --> 0:5:3,25
will eventually decline over time

164
0:5:3,25 --> 0:5:4,57
not just your account

165
0:5:4,57 --> 0:5:5,81
your health

166
0:5:5,81 --> 0:5:8,0
all your abilities

167
0:5:8,0 --> 0:5:9,0
your reputation

168
0:5:9,0 --> 0:5:11,64
your wealth will gradually diminish

169
0:5:11,64 --> 0:5:12,74
think about some things

170
0:5:12,74 --> 0:5:14,76
if I were a 95-year-old now

171
0:5:14,76 --> 0:5:16,6
In a nursing home,

172
0:5:16,6 --> 0:5:17,74
right?

173
0:5:17,74 --> 0:5:20,28
Many families might no longer be around,

174
0:5:20,28 --> 0:5:22,68
It’s uncertain whether anyone will come to visit me.

175
0:5:22,68 --> 0:5:23,32
Isn’t that so?

176
0:5:23,32 --> 0:5:24,36
Your own wealth,

177
0:5:24,36 --> 0:5:27,58
You might even forget your bank PIN.

178
0:5:27,58 --> 0:5:29,4
If you want to live a long life,

179
0:5:29,4 --> 0:5:30,7
In terms of your life,

180
0:5:30,7 --> 0:5:33,709
In the end, it will be reduced to a fraction of what it was.

181
0:5:33,709 --> 0:5:36,389
You might find yourself unable to control everything about you.

182
0:5:36,389 --> 0:5:38,2
In fact, that's often the case.

183
0:5:38,2 --> 0:5:39,6
When people reach their later years,

184
0:5:39,6 --> 0:5:40,18
the reality can be quite sad.

185
0:5:40,18 --> 0:5:41,88
So, live your best life while you're young.

186
0:5:41,88 --> 0:5:43,659
While you still have the energy and ability.

187
0:5:43,659 --> 0:5:46,279
Though I, Brother Rong, have always been the type who,

188
0:5:46,279 --> 0:5:48,59
doesn't recommend you to spend money recklessly,

189
0:5:48,59 --> 0:5:49,319
if you want to travel,

190
0:5:49,319 --> 0:5:51,399
go ahead and explore the world.

191
0:5:51,399 --> 0:5:51,939
It's okay

192
0:5:51,939 --> 0:5:54,58
Don't let the money you spent make you not want to go

193
0:5:54,58 --> 0:5:56,6
Money spent is gone, don't be upset

194
0:5:56,6 --> 0:5:57,36
We can always earn more

195
0:5:57,36 --> 0:5:58,52
If we don't have much money

196
0:5:58,52 --> 0:5:59,3
We can go on a motorcycle trip

197
0:5:59,3 --> 0:6:0,8
If that doesn't work out

198
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:1,48
We can go on a budget trip by bicycle

199
0:6:1,48 --> 0:6:2,6
It's all good

200
0:6:2,6 --> 0:6:4,96
A budget trip doesn't mean you have to take a business class seat

201
0:6:4,96 --> 0:6:6,1
Second-class seat

202
0:6:6,1 --> 0:6:7,6
is just like hard seat for people

203
0:6:7,6 --> 0:6:8,54
So, to talk about it

204
0:6:8,54 --> 0:6:11,94
you should take advantage of your good health and travel soon

205
0:6:11,94 --> 0:6:14,56
Bro Rong is currently dealing with something

206
0:6:14,56 --> 0:6:16,97
so I can't apply for that

207
0:6:16,97 --> 0:6:18,51
visa to certain places

208
0:6:18,51 --> 0:6:19,61
So, to put it simply

209
0:6:19,61 --> 0:6:22,33
because the immigration issue you're handling here

210
0:6:22,33 --> 0:6:23,45
you need to apply for a tourist visa again

211
0:6:23,45 --> 0:6:24,33
People will doubt you, though.

212
0:6:24,33 --> 0:6:25,81
How did you end up in the second quadrant?

213
0:6:25,81 --> 0:6:27,29
You have two aspects of thought.

214
0:6:27,29 --> 0:6:28,53
Are you planning to go dark?

215
0:6:28,53 --> 0:6:29,49
They won’t let you go.

216
0:6:29,49 --> 0:6:31,77
But I really want to travel to many places.

217
0:6:31,77 --> 0:6:35,1
However, there aren’t many opportunities right now.

218
0:6:35,1 --> 0:6:35,67
Just go for it.

219
0:6:35,67 --> 0:6:37,82
So life is full of regrets.

220
0:6:37,82 --> 0:6:39,42
Like when I was in my twenties,

221
0:6:39,42 --> 0:6:40,68
Back then, I wanted to go out

222
0:6:40,68 --> 0:6:41,7
I visited many places

223
0:6:41,7 --> 0:6:42,5
but I didn’t have money

224
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:44,3
so I couldn’t travel to more places

225
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:45,26
In my thirties

226
0:6:45,26 --> 0:6:46,26
I was tied down by family

227
0:6:46,26 --> 0:6:47,62
Actually, in my forties, I really wanted to go out

228
0:6:47,62 --> 0:6:49,14
but now I’m still tied down by family

229
0:6:49,14 --> 0:6:50,82
By the time I’m in my fifties, my health might not be as good

230
0:6:50,82 --> 0:6:52,2
And at sixty, it’s even more unrealistic

231
0:6:52,2 --> 0:6:52,6
Right or wrong

232
0:6:52,6 --> 0:6:53,56
So, to talk about it

233
0:6:53,56 --> 0:6:55,56
Take advantage of your youth

234
0:6:55,56 --> 0:6:56,74
Make more friends

235
0:6:56,74 --> 0:6:57,7
Go out more

236
0:6:57,7 --> 0:6:58,72
Get out more

237
0:6:58,72 --> 0:7:1,13
This can't really be called reckless, can it

238
0:7:1,13 --> 0:7:2,19
On the contrary, go out more

239
0:7:2,19 --> 0:7:5,9
It's about bringing harmony to your life

240
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:9,84
Isn't it about doing more activities that benefit your mind and body

241
0:7:9,84 --> 0:7:12,24
It's really great.

242
0:7:12,48 --> 0:7:13,76
Many things are just like that.

243
0:7:13,76 --> 0:7:15,2
It's about your subjective feeling.

244
0:7:15,2 --> 0:7:18,69
It doesn't match your objective circumstances.

245
0:7:18,69 --> 0:7:20,1
The advice others give you,

246
0:7:20,1 --> 0:7:22,1
well, it's not going to help much.

247
0:7:22,1 --> 0:7:24,1
What have you done subjectively?

248
0:7:24,1 --> 0:7:25,35
Actually, it doesn't work either.

249
0:7:25,35 --> 0:7:27,67
It's a matter of timing, fate, and luck.

250
0:7:27,67 --> 0:7:30,289
Often, you shouldn't take action at all.

251
0:7:30,289 --> 0:7:33,369
Often, you need to follow the natural course of things.

252
0:7:33,369 --> 0:7:36,45
It’s not always going to be an upward journey.

253
0:7:36,45 --> 0:7:38,79
Sometimes, it involves going downhill.

254
0:7:38,79 --> 0:7:39,97
When you’re on the decline,

255
0:7:39,97 --> 0:7:42,61
try to enjoy the gradual descent.

256
0:7:42,61 --> 0:7:43,89
It can actually be quite fun.

257
0:7:43,89 --> 0:7:44,48
Right?

258
0:7:44,48 --> 0:7:47,38
You’ll find that life has its ways of surprising you,

259
0:7:47,38 --> 0:7:51,4
and as you grow older, new joys will emerge.

260
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:51,8
As you age,

261
0:7:51,8 --> 0:7:54,78
You can delve into all sorts of mysterious events from ancient times

262
0:7:54,78 --> 0:7:56,94
Can you just stay inside and read books?

263
0:7:56,94 --> 0:7:59,94
When you're young, do more physically demanding activities

264
0:7:59,94 --> 0:8:1,5
Look at me now, I'm in great shape

265
0:8:1,5 --> 0:8:3,72
I sleep 14 to 16 hours a day

266
0:8:3,72 --> 0:8:5,8
I'm so exhausted

267
0:8:5,8 --> 0:8:7,38
I'm not sure if it's because I'm overweight

268
0:8:7,38 --> 0:8:9,35
or if it's due to my blood oxygen levels

269
0:8:9,35 --> 0:8:11,23
or if there's something else wrong with my body

270
0:8:11,23 --> 0:8:13,69
But anyway, I just want to sleep this much every day

271
0:8:13,69 --> 0:8:15,69
Of course, comparing ourselves to others can be really discouraging.

272
0:8:15,69 --> 0:8:18,31
After all, comparison is the thief of joy.

273
0:8:18,31 --> 0:8:21,79
So, don't go around comparing yourself to others for no reason.

274
0:8:21,79 --> 0:8:23,1
As long as you don't compare yourself to others,

275
0:8:23,1 --> 0:8:24,11
you're doing just fine.

276
0:8:24,11 --> 0:8:26,25
The core reason for me is that

277
0:8:26,25 --> 0:8:28,45
I always want to gain more followers,

278
0:8:28,45 --> 0:8:30,29
I always want to earn more income,

279
0:8:30,29 --> 0:8:32,95
I always want to maintain a high-income status,

280
0:8:32,95 --> 0:8:34,919
I always want to keep this going.

281
0:8:34,919 --> 0:8:37,779
But how can everything always move upwards?

282
0:8:37,779 --> 0:8:39,179
Towards a better direction?

283
0:8:39,179 --> 0:8:41,159
Sometimes you might just be at the end of your rope.

284
0:8:41,159 --> 0:8:42,659
Or you might be out of tricks.

285
0:8:42,659 --> 0:8:43,839
That's just how it is.

286
0:8:43,839 --> 0:8:45,27
So you need to accept it all.

287
0:8:45,27 --> 0:8:46,69
But if you force changes,

288
0:8:46,69 --> 0:8:47,83
Force reforms,

289
0:8:47,83 --> 0:8:48,59
Force alterations,

290
0:8:48,59 --> 0:8:50,71
Some things might end up worse than before.

291
0:8:50,71 --> 0:8:52,44
a state of slowly descending

292
0:8:52,44 --> 0:8:53,98
so when we talk about life

293
0:8:53,98 --> 0:8:55,96
of course, you should be proactive and strive forward

294
0:8:55,96 --> 0:8:57,1
how should we put it

295
0:8:57,1 --> 0:9:0,36
all sorts of challenges and struggles

296
0:9:0,36 --> 0:9:1,12
you should move forward

297
0:9:1,12 --> 0:9:1,56
keep moving forward

298
0:9:1,56 --> 0:9:2,18
if you need to hustle, then hustle

299
0:9:2,18 --> 0:9:3,68
but more importantly

300
0:9:3,68 --> 0:9:6,52
you need to understand that a person's energy has its limits

301
0:9:6,52 --> 0:9:8,66
Don't go by yourself

302
0:9:8,66 --> 0:9:10,2
Don't force yourself to go against the tide

303
0:9:10,2 --> 0:9:11,1
Wanting to change something

304
0:9:11,1 --> 0:9:12,86
Sometimes, in fact

305
0:9:12,86 --> 0:9:14,88
Going with the flow is the best approach

306
0:9:14,88 --> 0:9:16,27
Go with the flow

307
0:9:16,55 --> 0:9:17,75
Let it fall naturally

308
0:9:17,75 --> 0:9:18,87
Let it rise naturally

309
0:9:18,87 --> 0:9:21,11
If you grasp the pulse of the times

310
0:9:21,11 --> 0:9:22,63
There's still a chance for it to rise

311
0:9:22,63 --> 0:9:26,25
And some things just accumulate more slowly.

312
0:9:26,3 --> 0:9:27,67
The economy might not be doing well right now.

313
0:9:27,67 --> 0:9:28,91
So everyone finds it hard to make money.

314
0:9:28,91 --> 0:9:31,7
So sometimes a drop in revenue is quite normal.

315
0:9:31,7 --> 0:9:32,39
You can't say that because revenue has dropped,

316
0:9:32,39 --> 0:9:34,89
there must be something wrong with your content.

317
0:9:34,89 --> 0:9:36,85
You can't think he's cheating just because your wife is giving you less pocket money.

318
0:9:36,85 --> 0:9:37,93
Just because your wife is giving you less money doesn't mean she's cheating.

319
0:9:37,93 --> 0:9:38,49
That's how it is.

320
0:9:38,49 --> 0:9:39,43
In many cases,

321
0:9:39,43 --> 0:9:43,27
Subjective suspicions and speculations are unrealistic.

322
0:9:43,27 --> 0:9:46,55
And objectively, others observing you is also impractical.

323
0:9:46,55 --> 0:9:48,14
So, from both subjective and objective perspectives,

324
0:9:48,14 --> 0:9:51,2
it's impossible to know the true reality.

325
0:9:51,2 --> 0:9:52,34
The true reality remains a mystery.

326
0:9:52,34 --> 0:9:53,56
Only heaven knows.

327
0:9:53,56 --> 0:9:55,26
Therefore, in many situations, no matter what,

328
0:9:55,26 --> 0:9:57,64
subjectively, don't make foolish mistakes,

329
0:9:57,64 --> 0:9:59,54
and objectively, respect the facts.

330
0:9:59,54 --> 0:10:0,72
That's all there is to it.
