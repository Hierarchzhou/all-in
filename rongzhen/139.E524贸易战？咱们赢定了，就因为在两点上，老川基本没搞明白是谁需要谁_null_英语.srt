1
0:0:0,26 --> 0:0:0,98
Hey everyone,

2
0:0:0,98 --> 0:0:3,86
this is episode 524,

3
0:0:3,86 --> 0:0:6,22
I'm not quite sure if it's this one though.

4
0:0:6,22 --> 0:0:10,68
I just placed the last order on Meituan and the last one on Luckin Coffee.

5
0:0:10,68 --> 0:0:12,9
I'm trying to get everything done before the strong winds arrive.

6
0:0:12,9 --> 0:0:15,54
Now, the strong winds have already reached Zhangjiakou.

7
0:0:15,54 --> 0:0:21,619
They are expected to hit Beijing around seven o'clock.

8
0:0:21,619 --> 0:0:23,339
I shouldn't have to take care of the kids this week,

9
0:0:23,339 --> 0:0:24,619
since they don't need to come over.

10
0:0:24,619 --> 0:0:26,54
I think it should be a level 12 wind.

11
0:0:26,54 --> 0:0:28,54
I'm really, really excited.

12
0:0:28,54 --> 0:0:31,259
Beijing residents have already started on their social media circles,

13
0:0:31,259 --> 0:0:32,979
awaiting this big wind.

14
0:0:34,99 --> 0:0:35,459
I have plenty of food at home.

15
0:0:35,459 --> 0:0:37,19
Batteries and water, no worries.

16
0:0:37,19 --> 0:0:41,37
I've been working on a grand narrative these past couple of days.

17
0:0:41,37 --> 0:0:43,36
The blogger has been talking about the trade war recently.

18
0:0:43,36 --> 0:0:45,8
Actually, everyone has been following the trade war.

19
0:0:45,8 --> 0:0:46,2
A lot of people are doing it

20
0:0:46,2 --> 0:0:47,6
The traffic is really good

21
0:0:47,6 --> 0:0:48,24
With tens of thousands

22
0:0:48,24 --> 0:0:49,129
Even over a hundred thousand

23
0:0:49,129 --> 0:0:50,349
And some have over a million

24
0:0:50,349 --> 0:0:53,79
But most people are just quoting authorities

25
0:0:53,79 --> 0:0:55,39
Or telling stories and such

26
0:0:55,39 --> 0:0:56,95
Without getting into specific details

27
0:0:56,95 --> 0:0:59,31
So I'll just focus on two points

28
0:0:59,31 --> 0:1:2,51
Firstly, we are definitely going to win this trade war.

29
0:1:2,51 --> 0:1:3,35
We will definitely win.

30
0:1:3,35 --> 0:1:4,51
No need to worry too much.

31
0:1:4,51 --> 0:1:8,36
Secondly, why will the U.S. lose?

32
0:1:8,36 --> 0:1:9,8
It's quite simple.

33
0:1:9,8 --> 0:1:10,4
I'll try to keep it as simple as possible.

34
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:14,1
Because the U.S. has two major cognitive errors.

35
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:18,16
One is that their imports are high,

36
0:1:18,16 --> 0:1:19,18
and their exports are low.

37
0:1:19,18 --> 0:1:20,44
It's a trade deficit.

38
0:1:20,44 --> 0:1:21,89
So we're more anxious about it.

39
0:1:21,89 --> 0:1:22,79
This is the first point.

40
0:1:22,79 --> 0:1:23,17
Secondly,

41
0:1:23,17 --> 0:1:25,65
It's Old Cuan's view that this tariff

42
0:1:25,65 --> 0:1:29,229
it's China that's paying this tariff.

43
0:1:29,229 --> 0:1:31,189
First, let's be clear and straightforward.

44
0:1:31,189 --> 0:1:33,109
The faster I explain this, the better.

45
0:1:33,109 --> 0:1:36,509
Because, first and foremost, it's the importer on the other side who pays.

46
0:1:36,509 --> 0:1:39,429
So why does China export so much?

47
0:1:39,429 --> 0:1:42,589
Actually, a lot of the time, American manufacturers

48
0:1:42,589 --> 0:1:46,33
need China for production, packaging, or mold making

49
0:1:46,33 --> 0:1:47,53
or to produce certain items

50
0:1:47,53 --> 0:1:50,64
they need China to handle these tasks

51
0:1:50,64 --> 0:1:54,26
but the final products are still made in the U.S.

52
0:1:54,26 --> 0:1:55,75
For example, if you want to create a perfume

53
0:1:55,75 --> 0:1:57,69
you might have China manufacture the perfume bottles

54
0:1:57,69 --> 0:2:0,44
or if you want to produce a toy or something similar

55
0:2:0,44 --> 0:2:1,8
You handle the design

56
0:2:1,8 --> 0:2:2,8
and China helps with the production

57
0:2:2,8 --> 0:2:4,54
so that you can ultimately sell for a higher price

58
0:2:4,54 --> 0:2:7,62
or, for example, the cost of his product

59
0:2:7,62 --> 0:2:9,579
is one dollar when sold in China

60
0:2:9,579 --> 0:2:11,199
but now it sells for two dollars

61
0:2:11,199 --> 0:2:13,37
yet its final selling price is sixteen dollars

62
0:2:13,37 --> 0:2:14,41
so in this case

63
0:2:14,41 --> 0:2:16,85
it’s actually the American small and medium-sized enterprises that are taking a hit

64
0:2:16,85 --> 0:2:17,81
industries like manufacturing

65
0:2:17,81 --> 0:2:19,74
and large companies like Apple

66
0:2:19,74 --> 0:2:20,78
places like Tesla

67
0:2:20,78 --> 0:2:21,9
We talked about this issue last time

68
0:2:21,9 --> 0:2:25,859
Secondly, it's the U.S. importers who pay the tariffs on their goods

69
0:2:25,859 --> 0:2:27,239
once they arrive at U.S. ports

70
0:2:27,239 --> 0:2:29,61
and then they are held there

71
0:2:29,61 --> 0:2:31,31
and you have to pay the fees

72
0:2:31,31 --> 0:2:32,37
before they can be released

73
0:2:32,37 --> 0:2:32,89
That's it.

74
0:2:32,89 --> 0:2:34,13
It's about customs clearance.

75
0:2:34,13 --> 0:2:35,14
That's how it is.

76
0:2:35,14 --> 0:2:36,1
So, to explain it,

77
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:37,34
From our perspective,

78
0:2:37,34 --> 0:2:39,58
There's nothing that absolutely has to be from the U.S.

79
0:2:39,58 --> 0:2:42,29
I had a knife sharpener that featured ONiON from the game.

80
0:2:42,29 --> 0:2:45,77
Later, the ONiON's knife sharpener broke after being used fewer than five or six times.

81
0:2:45,77 --> 0:2:46,81
Later, I bought one.

82
0:2:46,81 --> 0:2:49,14
And then the exact same one

83
0:2:49,14 --> 0:2:51,72
That one is a knockoff, a Chinese OEM product

84
0:2:51,72 --> 0:2:53,14
Because it’s from their contract manufacturer

85
0:2:53,14 --> 0:2:56,83
It’s common for contract manufacturers to pick a new brand and start producing again

86
0:2:56,83 --> 0:2:58,47
So you see a lot of things are like this

87
0:2:58,47 --> 0:3:1,38
The original brand might be gone

88
0:3:1,38 --> 0:3:4,38
Nowadays, what’s being sold might just be from the former contract factories

89
0:3:4,38 --> 0:3:6,22
So what are you afraid of if the factory is still here

90
0:3:6,22 --> 0:3:7,3
It’s just like playing Civilization

91
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:8,18
You have productive force.

92
0:3:8,18 --> 0:3:9,14
You have the little gear

93
0:3:9,14 --> 0:3:10,4
And the blue shield as well

94
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:11,86
This thing is really useful

95
0:3:11,86 --> 0:3:13,88
Because the factory here just needs one design

96
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:17,32
If you completely tear up and disconnect our ties now

97
0:3:17,32 --> 0:3:18,89
Then

98
0:3:18,89 --> 0:3:20,9
We won't have any intellectual property issues

99
0:3:20,9 --> 0:3:21,969
And we can freely replicate the items

100
0:3:21,969 --> 0:3:23,26
We can do whatever we want

101
0:3:23,26 --> 0:3:25,2
Your product design drawings

102
0:3:25,2 --> 0:3:26,6
All the raw materials are here

103
0:3:28,1 --> 0:3:28,82
Right?

104
0:3:28,82 --> 0:3:29,3
I

105
0:3:29,3 --> 0:3:30,52
And the most important thing is

106
0:3:30,52 --> 0:3:34,12
It doesn't matter if you have trade barriers with me

107
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:35,88
We can export to Canada

108
0:3:35,88 --> 0:3:37,0
Or to Mexico

109
0:3:37,0 --> 0:3:37,4
Right?

110
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:40,58
You could smuggle or resell to Mexico and Canada.

111
0:3:40,58 --> 0:3:42,56
Just like you import gasoline into Russia.

112
0:3:42,56 --> 0:3:44,66
Like oil and natural gas.

113
0:3:44,66 --> 0:3:47,64
It’s just a matter of middlemen.

114
0:3:47,64 --> 0:3:49,58
India, the largest country in the East.

115
0:3:49,58 --> 0:3:51,78
He’s raking in the profits, right?

116
0:3:51,78 --> 0:3:53,4
It just means more middlemen.

117
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:57,429
So, one of the most profitable jobs now might be going to Mexico.

118
0:3:57,429 --> 0:3:58,569
Selling products to the U.S.

119
0:3:59,609 --> 0:4:0,289
So that's how it is.

120
0:4:0,289 --> 0:4:1,569
He didn't figure it out.

121
0:4:1,569 --> 0:4:3,689
Not Chinese, though.

122
0:4:3,689 --> 0:4:7,7
The 16 dollars I sell to the U.S. isn't mine.

123
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:8,65
I make that one dollar.

124
0:4:8,65 --> 0:4:9,75
Now, to put it this way,

125
0:4:9,75 --> 0:4:10,91
I still make that one dollar.

126
0:4:10,91 --> 0:4:13,84
It's just that the additional cost of one dollar is on you.

127
0:4:13,84 --> 0:4:17,32
Then you earn 16-15 from what you made before 16

128
0:4:17,32 --> 0:4:19,4
which turns into 15-14

129
0:4:19,4 --> 0:4:22,42
meaning the extra money from the reduced tariff

130
0:4:22,42 --> 0:4:24,66
is actually one hundred percent from China

131
0:4:24,66 --> 0:4:27,48
the export cost here has increased by 104%

132
0:4:27,48 --> 0:4:28,5
around 125

133
0:4:28,5 --> 0:4:29,22
it doesn’t matter

134
0:4:29,22 --> 0:4:31,18
isn’t it already one and a quarter?

135
0:4:31,18 --> 0:4:32,54
it’s all good

136
0:4:32,54 --> 0:4:34,58
This small amount of money really doesn’t matter.

137
0:4:34,58 --> 0:4:37,14
It’s just that you don’t have the capability to produce it.

138
0:4:37,14 --> 0:4:38,78
You still have to buy Chinese-made products.

139
0:4:38,78 --> 0:4:42,51
Moreover, when comparing Chinese-made products to American-made ones,

140
0:4:42,51 --> 0:4:43,57
the service,

141
0:4:43,57 --> 0:4:44,45
the quality,

142
0:4:44,45 --> 0:4:45,31
various aspects,

143
0:4:45,31 --> 0:4:47,31
the difference isn’t just tenfold,

144
0:4:47,31 --> 0:4:49,63
it’s more like twentyfold.

145
0:4:49,63 --> 0:4:51,19
So, if you're off by 20 times,

146
0:4:51,19 --> 0:4:55,4
you might set the tariff to 3000% or 5000%,

147
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:55,96
which would be better.

148
0:4:55,96 --> 0:4:57,12
But if you do that,

149
0:4:57,12 --> 0:4:59,24
there would be too many smugglers.

150
0:4:59,24 --> 0:5:2,3
People would flood in from Canada and Mexico,

151
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:4,909
and the Chinese communities in Canada and Mexico would thrive.

152
0:5:4,909 --> 0:5:7,469
So, the best strategy now,

153
0:5:7,469 --> 0:5:9,249
is to immigrate to Canada as soon as possible.

154
0:5:9,249 --> 0:5:10,97
Sell things to the United States

155
0:5:10,97 --> 0:5:12,93
Or hurry up and go to Mexico

156
0:5:12,93 --> 0:5:14,53
Mexico should be visa-free or something, right?

157
0:5:14,53 --> 0:5:16,13
Or has that been paused recently?

158
0:5:16,13 --> 0:5:18,65
Anyway, for going to Canada or Mexico, you use this NEFA

159
0:5:20,47 --> 0:5:21,27
To deal with it

160
0:5:21,27 --> 0:5:24,37
It’s like when there’s a trade barrier between China and the U.S.

161
0:5:24,37 --> 0:5:27,13
And if there’s a free trade zone between China, Japan, and South Korea

162
0:5:27,13 --> 0:5:30,31
There will definitely be a demand from Chinese people

163
0:5:30,31 --> 0:5:32,83
You can sell American products from Japan and South Korea to China.

164
0:5:32,83 --> 0:5:34,74
Just slap on a Japanese or Korean label, and it’s done.

165
0:5:34,74 --> 0:5:35,9
But the most important thing is,

166
0:5:35,9 --> 0:5:40,0
the demand for American products in China isn’t high.

167
0:5:40,0 --> 0:5:42,36
Watching some pirated movies at night is enough.

168
0:5:42,36 --> 0:5:42,76
Right?

169
0:5:42,76 --> 0:5:44,8
You're not going to the cinema to watch The Avengers

170
0:5:44,8 --> 0:5:46,38
I just watch it online, and it’s done.

171
0:5:46,38 --> 0:5:50,29
What about Steam? Isn’t that the case for Steam as well?

172
0:5:50,29 --> 0:5:52,5
So, does that mean pirated games can't be played?

173
0:5:52,5 --> 0:5:52,25
Right?

174
0:5:52,25 --> 0:5:53,93
He can't completely do that, right?

175
0:5:53,93 --> 0:5:56,66
And I'm not in the China region on Steam anymore.

176
0:5:57,68 --> 0:5:59,34
I've taken my Steam account abroad.

177
0:5:59,34 --> 0:5:59,62
Right?

178
0:5:59,62 --> 0:6:0,78
It doesn't really affect you, does it?

179
0:6:0,78 --> 0:6:1,62
Right?

180
0:6:1,62 --> 0:6:3,9
Actually, it doesn't really have much of an impact.

181
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:5,5
The price of the iPhone hasn't gone up.

182
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:7,78
Because the demand in the domestic market remains unchanged.

183
0:6:7,78 --> 0:6:10,1
And that demand is real and present.

184
0:6:10,1 --> 0:6:13,1
It's not entirely about the end consumer.

185
0:6:13,1 --> 0:6:14,14
A fivefold trade deficit.

186
0:6:14,14 --> 0:6:14,78
No, that's not the case.

187
0:6:14,78 --> 0:6:16,49
It's not the end consumer.

188
0:6:16,49 --> 0:6:18,7
Many are manufacturers.

189
0:6:18,7 --> 0:6:19,35
We provide raw materials.

190
0:6:19,35 --> 0:6:21,15
We're not the providers of finished products.

191
0:6:21,15 --> 0:6:25,0
We're the partners in raw materials or intermediate stages.

192
0:6:25,0 --> 0:6:28,429
So ultimately, it impacts and harms American industry and commerce.

193
0:6:28,709 --> 0:6:30,29
It's that simple.

194
0:6:30,29 --> 0:6:32,69
It affects American industry and commerce.

195
0:6:32,69 --> 0:6:33,629
China is the supply chain.

196
0:6:33,629 --> 0:6:34,629
Supply chain.

197
0:6:34,629 --> 0:6:35,549
It's that straightforward.

198
0:6:35,549 --> 0:6:38,43
So they think China sells only products.

199
0:6:38,43 --> 0:6:40,85
Have you managed to get Chinese cars running on American roads?

200
0:6:40,85 --> 0:6:43,35
Did you get a Chinese-made computer to run in America?

201
0:6:43,35 --> 0:6:44,79
Do you want Chinese-manufactured weapons

202
0:6:44,79 --> 0:6:45,95
Did small arms go on the run in America?

203
0:6:45,95 --> 0:6:46,91
No, right?

204
0:6:46,91 --> 0:6:48,15
There have always been bans.

205
0:6:48,15 --> 0:6:49,49
There used to be.

206
0:6:49,49 --> 0:6:50,49
But not anymore.

207
0:6:50,49 --> 0:6:51,61
The honeymoon period is over, right?

208
0:6:51,61 --> 0:6:52,65
The honeymoon period of the 80s is over.

209
0:6:52,65 --> 0:6:54,74
There's been no more selling of dog weapons or anything like that.

210
0:6:58,62 --> 0:6:59,6
He didn't figure it out.

211
0:6:59,6 --> 0:7:1,33
So many people, you know,

212
0:7:1,33 --> 0:7:4,1
Especially a lot of people who are quite Americanized,

213
0:7:4,1 --> 0:7:7,11
They just say,

214
0:7:7,11 --> 0:7:8,17
Trump has great wisdom.

215
0:7:8,17 --> 0:7:10,42
His team are all professional economists.

216
0:7:10,42 --> 0:7:11,68
Aren't they more knowledgeable than you?

217
0:7:11,68 --> 0:7:13,929
So, who is VR?

218
0:7:13,929 --> 0:7:14,909
You get it too, huh?

219
0:7:14,909 --> 0:7:15,649
Hehe

220
0:7:15,649 --> 0:7:16,949
So, in many cases,

221
0:7:16,949 --> 0:7:19,36
Old Cui seems to be unclear about tariffs,

222
0:7:19,36 --> 0:7:21,92
thinking that tariffs aren't that straightforward,

223
0:7:21,92 --> 0:7:24,27
believing that it's the foreign government paying the bill,

224
0:7:27,15 --> 0:7:28,89
the Chinese sell finished products,

225
0:7:28,89 --> 0:7:30,679
and Americans also sell finished goods,

226
0:7:30,679 --> 0:7:32,159
but it's not that simple,

227
0:7:32,159 --> 0:7:33,39
in many cases,

228
0:7:33,39 --> 0:7:35,539
we might need American cooperation in certain areas,

229
0:7:35,539 --> 0:7:36,319
but to be honest,

230
0:7:36,319 --> 0:7:38,51
there aren't many areas where we need their cooperation,

231
0:7:38,51 --> 0:7:40,31
the U.S. needs more cooperation from China,

232
0:7:40,31 --> 0:7:42,11
because Chinese products are affordable and of good quality,

233
0:7:42,11 --> 0:7:44,44
and they ship very quickly,

234
0:7:44,44 --> 0:7:45,96
without any unnecessary hassle,

235
0:7:45,96 --> 0:7:47,32
many American manufacturers,

236
0:7:47,32 --> 0:7:48,95
they also need to collaborate with others,

237
0:7:48,95 --> 0:7:50,19
for producing packaging materials,

238
0:7:50,19 --> 0:7:51,63
producing various products,

239
0:7:51,63 --> 0:7:52,39
they have a design,

240
0:7:52,39 --> 0:7:52,91
they have an idea,

241
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:54,17
and they realize it in China,

242
0:7:54,17 --> 0:7:56,59
so the ones getting hurt are their own industrial and business owners,

243
0:7:56,59 --> 0:7:58,52
so once this is understood, it's all clear,

244
0:7:58,52 --> 0:8:0,8
so we will definitely win this trade war,

245
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:1,4
because the ones losing are them.
