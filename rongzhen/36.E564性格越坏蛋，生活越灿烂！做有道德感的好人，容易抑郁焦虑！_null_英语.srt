0:0:0,2 --> 0:0:2,36
Hey, this is the first time we're recording from this angle.

2
0:0:2,36 --> 0:0:3,84
Today, Brother Long will chat with you about

3
0:0:3,84 --> 0:0:6,64
the more wicked a person is,

4
0:0:6,64 --> 0:0:8,62
the easier their life becomes.

5
0:0:8,62 --> 0:0:9,8
Um,

6
0:0:9,8 --> 0:0:11,84
I recently took a personality test on Douyin,

7
0:0:11,84 --> 0:0:14,6
and this personality test costs 29 yuan.

8
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:16,65
Of course, when we talk about any psychological test,

9
0:0:16,65 --> 0:0:17,41
or IQ test

10
0:0:17,41 --> 0:0:20,71
Personality tests shouldn’t be done so casually.

11
0:0:20,71 --> 0:0:22,39
Selecting a few questions won’t give you accurate results.

12
0:0:22,39 --> 0:0:23,37
This thing isn’t reliable.

13
0:0:23,37 --> 0:0:25,7
If you want to test your personality,

14
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:25,81
test your genes,

15
0:0:25,81 --> 0:0:27,81
or for the best IQ test, go to a hospital.

16
0:0:27,81 --> 0:0:29,86
Doing a test that costs a few thousand dollars,

17
0:0:29,86 --> 0:0:32,38
that one tends to be more accurate.

18
0:0:32,38 --> 0:0:34,4
This personality test is also something like that.

19
0:0:34,4 --> 0:0:36,4
I knew what the outcome would be.

20
0:0:36,4 --> 0:0:38,32
So I deliberately played it that way.

21
0:0:38,32 --> 0:0:42,22
Everyone can see that my test result indicates I have a narcissistic personality.

22
0:0:42,22 --> 0:0:46,18
Combined with antisocial and histrionic personality traits.

23
0:0:46,18 --> 0:0:47,3
Of course, to put it bluntly,

24
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:50,67
these three personality types are what people despise as scum.

25
0:0:50,67 --> 0:0:52,57
But in practice,

26
0:0:52,57 --> 0:0:54,95
you'll find in Chinese society,

27
0:0:54,95 --> 0:0:58,43
these three types, or a combination of them,

28
0:0:58,43 --> 0:1:1,22
This kind of person is rather indifferent.

29
0:1:1,22 --> 0:1:3,38
But they make themselves very comfortable.

30
0:1:3,38 --> 0:1:5,18
Such people will never become depressed.

31
0:1:5,18 --> 0:1:5,66
Why is that?

32
0:1:5,66 --> 0:1:6,22
Let me tell you.

33
0:1:6,22 --> 0:1:8,17
Because a narcissistic personality,

34
0:1:8,17 --> 0:1:12,7
it creates a particularly strong shield for their confidence.

35
0:1:12,7 --> 0:1:14,54
Everything is always someone else's fault.

36
0:1:14,54 --> 0:1:16,44
Trump is just such a person.

37
0:1:16,84 --> 0:1:21,28
An antisocial personality, as long as they respect the rule of law

38
0:1:21,28 --> 0:1:22,76
can be a law-abiding citizen

39
0:1:22,76 --> 0:1:24,3
and there won’t be much of an issue

40
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:26,98
But what’s a characteristic of an antisocial personality?

41
0:1:26,98 --> 0:1:31,92
It’s the tendency to use mental or physical strength to challenge authority

42
0:1:31,92 --> 0:1:33,4
to defy everyone

43
0:1:33,4 --> 0:1:34,6
This is what’s known as a reactive personality

44
0:1:34,6 --> 0:1:35,43
an antisocial personality

45
0:1:35,43 --> 0:1:37,91
And when it comes to a histrionic personality

46
0:1:37,91 --> 0:1:40,55
You'll encounter all sorts of obstacles in reality

47
0:1:40,55 --> 0:1:41,27
all kinds of enemies

48
0:1:41,27 --> 0:1:42,43
all sorts of people

49
0:1:42,43 --> 0:1:43,27
who doubt you

50
0:1:43,27 --> 0:1:44,5
who slander you

51
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:46,11
you just brush it off

52
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:47,31
with a grin

53
0:1:47,31 --> 0:1:48,45
yeah, sure

54
0:1:48,45 --> 0:1:49,77
to deal with such people

55
0:1:49,77 --> 0:1:52,87
Smoothly dodging all these attacks

56
0:1:52,87 --> 0:1:54,76
So you love to act

57
0:1:54,76 --> 0:1:58,1
And this person also likes to plot against others

58
0:1:58,1 --> 0:1:59,5
And you’re narcissistic

59
0:1:59,5 --> 0:2:3,98
This will provide excellent protection for your personal image

60
0:2:4,22 --> 0:2:6,72
To deal with a boss with NPD

61
0:2:6,72 --> 0:2:7,94
A parent with NPD

62
0:2:7,94 --> 0:2:9,86
You have to become like them

63
0:2:9,86 --> 0:2:12,22
Just as narcissistic as they are

64
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:13,22
Violence

65
0:2:13,22 --> 0:2:15,54
It becomes more, how to say, sophisticated

66
0:2:15,54 --> 0:2:18,4
You become more cautious and cunning

67
0:2:18,4 --> 0:2:19,45
This is the safest approach

68
0:2:19,45 --> 0:2:23,68
Like Jia Xu and Sima Yi working for Cao Cao

69
0:2:23,68 --> 0:2:25,56
When you're facing a boss like Cao Cao

70
0:2:25,56 --> 0:2:26,84
What can you do about it?

71
0:2:26,84 --> 0:2:27,12
Right?

72
0:2:27,12 --> 0:2:30,5
You have to be even more calculating

73
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:30,95
More sinister

74
0:2:30,95 --> 0:2:32,77
Because he is a very suspicious person

75
0:2:32,77 --> 0:2:34,35
But this person has a good side

76
0:2:34,35 --> 0:2:35,12
Right?

77
0:2:35,12 --> 0:2:37,46
Unifying the three kingdoms was the foundation he laid

78
0:2:42,219 --> 0:2:47,0
Rong’s personality often avoids situations that would make me depressed

79
0:2:47,0 --> 0:2:49,36
Because once something goes wrong

80
0:2:49,36 --> 0:2:51,66
I’m definitely the first to point out others’ mistakes

81
0:2:51,66 --> 0:2:55,19
I would never look for reasons within myself

82
0:2:55,19 --> 0:2:57,83
Unless it's something only I can do

83
0:2:57,83 --> 0:2:58,91
if there's an outcome

84
0:2:58,91 --> 0:3:0,49
or if I don’t collaborate with anyone

85
0:3:0,49 --> 0:3:3,48
then I would attribute it to bad timing

86
0:3:3,48 --> 0:3:7,839
haha, it must be that the heavens don't want me to make a move right now

87
0:3:7,839 --> 0:3:9,779
don't want me to suffer a setback

88
0:3:9,779 --> 0:3:11,799
so speaking of luck

89
0:3:11,799 --> 0:3:14,33
if it's bad, I would attribute it to luck

90
0:3:14,33 --> 0:3:18,83
so I will never blame myself for everything

91
0:3:18,83 --> 0:3:21,18
Today I was chatting with a friend.

92
0:3:21,18 --> 0:3:23,34
He's a classic example of something.

93
0:3:23,34 --> 0:3:25,46
A classic self-destructive personality.

94
0:3:25,46 --> 0:3:27,86
Recently, during a job hunt,

95
0:3:27,86 --> 0:3:30,6
he encountered a boss who seemed like a scammer.

96
0:3:30,6 --> 0:3:32,6
The boss’s company looked quite suspicious,

97
0:3:32,6 --> 0:3:34,38
and he’s not even the legal representative.

98
0:3:34,38 --> 0:3:37,44
Yet, he uses the company to engage in all sorts of fraudulent activities.

99
0:3:37,44 --> 0:3:39,26
So, he suspects this person is a scammer.

100
0:3:39,26 --> 0:3:41,89
Then it escalated into a verbal fight.

101
0:3:41,89 --> 0:3:42,169
I told him,

102
0:3:42,169 --> 0:3:43,329
There's no need to engage in a shouting match.

103
0:3:43,329 --> 0:3:45,249
Just stay calm and do nothing.

104
0:3:45,249 --> 0:3:47,49
Just ignore the person.

105
0:3:47,49 --> 0:3:49,31
But he still ended up arguing with the other person.

106
0:3:49,31 --> 0:3:52,99
Later, it turned out that the other person might not have been a scammer after all.

107
0:3:52,99 --> 0:3:55,45
Of course, I still think the other person was a scammer.

108
0:3:55,45 --> 0:3:57,8
He felt like he had offended the wrong person.

109
0:3:57,8 --> 0:3:59,38
draining oneself over and over again

110
0:3:59,38 --> 0:4:1,28
and then wondering if you've offended someone

111
0:4:1,28 --> 0:4:3,31
feeling that the day is just ruined

112
0:4:3,31 --> 0:4:5,91
in fact, all these personality traits

113
0:4:5,91 --> 0:4:8,75
you'll eventually realize they are merely tools for exploitation

114
0:4:8,75 --> 0:4:9,7
survival tools

115
0:4:9,7 --> 0:4:12,18
not something that exists innately

116
0:4:12,18 --> 0:4:15,16
let's talk about Western psychological analysis

117
0:4:15,16 --> 0:4:16,3
and sociological theories

118
0:4:16,3 --> 0:4:18,4
It has its own flaws as well.

119
0:4:18,4 --> 0:4:21,299
So don't regard these personality types

120
0:4:21,299 --> 0:4:22,699
or these tendencies

121
0:4:22,699 --> 0:4:26,379
or the various traumas from different so-called family backgrounds

122
0:4:26,379 --> 0:4:29,55
as if they were the end of the world.

123
0:4:29,55 --> 0:4:31,79
For instance, for those of us who are more narcissistic

124
0:4:31,79 --> 0:4:34,159
we have an unshakeable confidence.

125
0:4:34,159 --> 0:4:38,539
This unshakeable confidence is incredibly vital in today's society.

126
0:4:38,539 --> 0:4:41,48
Once your confidence can be easily shaken by others

127
0:4:41,48 --> 0:4:43,8
Others will definitely criticize him

128
0:4:43,8 --> 0:4:44,1
That's how it is

129
0:4:44,1 --> 0:4:46,89
So if you have this extremely narcissistic personality

130
0:4:46,89 --> 0:4:49,87
Your confidence is basically in an unshakable state

131
0:4:49,87 --> 0:4:51,65
I am a legend

132
0:4:51,65 --> 0:4:53,15
Everything is always someone else's fault

133
0:4:53,15 --> 0:4:56,5
So paradoxically, it can lead to success

134
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:57,47
It can also lead down the path of being a scoundrel

135
0:4:57,47 --> 0:4:59,53
Because in this society

136
0:4:59,53 --> 0:5:1,14
There are plenty of hypocrites

137
0:5:1,14 --> 0:5:5,52
In our Chinese society, what prevails is the traditional Confucian morality

138
0:5:5,52 --> 0:5:9,27
Many people appear to be morally upright on the surface

139
0:5:9,27 --> 0:5:11,6
But they do all sorts of dirty deeds behind the scenes

140
0:5:11,6 --> 0:5:13,28
Yet everyone is eager to put on a show

141
0:5:13,28 --> 0:5:15,8
Because in this context

142
0:5:15,8 --> 0:5:17,72
Moral performance artists are the most popular

143
0:5:17,72 --> 0:5:20,47
Don't believe me? Just look at Zong Qinghou

144
0:5:20,47 --> 0:5:23,44
You must always fly economy class

145
0:5:23,44 --> 0:5:25,32
Not a single cent should be given to foreigners

146
0:5:25,32 --> 0:5:26,62
Look how well the performance is

147
0:5:26,62 --> 0:5:29,93
But in the end, it turns out all the kids are foreigners

148
0:5:29,93 --> 0:5:32,29
We can talk about these things

149
0:5:32,29 --> 0:5:34,91
All these things are talk without action

150
0:5:34,91 --> 0:5:36,27
Those who do can't talk

151
0:5:36,27 --> 0:5:37,19
It's always like this

152
0:5:37,19 --> 0:5:38,91
Then look at antisocial personalities

153
0:5:38,91 --> 0:5:42,659
You'll find that in reality, many people use their power to suppress others, right

154
0:5:42,659 --> 0:5:44,179
He uses his experience to overpower you

155
0:5:44,179 --> 0:5:45,579
He uses his gender to overpower you

156
0:5:45,579 --> 0:5:46,799
But in reality, it's all nonsense

157
0:5:46,799 --> 0:5:47,48
Right?

158
0:5:47,48 --> 0:5:48,64
It's all nonsense

159
0:5:48,64 --> 0:5:50,52
Traditional society gives you all sorts of things

160
0:5:50,52 --> 0:5:51,84
Making you think you're really something

161
0:5:51,84 --> 0:5:53,62
But in fact, you're nothing

162
0:5:53,62 --> 0:5:55,5
So if you have antisocial personality disorder

163
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:57,58
You won’t be intimidated by any authority

164
0:5:57,58 --> 0:5:58,46
or leaders

165
0:5:58,46 --> 0:5:59,66
or power

166
0:5:59,66 --> 0:6:3,74
You’re nobody, how can you command me? Can you really command me?

167
0:6:3,74 --> 0:6:7,74
Isn’t it clear that we’re not in the same system?

168
0:6:7,74 --> 0:6:8,66
How can you command me?

169
0:6:8,66 --> 0:6:8,94
Right?

170
0:6:8,94 --> 0:6:10,14
If you command me, I won’t comply

171
0:6:10,14 --> 0:6:11,34
I’ll just leave this system

172
0:6:11,34 --> 0:6:12,95
Weren't you insulting me in the group?

173
0:6:12,95 --> 0:6:14,3
Either I kick you out

174
0:6:14,3 --> 0:6:14,95
Or I leave the group

175
0:6:14,95 --> 0:6:15,65
It's that simple

176
0:6:15,65 --> 0:6:16,67
For me, leaving the group is all it takes

177
0:6:16,67 --> 0:6:17,28
Right?

178
0:6:17,28 --> 0:6:18,6
So often it's like this

179
0:6:18,6 --> 0:6:19,76
The more antisocial you are

180
0:6:19,76 --> 0:6:21,54
The less society can do to you

181
0:6:21,54 --> 0:6:23,5
So it might not be such a bad thing.

182
0:6:23,5 --> 0:6:24,1
Antisocial personality.

183
0:6:24,1 --> 0:6:24,86
As long as you don't kill.

184
0:6:24,86 --> 0:6:25,58
Don't commit murder or arson.

185
0:6:25,58 --> 0:6:27,7
Generally speaking, there's not much of an issue.

186
0:6:27,7 --> 0:6:29,12
Now, let's talk about histrionic personality.

187
0:6:29,12 --> 0:6:31,99
Do you think there's nothing in this society that doesn't need to be acted out?

188
0:6:31,99 --> 0:6:33,83
Actually, if you tell the truth,

189
0:6:33,83 --> 0:6:35,47
Do you think many people can accept it?

190
0:6:35,47 --> 0:6:36,83
Bro Rong often tells the truth

191
0:6:36,83 --> 0:6:38,0
Bro Rong often gets scolded

192
0:6:38,0 --> 0:6:39,96
Some people just can't handle the truth

193
0:6:39,96 --> 0:6:42,8
But your core true followers are acceptable.

194
0:6:42,8 --> 0:6:45,32
However, when it comes to the general public

195
0:6:45,32 --> 0:6:47,31
Do you really need to speak your mind?

196
0:6:47,31 --> 0:6:48,91
Speaking the truth comes at a cost

197
0:6:48,91 --> 0:6:50,39
So most of the time

198
0:6:50,39 --> 0:6:52,33
You just say something vague

199
0:6:52,33 --> 0:6:54,13
Speaking half-truths

200
0:6:54,13 --> 0:6:55,69
is the safest way to go

201
0:6:55,69 --> 0:6:58,53
So when talking about narcissistic personality

202
0:6:58,53 --> 0:7:2,5
antisocial personality combined with histrionic personality is a really messed-up combination

203
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:5,1
but in reality, it works

204
0:7:5,1 --> 0:7:6,6
What is pragmatism?

205
0:7:6,6 --> 0:7:9,6
Pragmatism is about what works effectively.

206
0:7:9,6 --> 0:7:9,9
without suffering

207
0:7:9,9 --> 0:7:12,88
Look at how many people can't handle life and end up taking their own lives

208
0:7:12,88 --> 0:7:13,46
Right?

209
0:7:13,46 --> 0:7:15,86
How many people feel anxious because they can't do certain things well?

210
0:7:15,86 --> 0:7:18,36
How many people are trapped in obsessive thoughts?

211
0:7:18,36 --> 0:7:19,94
How many people have a people-pleasing personality?

212
0:7:19,94 --> 0:7:21,5
How many people have a confrontational personality?

213
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:22,76
It's that scary.

214
0:7:22,76 --> 0:7:23,8
There's no benefit at all.

215
0:7:23,8 --> 0:7:24,96
He just has to do these things.

216
0:7:24,96 --> 0:7:25,62
Why?

217
0:7:25,62 --> 0:7:27,3
Because Confucian thinkers

218
0:7:27,3 --> 0:7:30,2
the school system has solidified his mindset

219
0:7:30,2 --> 0:7:30,92
these ideas

220
0:7:30,92 --> 0:7:32,66
he has a mindset of an employee

221
0:7:32,66 --> 0:7:33,86
it's a lower-level mindset

222
0:7:33,86 --> 0:7:36,1
so he can't advance

223
0:7:36,1 --> 0:7:37,15
it's that simple

224
0:7:37,15 --> 0:7:38,89
when you have the mindset of a boss

225
0:7:38,89 --> 0:7:40,77
when you're in a superior position

226
0:7:40,77 --> 0:7:43,53
your presence and aura are different from others

227
0:7:43,53 --> 0:7:44,67
you attract the opposite sex

228
0:7:44,67 --> 0:7:47,35
and this has nothing to do with other factors

229
0:7:47,35 --> 0:7:49,17
many people are quite simple

230
0:7:49,17 --> 0:7:50,67
relying on physical attractiveness when young

231
0:7:50,67 --> 0:7:51,81
thinking it can attract others

232
0:7:51,81 --> 0:7:53,47
but as you get older

233
0:7:53,47 --> 0:7:54,71
can you rely on money?

234
0:7:54,71 --> 0:7:56,13
can you rely on power?

235
0:7:56,13 --> 0:7:57,39
without these things

236
0:7:57,39 --> 0:7:59,23
to navigate society

237
0:7:59,23 --> 0:8:0,55
be a bit narcissistic

238
0:8:0,55 --> 0:8:1,78
a bit antisocial

239
0:8:1,78 --> 0:8:3,22
even a bit performative

240
0:8:3,22 --> 0:8:4,94
half-truths are the safest

241
0:8:4,94 --> 0:8:8,0
never feel guilty about your personality flaws

242
0:8:8,0 --> 0:8:9,48
let others be the ones to suffer
