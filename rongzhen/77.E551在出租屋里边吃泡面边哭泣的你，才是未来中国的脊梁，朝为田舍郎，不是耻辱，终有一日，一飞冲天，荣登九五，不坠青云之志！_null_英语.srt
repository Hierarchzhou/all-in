1
0:0:0,42 --> 0:0:3,4
I've noticed that sometimes people don't know how to be grateful.

2
0:0:3,4 --> 0:0:6,23
They don't know who they should be thanking.

3
0:0:6,23 --> 0:0:8,87
And they might even express gratitude to the wrong person.

4
0:0:8,87 --> 0:0:10,96
Look at my life now.

5
0:0:10,96 --> 0:0:15,98
I sleep during the day to avoid the heavy, hot air.

6
0:0:15,98 --> 0:0:17,94
I definitely won't be out there during the morning rush hour,

7
0:0:17,94 --> 0:0:22,26
or the evening rush hour, fighting for a spot on the bus or subway.

8
0:0:22,26 --> 0:0:24,16
Or trying to grab a ride-hailing car.

9
0:0:24,16 --> 0:0:26,48
I just ride my little electric scooter.

10
0:0:26,48 --> 0:0:29,66
Just like Liu Huaqiang, wandering around everywhere

11
0:0:29,66 --> 0:0:33,2
This is truly the start of my retirement life

12
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:35,4
Although I'm 41 years old now

13
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:37,54
But as an old Beijinger

14
0:0:37,54 --> 0:0:39,22
As someone who runs a business

15
0:0:39,22 --> 0:0:41,98
I should understand what I really need to do

16
0:0:41,98 --> 0:0:45,35
What does it mean to understand what you should do?

17
0:0:45,35 --> 0:0:47,25
Speaking of our country

18
0:0:47,25 --> 0:0:50,67
The reason why our country can thrive and prosper now

19
0:0:50,67 --> 0:0:53,45
To support such a large economy

20
0:0:53,45 --> 0:0:55,81
To become a moderately developed country

21
0:0:55,81 --> 0:0:57,58
Let me repeat that

22
0:0:57,58 --> 0:0:59,78
I think at this point

23
0:0:59,78 --> 0:1:2,4
The country is already a moderately developed nation

24
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:4,54
Of course, everyone has different ways of calculating it

25
0:1:4,54 --> 0:1:5,9
That's not the issue

26
0:1:5,9 --> 0:1:11,98
But those young people who are eating takeout in their rented rooms

27
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:14,92
While crying

28
0:1:14,92 --> 0:1:20,77
Those who come to big cities to work, often referred to as small-town test-takers,

29
0:1:20,77 --> 0:1:24,53
were the left-behind children of yesterday,

30
0:1:24,53 --> 0:1:26,81
and they are, how should I put it,

31
0:1:26,81 --> 0:1:28,94
the backbone of China today.

32
0:1:29,22 --> 0:1:30,7
Why do I say that?

33
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:32,36
I've mentioned this multiple times,

34
0:1:32,36 --> 0:1:36,43
there's no such distinction between old and new Beijingers,

35
0:1:36,43 --> 0:1:40,29
you'll find that Mr. Lu Xun said something similar many years ago,

36
0:1:40,29 --> 0:1:41,92
he said it.

37
0:1:42,4 --> 0:1:44,8
Whenever I watch a long-distance race,

38
0:1:44,8 --> 0:1:46,22
I often think this way:

39
0:1:46,22 --> 0:1:48,64
the winners are certainly admirable,

40
0:1:48,64 --> 0:1:51,64
but those who, despite their physical exhaustion,

41
0:1:51,64 --> 0:1:55,16
insist on reaching the finish line are the true pillars of China's future.

42
0:1:55,16 --> 0:1:57,12
It's the flowers and applause

43
0:1:57,12 --> 0:1:58,94
that are usually given to the winners,

44
0:1:58,94 --> 0:2:1,1
while the internet giants

45
0:2:1,1 --> 0:2:2,96
often receive less attention.

46
0:2:2,96 --> 0:2:4,98
Those celebrities

47
0:2:4,98 --> 0:2:5,94
Those stars

48
0:2:5,94 --> 0:2:7,39
Those wealthy people

49
0:2:7,39 --> 0:2:9,63
All the flowers and applause go to them

50
0:2:9,63 --> 0:2:12,89
And they actually can't really empathize with ordinary people

51
0:2:12,89 --> 0:2:15,47
But from my perspective,

52
0:2:15,47 --> 0:2:17,15
Frequently see posts about Jingye online

53
0:2:19,18 --> 0:2:21,18
About how Beijing is so authentic and all that

54
0:2:21,18 --> 0:2:23,9
You'll find there's a lot of humor and satire around these topics

55
0:2:23,9 --> 0:2:25,42
There's a lot of self-deprecating humor

56
0:2:25,42 --> 0:2:26,72
This is Jing Ye

57
0:2:26,72 --> 0:2:27,98
This is Hu Ye

58
0:2:27,98 --> 0:2:28,94
Jing Ye for a quick snack

59
0:2:28,94 --> 0:2:30,32
Hu Ye for a quick snack

60
0:2:30,32 --> 0:2:32,0
What about us, the so-called outsiders

61
0:2:32,0 --> 0:2:33,64
People often make jokes about themselves too

62
0:2:33,64 --> 0:2:35,0
But to be honest

63
0:2:35,0 --> 0:2:37,24
All the people around me who are living in Beijing

64
0:2:37,24 --> 0:2:40,32
And those who have struggled or are still struggling in Beijing

65
0:2:40,32 --> 0:2:43,68
These young people are truly the most adorable

66
0:2:43,68 --> 0:2:46,85
This is absolutely not a joke

67
0:2:46,85 --> 0:2:48,61
Because when you're in a city

68
0:2:48,61 --> 0:2:50,83
Let's talk about the basics

69
0:2:50,83 --> 0:2:52,73
I have four apartments in Beijing

70
0:2:52,73 --> 0:2:54,39
Your place remains unrented

71
0:2:54,39 --> 0:2:56,25
Leaving you with zero income

72
0:2:58,33 --> 0:3:0,89
Is it that no one is renting your place?

73
0:3:0,89 --> 0:3:4,72
Your city doesn't offer many job opportunities.

74
0:3:4,72 --> 0:3:7,1
There isn't a good cost of living.

75
0:3:7,1 --> 0:3:9,18
Young people wouldn't choose it.

76
0:3:9,18 --> 0:3:11,56
Like many times before, to be honest,

77
0:3:11,56 --> 0:3:15,3
A city's service industry needs to be well-developed,

78
0:3:15,3 --> 0:3:16,58
There should be places selling breakfast,

79
0:3:16,58 --> 0:3:17,84
There should be food delivery services,

80
0:3:17,84 --> 0:3:18,78
And package delivery services.

81
0:3:18,78 --> 0:3:21,46
Where do these people come from?

82
0:3:21,46 --> 0:3:23,62
They come from the left-behind children of those days.

83
0:3:23,62 --> 0:3:24,58
From 10 years ago,

84
0:3:24,58 --> 0:3:26,92
20 years ago, when their parents were migrant workers.

85
0:3:26,92 --> 0:3:28,22
We often say,

86
0:3:28,22 --> 0:3:30,64
all the various infrastructure projects that sprang up overnight,

87
0:3:30,64 --> 0:3:33,829
were actually supported by that generation of migrant workers.

88
0:3:33,829 --> 0:3:34,949
But now,

89
0:3:34,949 --> 0:3:37,949
it's the children of those migrant workers who are delivering food these days.

90
0:3:37,949 --> 0:3:39,309
Working in basic service industries

91
0:3:39,309 --> 0:3:42,64
As a junior staff in restaurants, you know

92
0:3:42,64 --> 0:3:44,8
The young girls, they are a generation

93
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:47,42
They were among the best learners of their generation.

94
0:3:47,42 --> 0:3:49,12
became a small-town problem solver

95
0:3:49,12 --> 0:3:50,38
Came to the cities

96
0:3:50,38 --> 0:3:54,6
Whether it's a few hundred dollars for a room in an urban village

97
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:56,2
Or the various places in the city

98
0:3:56,2 --> 0:3:57,66
Including shared or private apartments

99
0:3:57,66 --> 0:3:59,91
You'll find that truly

100
0:3:59,91 --> 0:4:2,93
even those who start working after middle school or high school

101
0:4:2,93 --> 0:4:5,25
or those who graduate from university but can't find a job

102
0:4:5,25 --> 0:4:6,39
or those who do find jobs

103
0:4:6,39 --> 0:4:8,39
and get into smooth-running companies

104
0:4:8,39 --> 0:4:14,31
they are actually the core talents of the city

105
0:4:14,31 --> 0:4:17,819
as the providers, you'll realize that just saying you want to help the people of Beijing

106
0:4:17,819 --> 0:4:18,499
or the people of Shanghai

107
0:4:18,499 --> 0:4:21,819
can you really fill all these numerous job positions in Beijing?

108
0:4:21,819 --> 0:4:22,619
You can't fill the gap

109
0:4:22,619 --> 0:4:23,76
with just you and these people

110
0:4:23,76 --> 0:4:24,94
you're not enough

111
0:4:24,94 --> 0:4:25,46
right?

112
0:4:25,46 --> 0:4:26,72
so your economic scale

113
0:4:26,72 --> 0:4:28,22
will be quite small

114
0:4:28,22 --> 0:4:29,44
and everyone will be short of money

115
0:4:29,44 --> 0:4:33,15
that's why so many people come to live in rental houses

116
0:4:33,15 --> 0:4:34,55
and tell their parents

117
0:4:34,55 --> 0:4:35,7
Honestly

118
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:36,83
We hardly saw each other when we were young

119
0:4:36,83 --> 0:4:38,95
And as we grew older, we only meet once a year

120
0:4:38,95 --> 0:4:40,61
Why do we have the Spring Festival travel rush?

121
0:4:40,61 --> 0:4:42,9
There are so many people

122
0:4:42,9 --> 0:4:45,1
Their parents’ generation contributed to the country’s development

123
0:4:45,1 --> 0:4:46,45
They went to various places

124
0:4:46,45 --> 0:4:47,65
And then came to the cities

125
0:4:47,65 --> 0:4:48,47
To work

126
0:4:48,47 --> 0:4:49,63
Tasting the bitterness again

127
0:4:49,63 --> 0:4:51,51
The child has only tasted this dish twice

128
0:4:51,51 --> 0:4:54,1
So, talking about China's urbanization process

129
0:4:54,1 --> 0:4:56,5
Why has it progressed faster than in other countries

130
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:57,68
Why has it been so steady

131
0:4:57,68 --> 0:4:59,86
Why we have over 600 cities

132
0:4:59,86 --> 0:5:2,33
More than 6,600 counties

133
0:5:2,33 --> 0:5:4,299
All these various counties

134
0:5:4,299 --> 0:5:7,379
It's because these people have been the backbone of the economy

135
0:5:7,379 --> 0:5:9,359
Just the people in your city?

136
0:5:9,359 --> 0:5:11,299
So you should be grateful.

137
0:5:11,299 --> 0:5:16,62
There are so many students coming from all over the country.

138
0:5:16,62 --> 0:5:18,2
From all sorts of counties.

139
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:19,2
With all sorts of experiences.

140
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:20,86
They come to your big city.

141
0:5:20,86 --> 0:5:22,4
They contribute their energy.

142
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:22,96
They dedicate their youth.

143
0:5:22,96 --> 0:5:25,69
All these top 20 major cities

144
0:5:25,69 --> 0:5:27,65
Actually, we all benefit from it.

145
0:5:27,65 --> 0:5:28,39
It’s just a matter of how we put it.

146
0:5:28,39 --> 0:5:30,55
Thanks to these migrant populations.

147
0:5:30,55 --> 0:5:33,15
So, in fact, there’s no such thing as migrant populations.

148
0:5:33,15 --> 0:5:35,56
They are still part of the registered residents.

149
0:5:35,56 --> 0:5:36,82
Many people say 110.

150
0:5:36,82 --> 0:5:37,6
I say 310.

151
0:5:37,6 --> 0:5:39,0
Actually, don’t be so proud.

152
0:5:39,0 --> 0:5:43,4
These things you have are just the legacy of your parents’ status.

153
0:5:43,4 --> 0:5:45,56
Due to our unique household registration system

154
0:5:45,56 --> 0:5:49,23
it's a continuation of yesterday's system into today

155
0:5:49,23 --> 0:5:51,27
But fundamentally speaking

156
0:5:51,27 --> 0:5:53,13
who brings vitality to the city

157
0:5:53,13 --> 0:5:55,35
who supports the city's service industry

158
0:5:55,35 --> 0:5:57,93
who drives the city's economic development

159
0:5:57,93 --> 0:6:0,55
just look at the people in Beijing's Tiantongyuan now

160
0:6:0,55 --> 0:6:2,2
how many are actually from Beijing

161
0:6:2,2 --> 0:6:3,74
Huilongguan community

162
0:6:3,74 --> 0:6:5,44
These major internet companies in Changping

163
0:6:5,44 --> 0:6:6,88
how many of them are actually from Beijing?

164
0:6:6,88 --> 0:6:11,16
We have actually achieved the most effective talent diversion, with the most capable individuals

165
0:6:11,16 --> 0:6:14,18
making significant contributions at the C9 for the country

166
0:6:14,18 --> 0:6:15,92
and contributing to the major internet companies

167
0:6:15,92 --> 0:6:17,4
those programmers, right?

168
0:6:17,4 --> 0:6:20,13
coding all sorts of beautifully crafted apps

169
0:6:20,13 --> 0:6:21,17
that you can use

170
0:6:21,17 --> 0:6:23,9
and enjoy the benefits of the internet

171
0:6:23,9 --> 0:6:25,74
That's all thanks to their hair density.

172
0:6:26,1 --> 0:6:28,42
Those food delivery riders live in various urban villages.

173
0:6:28,42 --> 0:6:31,2
They reside in densely populated residential areas.

174
0:6:31,2 --> 0:6:32,86
What do they provide?

175
0:6:32,86 --> 0:6:35,169
They provide essential urban services.

176
0:6:35,169 --> 0:6:37,49
And there are also the barber Tony guys.

177
0:6:37,49 --> 0:6:38,189
All these people,

178
0:6:38,189 --> 0:6:42,86
They dedicate their most precious years in their twenties to Beijing.

179
0:6:42,86 --> 0:6:43,96
To be honest,

180
0:6:43,96 --> 0:6:45,96
All of you, the original residents of Beijing,

181
0:6:45,96 --> 0:6:48,16
whether you're from the suburbs or the city center,

182
0:6:48,16 --> 0:6:50,63
should be grateful for their contributions.

183
0:6:50,63 --> 0:6:51,99
Thanks to their contributions,

184
0:6:51,99 --> 0:6:53,11
there is the Beijing you have today.

185
0:6:53,11 --> 0:6:55,35
But all you can feel is the traffic congestion,

186
0:6:55,35 --> 0:6:56,35
which is mostly due to people from other regions,

187
0:6:56,35 --> 0:6:57,31
and it's getting harder to find work,

188
0:6:57,31 --> 0:6:58,25
again, mostly due to people from other regions.

189
0:6:58,25 --> 0:7:0,85
So you're competing on a level playing field.

190
0:7:0,85 --> 0:7:1,21
Right?

191
0:7:1,21 --> 0:7:2,13
And besides,

192
0:7:2,13 --> 0:7:4,13
Why shouldn't people come to the capital of China?

193
0:7:4,13 --> 0:7:4,6
Right?

194
0:7:4,6 --> 0:7:5,64
Now it's the holiday season,

195
0:7:5,64 --> 0:7:8,84
and they want more people to come and liven up the tourism market in Beijing.

196
0:7:8,84 --> 0:7:10,84
So it all depends on whose perspective you're looking from.

197
0:7:10,84 --> 0:7:12,64
From the perspective of an ordinary citizen,

198
0:7:12,64 --> 0:7:15,36
You feel like they're encroaching on your personal space

199
0:7:15,36 --> 0:7:18,64
But the reason Beijing has become a megacity today

200
0:7:18,64 --> 0:7:20,64
To have such a vast space for development

201
0:7:20,64 --> 0:7:25,38
Is due to these people, these migrant populations

202
0:7:25,38 --> 0:7:28,909
And these people are not from other countries

203
0:7:28,909 --> 0:7:32,589
They are migrants from other parts of the country

204
0:7:32,589 --> 0:7:33,589
Not legal immigrants

205
0:7:33,589 --> 0:7:34,109
Illegal immigrants

206
0:7:34,109 --> 0:7:35,74
We don't have that many immigrants

207
0:7:35,74 --> 0:7:39,26
These people are our own flesh and blood.

208
0:7:39,26 --> 0:7:41,13
They speak the same language as us.

209
0:7:41,13 --> 0:7:43,83
Fellow countrymen with similar language, culture, and customs.

210
0:7:43,83 --> 0:7:45,45
It's that simple.

211
0:7:45,45 --> 0:7:47,159
They come from different places.

212
0:7:47,159 --> 0:7:51,76
Your city attracting people is what ensures your property values.

213
0:7:51,76 --> 0:7:54,28
The fundamental reason you can collect rent.

214
0:7:54,28 --> 0:7:56,28
You get to enjoy a variety of services.

215
0:7:56,28 --> 0:7:57,669
All of which are made possible by others' sacrifices.

216
0:7:57,669 --> 0:8:0,189
Although you exchange money for these services,

217
0:8:0,189 --> 0:8:1,369
it's important to realize,

218
0:8:1,369 --> 0:8:3,69
if there's no one in your city,

219
0:8:3,69 --> 0:8:5,45
you'll find many cities competing for residents.

220
0:8:5,45 --> 0:8:6,69
if your city lacks people,

221
0:8:6,69 --> 0:8:8,81
labor will become extremely expensive,

222
0:8:8,81 --> 0:8:10,77
and you won't be able to enjoy various services.

223
0:8:10,77 --> 0:8:12,39
you'll be forced to move,

224
0:8:12,39 --> 0:8:13,49
after you move

225
0:8:13,49 --> 0:8:15,5
You'll find that these assets of yours

226
0:8:15,5 --> 0:8:18,1
your properties will gradually become like those in Hegang

227
0:8:18,1 --> 0:8:20,9
you'll realize your house isn't worth much anymore

228
0:8:20,9 --> 0:8:21,57
so by then, you'll be left with nothing

229
0:8:21,57 --> 0:8:22,85
and you'll be forced to relocate

230
0:8:22,85 --> 0:8:25,63
so it's a good thing when people are willing to move to your city

231
0:8:25,63 --> 0:8:26,61
to your hometown

232
0:8:26,61 --> 0:8:27,57
to help develop your hometown

233
0:8:27,57 --> 0:8:30,44
you should feel grateful first

234
0:8:30,44 --> 0:8:33,82
It's really these people who are holding up your country.

235
0:8:33,82 --> 0:8:37,67
The economy of your hometown is being fueled by their youth.

236
0:8:37,67 --> 0:8:39,51
Using this kind of energy as fuel,

237
0:8:39,51 --> 0:8:41,109
they are burning their passion,

238
0:8:41,109 --> 0:8:42,629
providing you with these services.

239
0:8:42,629 --> 0:8:46,61
So every time I get a delivery from an out-of-town courier,

240
0:8:46,61 --> 0:8:47,93
when it comes to these things the delivery guy provides,

241
0:8:47,93 --> 0:8:48,65
if it's hot weather,

242
0:8:48,65 --> 0:8:50,5
I always give them a bottle of drink.

243
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:52,14
This is the bare minimum I can do.

244
0:8:52,14 --> 0:8:55,46
The least I can do is not to give others bad reviews.

245
0:8:55,46 --> 0:8:57,76
But you'll find that many people are like this.

246
0:8:57,76 --> 0:9:0,2
I'm in this city.

247
0:9:0,2 --> 0:9:1,8
I'm a white-collar worker.

248
0:9:1,8 --> 0:9:3,42
So I take advantage of those who work with their hands.

249
0:9:3,42 --> 0:9:4,44
I'm a security guard.

250
0:9:4,44 --> 0:9:6,4
They say I bully food delivery people.

251
0:9:6,4 --> 0:9:7,39
So that's how it is.

252
0:9:7,39 --> 0:9:9,63
You'll find that those who truly bully others

253
0:9:9,63 --> 0:9:14,5
It's the struggle for living space among the poor.

254
0:9:14,5 --> 0:9:18,44
So, if you have this kind of regional prejudice

255
0:9:18,44 --> 0:9:22,25
it shows that your quality of life is relatively low

256
0:9:22,25 --> 0:9:24,99
So you might feel that others are encroaching on your space

257
0:9:24,99 --> 0:9:27,36
while your income isn't high

258
0:9:27,36 --> 0:9:29,16
and your job performance isn't great

259
0:9:29,16 --> 0:9:30,65
that's why you feel

260
0:9:30,65 --> 0:9:32,51
you know, you drive a car

261
0:9:32,51 --> 0:9:36,3
So I'm already semi-financially independent in my daily life.

262
0:9:36,3 --> 0:9:37,73
Who would care about my affairs?

263
0:9:37,73 --> 0:9:38,19
Right?

264
0:9:38,19 --> 0:9:39,33
No one will stand in my way

265
0:9:39,33 --> 0:9:40,59
Others provide services for me.

266
0:9:40,59 --> 0:9:42,69
I should be grateful to them.

267
0:9:42,69 --> 0:9:43,909
If your status is lower,

268
0:9:43,909 --> 0:9:47,28
You'll have to compete with others for survival space.

269
0:9:47,28 --> 0:9:49,88
That's why some people have regional prejudices.

270
0:9:49,88 --> 0:9:52,98
It's because his social status is relatively low

271
0:9:52,98 --> 0:9:54,99
His income level is relatively low

272
0:9:54,99 --> 0:9:59,67
So he ends up competing with those who have just moved to the city

273
0:9:59,67 --> 0:10:2,109
For these people

274
0:10:2,109 --> 0:10:5,469
Among my classmates, those who are the most regionally prejudiced

275
0:10:5,469 --> 0:10:7,149
And strongly emphasize their Beijing identity

276
0:10:7,149 --> 0:10:9,51
Without exception, are those with lower incomes

277
0:10:9,51 --> 0:10:11,29
They are all at a lower rank

278
0:10:11,29 --> 0:10:12,17
Holding lower positions

279
0:10:12,17 --> 0:10:14,59
So he genuinely developed conflicts with these people

280
0:10:14,59 --> 0:10:16,3
in real life

281
0:10:16,3 --> 0:10:18,46
which is why he harbors such deep resentment

282
0:10:18,46 --> 0:10:19,94
and such strong prejudice

283
0:10:19,94 --> 0:10:23,12
and emphasizes his identity as a Beijinger so much

284
0:10:23,12 --> 0:10:26,62
This is because he has truly experienced friction in the competition

285
0:10:26,62 --> 0:10:28,68
Only those who ride the subway

286
0:10:28,68 --> 0:10:31,8
would feel that there are so many people from other regions coming now

287
0:10:31,8 --> 0:10:33,52
During the Spring Festival, it finally feels a bit less crowded

288
0:10:33,52 --> 0:10:34,8
A bit more spacious

289
0:10:34,8 --> 0:10:36,46
Since you take the bus or subway every day

290
0:10:36,46 --> 0:10:37,88
It’s that simple

291
0:10:37,88 --> 0:10:40,46
You have been genuinely squeezed out of your living space.

292
0:10:40,46 --> 0:10:44,11
These spaces were originally meant for you to do other things

293
0:10:44,11 --> 0:10:44,59
Right?

294
0:10:44,59 --> 0:10:46,89
So, let’s talk about it

295
0:10:46,89 --> 0:10:48,289
If your assets are well allocated

296
0:10:48,289 --> 0:10:51,49
If your family knows how to handle you

297
0:10:51,49 --> 0:10:52,409
How should we work together?

298
0:10:52,409 --> 0:10:53,51
Regarding the future path,

299
0:10:53,51 --> 0:10:56,25
You won't spend too much time in a basic space.

300
0:10:56,25 --> 0:10:59,47
which is why many second-generation city dwellers are so anxious.

301
0:10:59,47 --> 0:11:1,95
Poor performance by the next generation can lead to a decline in social status,

302
0:11:1,95 --> 0:11:3,194
that's the reason behind it.

303
0:11:3,23 --> 0:11:6,35
So, if your social standing is higher,

304
0:11:6,35 --> 0:11:7,25
the higher you stand,

305
0:11:7,25 --> 0:11:7,95
the farther you can see.

306
0:11:7,95 --> 0:11:9,15
You'll come to understand

307
0:11:9,15 --> 0:11:11,53
that conflicts between people aren't as common as you might think

308
0:11:11,53 --> 0:11:13,45
but the lower your social status

309
0:11:13,45 --> 0:11:14,49
the lower your level

310
0:11:14,49 --> 0:11:16,53
in a very low position

311
0:11:16,53 --> 0:11:18,37
struggling for limited survival resources with others

312
0:11:18,37 --> 0:11:20,79
that's when competition arises

313
0:11:20,79 --> 0:11:21,759
that's when discrimination occurs

314
0:11:21,759 --> 0:11:22,359
and there's opposition

315
0:11:22,359 --> 0:11:23,939
It's just that simple.

316
0:11:23,939 --> 0:11:26,3
So, it's your heart that isn't broad enough.

317
0:11:26,3 --> 0:11:27,49
It's your level that's too low.

318
0:11:27,49 --> 0:11:28,99
That's why you have prejudices against others.

319
0:11:28,99 --> 0:11:30,43
That's why you discriminate against others.

320
0:11:30,43 --> 0:11:31,62
It's just that simple.

321
0:11:31,62 --> 0:11:33,5
So, it's really like those rednecks in America,

322
0:11:33,5 --> 0:11:37,48
those lower-class white Americans who feel so whatnot,

323
0:11:37,48 --> 0:11:39,24
those upper-class white Americans,

324
0:11:39,24 --> 0:11:39,76
those elites,

325
0:11:39,76 --> 0:11:40,6
do they feel it?

326
0:11:40,6 --> 0:11:41,72
They don't feel it.

327
0:11:41,72 --> 0:11:42,75
So, that's how it is.

328
0:11:42,75 --> 0:11:44,849
This is the truth of society.

329
0:11:44,849 --> 0:11:47,529
So, whether we talk about regional discrimination or not,

330
0:11:47,529 --> 0:11:48,289
or anything else,

331
0:11:48,289 --> 0:11:51,369
it all stems from your social status not being high enough.

332
0:11:51,369 --> 0:11:55,17
That's why you feel this kind of pressure to survive.

333
0:11:55,17 --> 0:11:57,67
Outsiders sense these things from you.

334
0:11:57,67 --> 0:12:0,829
So, we say, who is the most valuable today?

335
0:12:0,829 --> 0:12:2,109
Who is the most valuable?

336
0:12:2,109 --> 0:12:5,53
Those who dedicate their youth to a city are the most valuable.

337
0:12:5,53 --> 0:12:8,19
This is also a city's greatest appeal.

338
0:12:8,19 --> 0:12:10,46
So, when it comes to it,

339
0:12:10,46 --> 0:12:11,94
from the perspective of propaganda,

340
0:12:11,94 --> 0:12:14,6
we should try to promote this idea,

341
0:12:14,6 --> 0:12:16,62
to eliminate the differences between regions,

342
0:12:16,62 --> 0:12:18,8
everyone, like the people of Beijing,

343
0:12:18,8 --> 0:12:20,9
everyone's ancestors came from all over the country,

344
0:12:20,9 --> 0:12:23,94
it's just that you arrived a few decades earlier,

345
0:12:23,94 --> 0:12:25,46
there's no such thing as a special status,

346
0:12:27,58 --> 0:12:29,56
and it hasn't existed up to today anyway.

347
0:12:29,56 --> 0:12:30,7
So, we say,

348
0:12:30,7 --> 0:12:33,6
these are the things we want to convey today,

349
0:12:34,6 --> 0:12:36,48
whoever contributes their youth to a city,

350
0:12:36,48 --> 0:12:38,74
is the greatest person in that city.
