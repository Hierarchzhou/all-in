1
0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:0,44
Hello everyone!

2
0:0:0,44 --> 0:0:1,34
I'm Lao Jiang.

3
0:0:1,34 --> 0:0:3,62
Life has been quite eventful lately.

4
0:0:3,62 --> 0:0:4,36
I've been participating in debates,

5
0:0:4,36 --> 0:0:5,16
and running a tavern,

6
0:0:5,16 --> 0:0:7,96
with several projects to push forward in both life and work.

7
0:0:7,96 --> 0:0:8,88
It's been a bit overwhelming,

8
0:0:8,88 --> 0:0:9,66
hard to keep up with everything.

9
0:0:9,66 --> 0:0:11,4
Just in time, Quark reached out to me,

10
0:0:11,4 --> 0:0:14,28
to do a review of their AI Super Box.

11
0:0:14,28 --> 0:0:15,64
So, I'll be a bit more practical.

12
0:0:15,64 --> 0:0:18,8
I might as well connect it with a few real-life tasks I need to handle recently.

13
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:20,8
to see how much it can actually help me solve this issue.

14
0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:22,88
So, what’s the latest feature update from Quark?

15
0:0:22,88 --> 0:0:24,68
It’s called Deep Search.

16
0:0:24,68 --> 0:0:26,3
The design concept behind this feature is quite interesting.

17
0:0:26,3 --> 0:0:28,85
Search isn’t new to AI anymore.

18
0:0:28,85 --> 0:0:32,13
I’ve been using AI search for about a year now.

19
0:0:32,13 --> 0:0:34,94
So, how does Quark’s Deep Search actually perform in use?

20
0:0:37,42 --> 0:0:39,62
The experience really highlights distinct differences.

21
0:0:39,62 --> 0:0:40,78
In my view,

22
0:0:40,78 --> 0:0:43,2
Quark’s deep search is a combination of an agent and search functionality,

23
0:0:43,2 --> 0:0:45,3
integrated with deep thinking.

24
0:0:45,3 --> 0:0:49,23
When you ask Quark’s AI deep search a question,

25
0:0:49,23 --> 0:0:50,43
it follows a three-step process.

26
0:0:50,43 --> 0:0:53,17
The first step is to determine what you need to search for.

27
0:0:53,17 --> 0:0:54,5
In this step,

28
0:0:54,5 --> 0:0:56,5
Quark breaks down the problem much like a real exam question,

29
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:57,45
analyzing your actual needs.

30
0:0:57,45 --> 0:0:59,73
It involves judging your search intent

31
0:0:59,73 --> 0:1:2,9
Breaking down the question into several specific search points

32
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:4,989
I personally think this step is very human-like

33
0:1:4,989 --> 0:1:6,149
I've always felt that

34
0:1:6,149 --> 0:1:8,809
I've also made a video before about how to conduct research.

35
0:1:8,809 --> 0:1:9,989
I've deeply pondered this issue

36
0:1:9,989 --> 0:1:13,17
I've always believed the hardest part of research

37
0:1:13,17 --> 0:1:15,53
May not be the specific search phase

38
0:1:15,53 --> 0:1:18,4
Nor is it necessarily the final phase of organizing and summarizing to form insights

39
0:1:18,4 --> 0:1:22,24
The most crucial initial step is how to formulate a good question

40
0:1:22,24 --> 0:1:23,38
If you bring it up

41
0:1:23,38 --> 0:1:25,47
the research is already halfway to success

42
0:1:25,47 --> 0:1:27,27
but the paradox lies in where

43
0:1:27,27 --> 0:1:29,43
many good questions in specialized fields

44
0:1:29,43 --> 0:1:31,59
require a certain amount of information to be raised

45
0:1:31,59 --> 0:1:33,31
but before you start searching

46
0:1:33,31 --> 0:1:34,44
that information doesn't exist

47
0:1:34,44 --> 0:1:35,96
so this leads to the research

48
0:1:35,96 --> 0:1:38,58
the initial stage of searching being relatively challenging

49
0:1:38,58 --> 0:1:39,72
especially for newcomers

50
0:1:39,72 --> 0:1:41,82
For those who are relatively inexperienced in conducting surveys

51
0:1:41,82 --> 0:1:44,14
This is also one of the main reasons

52
0:1:44,14 --> 0:1:45,37
that makes in-depth research quite challenging

53
0:1:45,37 --> 0:1:48,65
Quark’s innovative approach of breaking down vague questions into

54
0:1:48,65 --> 0:1:51,75
specific and detailed sub-questions for in-depth searches

55
0:1:51,75 --> 0:1:54,51
can significantly reduce the difficulty for ordinary people to conduct research

56
0:1:54,51 --> 0:1:56,31
essentially simplifying the most challenging part for you

57
0:1:56,31 --> 0:1:59,23
This step also sets Quark apart from other deep thinking

58
0:1:59,23 --> 0:2:0,69
models in a significant way

59
0:2:0,69 --> 0:2:2,67
making Quark’s search function more effective

60
0:2:2,67 --> 0:2:4,16
The planning aspect is noticeably better.

61
0:2:4,16 --> 0:2:6,44
The second step is how to search and where to search.

62
0:2:6,44 --> 0:2:9,12
This step's foundation is similar to other AI tools.

63
0:2:9,12 --> 0:2:10,54
But there are two differences.

64
0:2:10,54 --> 0:2:11,6
The first one is that

65
0:2:11,6 --> 0:2:13,58
Quark relies on high-quality sources from Alibaba.

66
0:2:13,58 --> 0:2:15,44
This is a prerequisite for AI to provide reliable answers.

67
0:2:15,44 --> 0:2:19,14
It can reduce the high hallucination rate of large models at the source.

68
0:2:19,14 --> 0:2:20,28
I've mentioned in my previous videos

69
0:2:20,28 --> 0:2:21,4
the high hallucination rate.

70
0:2:21,4 --> 0:2:24,27
Actually, it hinders the current large models from becoming more practical.

71
0:2:24,27 --> 0:2:25,79
It's a significant obstacle.

72
0:2:25,79 --> 0:2:27,2
It can resolve part of the issue.

73
0:2:27,2 --> 0:2:29,74
This point is crucial in many areas involving health, finance, and other critical aspects of life.

74
0:2:29,74 --> 0:2:33,4
Only with a low hallucination rate can you trust it.

75
0:2:33,4 --> 0:2:34,74
It’s reliable.

76
0:2:34,74 --> 0:2:35,32
You’d dare to use it, right?

77
0:2:35,32 --> 0:2:36,74
Another difference is that Quark doesn’t just perform searches in a rigid manner.

78
0:2:36,74 --> 0:2:39,98
Instead, it’s based on Alibaba’s self-developed large model.

79
0:2:41,88 --> 0:2:44,93
Adjust the search content dynamically based on analytical reasoning

80
0:2:44,93 --> 0:2:47,4
This is actually quite similar to how humans think.

81
0:2:47,4 --> 0:2:49,2
We do indeed search while

82
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:51,96
adjusting our search logic based on further information.

83
0:2:51,96 --> 0:2:53,7
It's quite flexible.

84
0:2:53,7 --> 0:2:54,67
The third step is deep thinking.

85
0:2:54,67 --> 0:2:56,67
Which involves reasoning and fitting based on the search content.

86
0:2:56,67 --> 0:2:58,19
Ultimately generating an answer.

87
0:2:58,19 --> 0:3:1,67
The advantages of deep thinking have been experienced by many people.

88
0:3:1,67 --> 0:3:2,83
I wonder if you've had this experience.

89
0:3:2,83 --> 0:3:5,3
Apart from improving search quality,

90
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:9,15
it also allows users to see the AI’s thought process,

91
0:3:9,15 --> 0:3:11,3
which helps better understand the issues.

92
0:3:11,3 --> 0:3:12,33
My experience is

93
0:3:12,33 --> 0:3:17,489
sometimes you can even discover some underlying intentions in your questions

94
0:3:17,489 --> 0:3:17,689
by

95
0:3:17,689 --> 0:3:20,729
examining the AI’s deep thinking process,

96
0:3:20,729 --> 0:3:22,8
intentions that even you didn’t realize you had.

97
0:3:22,8 --> 0:3:24,84
I didn’t know my questions had this underlying meaning,

98
0:3:24,84 --> 0:3:26,12
but the AI picked it up.

99
0:3:26,12 --> 0:3:27,51
This is indeed the case.

100
0:3:27,51 --> 0:3:28,71
So, after comprehensive testing,

101
0:3:28,71 --> 0:3:30,41
this methodology involves multiple mechanisms and processes,

102
0:3:30,41 --> 0:3:32,59
while also being reliable in sourcing information,

103
0:3:32,59 --> 0:3:33,21
it ranks absolutely first,

104
0:3:33,21 --> 0:3:35,28
and the results align closely with user needs.

105
0:3:35,28 --> 0:3:37,8
It can conduct very specific information searches,

106
0:3:37,8 --> 0:3:39,8
as well as handle some rather vague,

107
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:41,17
and more complex daily life issues.

108
0:3:41,17 --> 0:3:43,61
Now, I'll proceed to test a few scenarios.

109
0:3:43,61 --> 0:3:46,3
These are all based on my actual living needs recently.

110
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:49,46
The first scenario was a few days ago when I participated in a debate in Guangzhou.

111
0:3:49,46 --> 0:3:52,2
One of the topics I debated was about abstract culture.

112
0:3:52,2 --> 0:3:53,87
Whether it is a poison or an antidote for the youth.

113
0:3:53,87 --> 0:3:55,59
Our side argued that it is an antidote.

114
0:3:55,59 --> 0:3:57,78
I wanted to see if Quark could help with the preparation.

115
0:3:57,78 --> 0:3:59,72
First, I asked him to break down the topic.

116
0:3:59,72 --> 0:4:1,6
To see if there could be some inspiration in terms of approach.

117
0:4:1,6 --> 0:4:3,35
After asking Quark this question,

118
0:4:3,35 --> 0:4:5,73
We saw that Quark took the first step.

119
0:4:5,73 --> 0:4:6,79
He didn't start with a search.

120
0:4:6,79 --> 0:4:10,5
Instead, he thought about the problem before searching.

121
0:4:10,5 --> 0:4:13,58
He assessed the purpose of my search for this question.

122
0:4:13,58 --> 0:4:15,32
Then he broke it down into several sub-questions.

123
0:4:15,32 --> 0:4:16,86
For instance, in this question,

124
0:4:16,86 --> 0:4:18,64
Kuake thought through it and

125
0:4:18,64 --> 0:4:22,869
This broke down one of my major issues into five perspectives.

126
0:4:22,869 --> 0:4:24,69
The first perspective,

127
0:4:24,69 --> 0:4:25,98
for example, is the abstraction of culture,

128
0:4:25,98 --> 0:4:28,36
the pathway of change from subculture to mainstream culture

129
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:32,12
The second one is to look into the psychological mechanisms of humor.

130
0:4:32,12 --> 0:4:33,58
And the neuroscientific basis as well.

131
0:4:33,58 --> 0:4:36,46
Then, investigate how teenagers use this abstract culture.

132
0:4:36,46 --> 0:4:38,44
For identity construction, looking at research cases.

133
0:4:38,44 --> 0:4:41,58
Also, gather some social case studies.

134
0:4:41,58 --> 0:4:44,1
Including exploring postmodern culture.

135
0:4:44,1 --> 0:4:45,7
I think these perspectives are quite good.

136
0:4:45,7 --> 0:4:48,58
Some of them are even something I haven’t fully grasped.

137
0:4:48,58 --> 0:4:49,78
I didn’t think of them at the very beginning.

138
0:4:49,78 --> 0:4:51,6
So moving forward, as I mentioned,

139
0:4:51,6 --> 0:4:53,8
He embarked on a genuine search.

140
0:4:53,8 --> 0:4:54,51
Some of the web pages he searched.

141
0:4:54,51 --> 0:4:56,9
Then, with his previous thoughts in mind.

142
0:4:56,9 --> 0:4:58,47
These searches were also quite targeted.

143
0:4:58,47 --> 0:5:0,45
Finally, he presented some results.

144
0:5:0,45 --> 0:5:1,3
First of all,

145
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:4,21
I see this as the origin and development trajectory of abstract culture.

146
0:5:4,21 --> 0:5:6,34
This part I found a bit challenging to grasp.

147
0:5:6,34 --> 0:5:9,56
Because seeing someone like Yao Shui Ge and Chen Yi being so serious,

148
0:5:9,56 --> 0:5:11,28
When they appear in the answers.

149
0:5:11,28 --> 0:5:12,86
I feel there's something quite intriguing about it.

150
0:5:12,86 --> 0:5:14,2
So, I'll get straight to the point.

151
0:5:14,2 --> 0:5:16,24
I'll talk about the standout points among these.

152
0:5:16,24 --> 0:5:19,7
For instance, in the breakdown of the debate topic and the theoretical framework,

153
0:5:19,7 --> 0:5:20,23
I think they stand out quite a bit.

154
0:5:20,23 --> 0:5:23,33
He talks about the solution, which is our actual stance,

155
0:5:23,33 --> 0:5:25,11
What could be the core arguments?

156
0:5:25,11 --> 0:5:26,909
One is the humorous stress-relief function,

157
0:5:26,909 --> 0:5:28,389
This was played out in the debate.

158
0:5:28,389 --> 0:5:31,389
Another is building a resilient social ecosystem.

159
0:5:31,389 --> 0:5:32,189
There wasn't a direct hit

160
0:5:32,189 --> 0:5:33,12
but it was mentioned

161
0:5:33,12 --> 0:5:36,4
And it represents a postmodern resistance and reconstruction

162
0:5:36,4 --> 0:5:39,27
This point was also truly brought up on the field

163
0:5:39,27 --> 0:5:42,3
He pointed out that the opposing side's point about this toxic abstract culture

164
0:5:42,3 --> 0:5:42,79
The side arguing for the toxic element

165
0:5:42,79 --> 0:5:44,94
He suggested that the opposition might say

166
0:5:44,94 --> 0:5:46,96
This abstract culture is not the antidote

167
0:5:46,96 --> 0:5:48,38
But rather a numbing agent

168
0:5:48,38 --> 0:5:51,74
What we actually put forward on the field was

169
0:5:51,74 --> 0:5:53,26
I remember the side of Chen Ming and Luo Miao

170
0:5:53,26 --> 0:5:55,38
They said abstract culture is a drug

171
0:5:55,38 --> 0:5:56,5
not a cure

172
0:5:56,5 --> 0:5:57,28
That's the point

173
0:5:57,28 --> 0:5:59,34
Also, this abstract culture

174
0:5:59,34 --> 0:6:1,7
leads to the dilution of entertainment and values

175
0:6:1,7 --> 0:6:3,56
as well as generational conflicts and cultural fragmentation

176
0:6:3,56 --> 0:6:6,72
Then he went on to predict some battlefields of attack and defense

177
0:6:6,72 --> 0:6:10,82
including suggestions for the opposition's preparation strategies and so on

178
0:6:10,82 --> 0:6:12,14
a series of answers

179
0:6:12,14 --> 0:6:15,8
I think this answer is quite useful for reference.

180
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:16,18
So after the test,

181
0:6:16,18 --> 0:6:19,28
I believe this question can provide some assistance.

182
0:6:19,28 --> 0:6:21,72
Additionally, in the debate, there will certainly be a focus on this.

183
0:6:21,72 --> 0:6:22,46
covert defense and offense.

184
0:6:22,46 --> 0:6:25,56
For instance, our side argues that abstract culture can bring joy.

185
0:6:25,56 --> 0:6:26,88
Since we consider it a remedy,

186
0:6:26,88 --> 0:6:29,2
we will certainly provide examples that bring immediate happiness.

187
0:6:29,2 --> 0:6:30,6
Positive and uplifting content,

188
0:6:30,6 --> 0:6:32,2
examples of such abstract culture.

189
0:6:32,2 --> 0:6:35,44
But the other side will definitely mention the particularly repugnant aspects of abstract culture

190
0:6:35,44 --> 0:6:36,14
The disgusting ones

191
0:6:36,14 --> 0:6:38,4
Those that violate public morals and good customs

192
0:6:38,4 --> 0:6:39,28
On this issue

193
0:6:39,28 --> 0:6:41,57
I also need Qu to help me search for some cases

194
0:6:41,57 --> 0:6:42,33
Gather a few

195
0:6:42,33 --> 0:6:45,55
Examples that might assist us in our arguments on the field

196
0:6:45,55 --> 0:6:47,55
Qu still follows the three-step approach

197
0:6:47,55 --> 0:6:48,31
As you can see

198
0:6:48,31 --> 0:6:49,23
This problem breakdown

199
0:6:49,23 --> 0:6:49,75
Then search

200
0:6:49,75 --> 0:6:51,19
Then engage in deep thinking

201
0:6:51,19 --> 0:6:52,669
Finally, give me an answer

202
0:6:52,669 --> 0:6:54,909
So, to cut a long story short in this answer

203
0:6:54,909 --> 0:6:56,429
I think there are at least two things

204
0:6:56,429 --> 0:6:58,469
that we can truly put to use

205
0:6:58,469 --> 0:7:3,49
One is that a platform turned the abstract into a selected term last year

206
0:7:3,49 --> 0:7:5,31
as its platform's annual keyword

207
0:7:5,31 --> 0:7:6,57
This point is useful for us

208
0:7:6,57 --> 0:7:8,16
We indeed applied it to some extent in the field

209
0:7:8,16 --> 0:7:9,8
Another point is

210
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:10,92
to view the chaotic behavior of young people

211
0:7:10,92 --> 0:7:13,56
as a form of deconstruction and rebellion

212
0:7:13,56 --> 0:7:15,88
which is also a more positive example

213
0:7:15,88 --> 0:7:19,799
This is about how it's used in a debate setting

214
0:7:19,799 --> 0:7:22,599
Though this is a bit of hindsight, right?

215
0:7:22,599 --> 0:7:24,539
We didn't have Quark when we were debating

216
0:7:24,539 --> 0:7:27,41
But looking back, it’s worth evaluating

217
0:7:27,41 --> 0:7:29,79
what Quark provided is still useful

218
0:7:29,79 --> 0:7:31,59
So what is the second life scenario?

219
0:7:31,59 --> 0:7:32,45
It's a pet

220
0:7:32,45 --> 0:7:34,5
I have a Maine Coon cat

221
0:7:34,5 --> 0:7:34,93
I've had it for many years

222
0:7:34,93 --> 0:7:35,95
His name is Guai

223
0:7:35,95 --> 0:7:37,13
He is four years old now

224
0:7:37,13 --> 0:7:38,33
I can show everyone

225
0:7:38,33 --> 0:7:39,29
Super duper handsome

226
0:7:40,57 --> 0:7:44,34
Oh, we've brought our naughty one over

227
0:7:44,34 --> 0:7:46,28
Guai is really handsome

228
0:7:46,28 --> 0:7:49,94
Maine Coons are the largest domestic cats in the world

229
0:7:49,94 --> 0:7:51,5
But our cat

230
0:7:51,5 --> 0:7:54,28
Our cat has been eating raw meat and bones since it was a kitten

231
0:7:54,28 --> 0:7:55,38
Especially vigorous

232
0:7:55,38 --> 0:7:57,3
It weighs about 22 pounds

233
0:7:57,3 --> 0:7:59,8
I think that's a bit exaggerated

234
0:7:59,8 --> 0:8:1,72
I know Maine Coons are quite large

235
0:8:1,72 --> 0:8:3,76
But I didn't realize

236
0:8:3,76 --> 0:8:6,56
If this weight is overweight

237
0:8:6,56 --> 0:8:8,46
And whether it needs to lose weight

238
0:8:8,46 --> 0:8:9,54
Regarding this issue

239
0:8:9,54 --> 0:8:10,62
Let's ask Quark

240
0:8:10,62 --> 0:8:11,7
He seems a bit upset

241
0:8:11,7 --> 0:8:12,58
Because he was sleeping just now

242
0:8:12,58 --> 0:8:14,79
And I dragged him over

243
0:8:17,52 --> 0:8:19,72
Uh-huh

244
0:8:19,72 --> 0:8:21,7
It's good to let it go

245
0:8:21,7 --> 0:8:22,6
Regarding this issue

246
0:8:22,6 --> 0:8:24,19
He'll start by thinking it through

247
0:8:24,19 --> 0:8:25,79
And everyone is already quite familiar with it

248
0:8:25,79 --> 0:8:26,23
A three-step approach

249
0:8:26,23 --> 0:8:27,1
Then proceed with the search.

250
0:8:27,1 --> 0:8:28,69
Then dive into a deep search, right?

251
0:8:28,69 --> 0:8:30,25
The answer he gave was quite subtle.

252
0:8:30,25 --> 0:8:32,56
It's about the size of an adult male cat.

253
0:8:32,56 --> 0:8:35,32
Their weight typically ranges from 12 to 25 pounds.

254
0:8:35,32 --> 0:8:37,26
But ours weighs 22 pounds.

255
0:8:37,26 --> 0:8:40,46
He said it's at the upper end of the normal range for male cats.

256
0:8:40,46 --> 0:8:42,3
So while it's a bit heavy,

257
0:8:42,3 --> 0:8:44,43
it's not necessarily abnormal.

258
0:8:44,43 --> 0:8:47,1
So he suggested I get some tests done.

259
0:8:47,1 --> 0:8:48,43
Using a scientific approach

260
0:8:48,43 --> 0:8:51,79
which is to see if you can clearly feel the ribs

261
0:8:51,79 --> 0:8:53,63
whether there's no excess fat in the abdomen

262
0:8:53,63 --> 0:8:54,93
and if the waistline is well-defined

263
0:8:54,93 --> 0:8:56,39
So after my testing

264
0:8:56,39 --> 0:8:57,53
I felt it all over

265
0:8:57,53 --> 0:8:59,41
and I could feel the ribs

266
0:8:59,41 --> 0:9:0,53
quite easily

267
0:9:0,53 --> 0:9:2,59
but there is excess fat in the abdomen

268
0:9:2,59 --> 0:9:4,45
and a bit of sagging

269
0:9:4,45 --> 0:9:7,92
So I think it might be slightly overweight

270
0:9:7,92 --> 0:9:9,56
but close to the normal range

271
0:9:9,56 --> 0:9:12,42
and he also gave a body condition score

272
0:9:12,42 --> 0:9:13,56
which is BCS

273
0:9:13,56 --> 0:9:16,34
If time permits, I would follow up with Quark

274
0:9:16,34 --> 0:9:18,61
to ask what exactly this BCS is

275
0:9:18,61 --> 0:9:20,65
and how I can learn about it

276
0:9:20,65 --> 0:9:21,81
But that's all for this demo video

277
0:9:21,81 --> 0:9:24,0
But that's all for our demonstration video.

278
0:9:25,88 --> 0:9:27,76
Including the choice of your cat's food

279
0:9:27,76 --> 0:9:30,5
And how to enhance its exercise on a daily basis

280
0:9:30,5 --> 0:9:32,11
The management of exercise

281
0:9:32,11 --> 0:9:35,3
Also provided some suggestions for monitoring and adjustments

282
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:36,29
Finally, a summary was given

283
0:9:36,29 --> 0:9:38,94
I think it's quite useful

284
0:9:38,94 --> 0:9:44,9
Going forward, I might indeed encourage Guai Guai a bit more

285
0:9:44,9 --> 0:9:46,66
For instance, slightly controlling its diet

286
0:9:46,66 --> 0:9:49,68
Because eating raw meat from a young age has indeed made its frame a bit larger

287
0:9:49,68 --> 0:9:52,14
And more importantly, ensuring it gets more exercise every day

288
0:9:52,14 --> 0:9:53,16
It just lies there every day.

289
0:9:53,16 --> 0:9:55,8
Spending the whole day doing that.

290
0:9:55,8 --> 0:9:57,96
Actually, it's not very healthy.

291
0:9:57,96 --> 0:9:59,7
There's another question about cats.

292
0:9:59,7 --> 0:10:2,73
Maine Coons, this breed of cat, are quite brave.

293
0:10:2,73 --> 0:10:4,51
And they are relatively more adaptable.

294
0:10:4,51 --> 0:10:5,77
Able to adjust to the external environment.

295
0:10:5,77 --> 0:10:8,57
So it's possible to train a domestic Maine Coon to go out and play.

296
0:10:8,57 --> 0:10:9,57
There's a good chance of success.

297
0:10:9,57 --> 0:10:11,37
I really envy those who can take their cats for walks.

298
0:10:11,37 --> 0:10:14,75
But the amount of training for our pet from a young age wasn't enough.

299
0:10:14,75 --> 0:10:16,38
When we take it out, it gets scared.

300
0:10:16,38 --> 0:10:17,86
Sometimes it even shows mild signs of stress.

301
0:10:17,86 --> 0:10:19,22
So I asked Quark.

302
0:10:19,22 --> 0:10:21,4
Let's see what kind of answer Quark can provide.

303
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:23,78
Now let's look at the agent's section.

304
0:10:23,78 --> 0:10:24,82
In the first step,

305
0:10:24,82 --> 0:10:25,98
it accurately identified

306
0:10:25,98 --> 0:10:28,32
that this is a practical issue related to socialization training.

307
0:10:28,32 --> 0:10:29,18
Then it proceeded with the search.

308
0:10:29,18 --> 0:10:30,1
Engage in deep thinking

309
0:10:30,1 --> 0:10:32,36
So, what did he come up with?

310
0:10:32,36 --> 0:10:36,19
First, he taught me how to interpret the behavior patterns of our cat

311
0:10:36,19 --> 0:10:39,45
When it goes outside

312
0:10:39,45 --> 0:10:40,97
Show me how to understand

313
0:10:40,97 --> 0:10:43,5
If there are any underlying issues with its behavior

314
0:10:43,5 --> 0:10:45,35
Then he provided a scientific training plan

315
0:10:45,35 --> 0:10:46,49
It covers a lot of aspects

316
0:10:46,49 --> 0:10:48,29
Including sound desensitization

317
0:10:48,29 --> 0:10:50,26
And tactile adaptation, among others

318
0:10:50,26 --> 0:10:51,86
It's divided into several stages

319
0:10:51,86 --> 0:10:54,2
It's roughly divided into four stages

320
0:10:54,2 --> 0:10:55,86
Then proceed gradually with desensitization

321
0:10:55,86 --> 0:10:57,119
To carry out speaking practice

322
0:10:57,119 --> 0:10:59,179
He also provided some key points to note

323
0:10:59,179 --> 0:11:0,56
And an alternative option

324
0:11:0,56 --> 0:11:3,0
Well, Shanghai is about to enter summer

325
0:11:3,0 --> 0:11:4,96
Which is a good time to take your cat out

326
0:11:4,96 --> 0:11:7,2
It's a season with relatively warm weather

327
0:11:7,2 --> 0:11:9,22
I might follow this method and see how it goes

328
0:11:9,22 --> 0:11:11,58
Can we add both summer and fall to the plan?

329
0:11:11,58 --> 0:11:14,66
to groom our little one into someone others will envy,

330
0:11:14,66 --> 0:11:15,86
someone we can proudly take out for a walk,

331
0:11:15,86 --> 0:11:17,82
and it would be in a content and relaxed state,

332
0:11:17,82 --> 0:11:19,54
I think life would be much more enjoyable.

333
0:11:19,54 --> 0:11:22,37
And it would also bring a lot more joy to it itself.

334
0:11:22,37 --> 0:11:25,9
The third search scenario is health-related.

335
0:11:25,9 --> 0:11:26,5
This is a real situation,

336
0:11:26,5 --> 0:11:27,5
I'm completely serious about this,

337
0:11:27,5 --> 0:11:28,49
I wouldn't joke about something like this.

338
0:11:28,49 --> 0:11:31,43
It was a condition my mom was diagnosed with towards the end of last year.

339
0:11:31,43 --> 0:11:33,37
It's called macular degeneration.

340
0:11:33,37 --> 0:11:35,11
This condition is not life-threatening at all.

341
0:11:35,11 --> 0:11:37,25
However, if left untreated,

342
0:11:37,25 --> 0:11:38,99
the doctor said there's a risk of blindness.

343
0:11:38,99 --> 0:11:40,99
So, medical intervention is necessary.

344
0:11:40,99 --> 0:11:42,54
That means surgery might be required.

345
0:11:42,54 --> 0:11:44,78
I decided to use Quark to get some information first.

346
0:11:44,78 --> 0:11:47,1
To understand what exactly macular degeneration is.

347
0:11:47,1 --> 0:11:48,74
Fortunately, Quark does a great job breaking down the issues.

348
0:11:48,74 --> 0:11:51,18
He broke it down into five questions as usual.

349
0:11:51,18 --> 0:11:54,23
And I think he really got it, very accurately.

350
0:11:54,23 --> 0:11:57,63
I just want to say that my understanding of medicine is not very strong.

351
0:11:57,63 --> 0:11:58,55
I don't have professional knowledge.

352
0:11:58,55 --> 0:12:2,57
He needs to simplify the jargon into plain language.

353
0:12:2,57 --> 0:12:3,23
No problem.

354
0:12:3,23 --> 0:12:4,45
Then there's the search function.

355
0:12:4,45 --> 0:12:5,79
Including deep thinking.

356
0:12:5,79 --> 0:12:8,81
You can take a look at the AI's deep thinking process.

357
0:12:8,81 --> 0:12:9,9
Some steps are involved.

358
0:12:9,9 --> 0:12:12,26
In the end, it generated an educational document.

359
0:12:12,26 --> 0:12:14,85
Firstly, what is macular degeneration?

360
0:12:14,85 --> 0:12:16,99
Then, the common causes.

361
0:12:16,99 --> 0:12:17,91
It's explained quite accurately.

362
0:12:17,91 --> 0:12:21,28
My mom indeed has something similar to a degenerative condition.

363
0:12:21,28 --> 0:12:22,46
It's due to her advanced age.

364
0:12:22,46 --> 0:12:24,58
Her retina has undergone changes.

365
0:12:24,58 --> 0:12:27,2
And it includes some typical symptoms.

366
0:12:27,2 --> 0:12:30,52
These symptoms match my mom’s quite well.

367
0:12:30,52 --> 0:12:33,4
The next step is how to diagnose it.

368
0:12:33,4 --> 0:12:35,3
The next step is the treatment method.

369
0:12:35,3 --> 0:12:38,7
Then, the sixth section is about prevention and daily management.

370
0:12:38,7 --> 0:12:39,21
He provided some suggestions.

371
0:12:39,21 --> 0:12:42,99
Including the differences among various types of macular degeneration.

372
0:12:42,99 --> 0:12:43,67
In my opinion,

373
0:12:43,67 --> 0:12:45,82
If it's not the case right now that,

374
0:12:45,82 --> 0:12:47,3
My mom was just diagnosed with this condition.

375
0:12:47,3 --> 0:12:48,5
I have already gained some understanding.

376
0:12:48,5 --> 0:12:51,18
But if you’ve just found out you have this condition,

377
0:12:51,18 --> 0:12:54,13
I think such a search result would be helpful.

378
0:12:54,13 --> 0:12:55,75
will give me a preliminary understanding

379
0:12:55,75 --> 0:12:58,62
which will be a great help in learning about the disease

380
0:12:58,62 --> 0:13:1,3
so the next step is to continue asking her

381
0:13:1,3 --> 0:13:3,62
my mom is scheduled to have surgery in early June

382
0:13:3,62 --> 0:13:4,74
I will also return to Beijing

383
0:13:4,74 --> 0:13:6,14
and I’ll ask Qwen as well

384
0:13:6,14 --> 0:13:9,68
about what precautions should be taken before and after the surgery

385
0:13:9,68 --> 0:13:12,9
these questions are definitely better asked to the doctor

386
0:13:12,9 --> 0:13:13,96
but the doctor is very busy

387
0:13:13,96 --> 0:13:15,54
and may not cover everything

388
0:13:15,54 --> 0:13:17,26
Discuss these matters with our family members who are patients

389
0:13:17,26 --> 0:13:19,73
So it’s definitely beneficial to do some research yourself first

390
0:13:19,73 --> 0:13:21,25
Fortunately, in this issue

391
0:13:21,25 --> 0:13:24,65
I’ve asked quite a number of questions, actually

392
0:13:24,65 --> 0:13:25,77
And they are rather complex

393
0:13:25,77 --> 0:13:28,67
Then I said I want a comprehensive recommendation, right?

394
0:13:28,67 --> 0:13:30,99
He is still thinking it over

395
0:13:30,99 --> 0:13:32,27
This comprehensive recommendation of mine

396
0:13:32,27 --> 0:13:34,5
What I actually want

397
0:13:34,5 --> 0:13:35,53
It breaks down into five points

398
0:13:35,53 --> 0:13:39,25
One is that he needs to look up the surgery for macular pucker and holes.

399
0:13:39,25 --> 0:13:40,18
The indications for the procedure.

400
0:13:40,18 --> 0:13:42,9
The main success rates and complication data of the surgery.

401
0:13:42,9 --> 0:13:45,88
Also, which ophthalmology hospitals in the country are considered good.

402
0:13:45,88 --> 0:13:48,12
And the preoperative preparation and postoperative care.

403
0:13:48,12 --> 0:13:49,64
Some important points to note about postoperative recovery.

404
0:13:49,64 --> 0:13:51,74
As well as various protective measures.

405
0:13:51,74 --> 0:13:53,42
After breaking down the issue, he then proceeded to conduct a thorough search.

406
0:13:53,42 --> 0:13:54,78
He carried out a detailed search.

407
0:13:54,78 --> 0:13:56,18
During the search process.

408
0:13:56,18 --> 0:13:58,599
We can see Quark's unique advantages.

409
0:13:58,599 --> 0:14:1,379
Quark is backed by Alibaba's authoritative database.

410
0:14:1,379 --> 0:14:2,679
Alibaba's authoritative database

411
0:14:2,679 --> 0:14:5,399
has strong advantages in two areas.

412
0:14:5,399 --> 0:14:6,95
The first area is health and wellness.

413
0:14:6,95 --> 0:14:8,39
The second area is academia.

414
0:14:8,39 --> 0:14:10,77
When it comes to the medical issue I searched for,

415
0:14:10,77 --> 0:14:13,14
Quark has a vast medical database.

416
0:14:13,14 --> 0:14:15,14
It collaborates with over 60 medical institutions for content.

417
0:14:15,14 --> 0:14:18,22
Moreover, it has a three-tier review process to enhance content quality.

418
0:14:18,22 --> 0:14:19,24
The review mechanism

419
0:14:19,24 --> 0:14:21,56
In terms of academic standards, it also has an E level

420
0:14:21,56 --> 0:14:24,68
It collaborates with both domestic and international literature databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, and Weipu

421
0:14:24,68 --> 0:14:27,34
Therefore, its search results are quite reliable

422
0:14:27,34 --> 0:14:28,56
Let's see what it comes up with

423
0:14:28,56 --> 0:14:30,62
After deep consideration by Quark

424
0:14:30,62 --> 0:14:33,59
It provided several modules

425
0:14:33,59 --> 0:14:35,77
The first module is treatment recommendations

426
0:14:35,77 --> 0:14:38,17
The second module is the recommendation for ophthalmology hospitals.

427
0:14:38,17 --> 0:14:39,91
The third module is about surgical risks

428
0:14:39,91 --> 0:14:40,87
There are also complications

429
0:14:40,87 --> 0:14:43,1
including preoperative precautions

430
0:14:43,1 --> 0:14:43,95
postoperative care

431
0:14:43,95 --> 0:14:45,27
care and follow-up

432
0:14:45,27 --> 0:14:47,14
and lifestyle considerations

433
0:14:47,14 --> 0:14:50,87
as well as the consequences of delayed surgery and other questions

434
0:14:50,87 --> 0:14:52,69
This basically covers everything

435
0:14:52,69 --> 0:14:54,67
It includes all the issues I mentioned

436
0:14:54,67 --> 0:14:58,48
and even addresses some additional questions that might interest me

437
0:14:58,48 --> 0:14:59,72
Quark’s response

438
0:14:59,72 --> 0:15:0,92
After reading it carefully

439
0:15:0,92 --> 0:15:1,98
After a thorough understanding

440
0:15:1,98 --> 0:15:3,8
I immediately forwarded it to my mom

441
0:15:3,8 --> 0:15:6,6
To help her with some issues regarding this illness

442
0:15:6,6 --> 0:15:9,199
And the daily life concerns as well as pre-surgery preparations

443
0:15:9,199 --> 0:15:11,68
Kuake will soon be rolling out Deep Search Pro

444
0:15:11,68 --> 0:15:13,76
So what exactly is Deep Search Pro?

445
0:15:13,76 --> 0:15:16,22
You can think of it as a deep research feature

446
0:15:16,22 --> 0:15:18,12
It essentially treats your question

447
0:15:18,12 --> 0:15:20,52
As a research project

448
0:15:20,52 --> 0:15:21,62
Treat it as a project

449
0:15:21,62 --> 0:15:24,48
In the end, it will generate a comprehensive project report

450
0:15:24,48 --> 0:15:26,64
It is particularly suitable for those with extensive depth

451
0:15:26,64 --> 0:15:28,96
Research questions with in-depth studies

452
0:15:28,96 --> 0:15:31,48
So I look forward to Quark launching this feature soon

453
0:15:31,48 --> 0:15:33,76
Next, let me show you a demonstration

454
0:15:45,72 --> 0:15:48,36
Many people in the AI industry are saying

455
0:15:48,36 --> 0:15:50,68
That 2025 is the Year of A-town

456
0:15:50,68 --> 0:15:54,6
What I mean by that is the concept of an agent

457
0:15:54,6 --> 0:15:56,6
It is very likely to evolve with the development of the AI industry

458
0:15:56,6 --> 0:15:58,32
gradually becoming less ambiguous

459
0:15:58,32 --> 0:16:0,21
and boundaries may completely disappear

460
0:16:0,21 --> 0:16:2,73
it's highly likely that this agent thing will, in the coming years

461
0:16:2,73 --> 0:16:4,45
move from specialized applications

462
0:16:4,45 --> 0:16:7,51
I clearly know what an AI agent is

463
0:16:7,51 --> 0:16:9,13
from such a state

464
0:16:9,13 --> 0:16:12,53
it will merge into other AI tools

465
0:16:12,53 --> 0:16:13,97
becoming a front-end feature

466
0:16:13,97 --> 0:16:16,13
for example, it can be used in searches like this

467
0:16:16,13 --> 0:16:19,0
including breaking down problems in AIGC

468
0:16:19,0 --> 0:16:20,72
Go ahead and streamline the workflow in advance

469
0:16:20,72 --> 0:16:22,26
turning it into a preliminary step

470
0:16:22,26 --> 0:16:23,5
Regarding this update of Quark

471
0:16:23,5 --> 0:16:25,5
it has introduced deep search for the first time in China

472
0:16:25,5 --> 0:16:27,75
I think it's a very interesting and valuable exploration

473
0:16:27,75 --> 0:16:29,33
The key is, it's also very practical

474
0:16:29,33 --> 0:16:32,9
I recommend everyone give this feature a try.

475
0:16:32,9 --> 0:16:32,67
I'm Lao Jiang

476
0:16:32,67 --> 0:16:33,83
I'm someone who enjoys figuring things out

477
0:16:33,83 --> 0:16:36,93
enjoys sharing their knowledge and insights

478
0:16:36,93 --> 0:16:38,51
There's also an UPloader who thinks deeply like this.

479
0:16:38,51 --> 0:16:42,5
This year, there will be many updates on the AI industry.

480
0:16:42,5 --> 0:16:43,37
We'll explore industry trends.

481
0:16:43,37 --> 0:16:45,22
Including some insightful thoughts.

482
0:16:45,22 --> 0:16:48,3
And practical feature reviews and explanations.

483
0:16:48,3 --> 0:16:50,54
If you find this episode useful,

484
0:16:50,54 --> 0:16:51,22
inspiring,

485
0:16:51,22 --> 0:16:52,2
Please give me a Triple Combo.

486
0:16:52,2 --> 0:16:53,4
And follow me

487
0:16:53,4 --> 0:16:54,0
See you in the next episode.
