0:0:0,62 --> 0:0:1,28
Hello everyone

2
0:0:1,28 --> 0:0:3,48
This is the summer of the Mid-Year Observations 2024

3
0:0:3,48 --> 0:0:6,5
So in the last video, I talked about

4
0:0:6,5 --> 0:0:8,59
Because the previous cycle was an unusual one

5
0:0:8,59 --> 0:0:11,69
A rather long growth period of about two to three decades

6
0:0:11,69 --> 0:0:12,94
With a very rapid growth rate

7
0:0:12,94 --> 0:0:14,66
During the previous cycle

8
0:0:14,66 --> 0:0:17,86
We actually had two methodologies

9
0:0:17,86 --> 0:0:18,94
One was collective

10
0:0:18,94 --> 0:0:20,52
One is personal.

11
0:0:20,52 --> 0:0:21,78
The narrative of learning and growth.

12
0:0:21,78 --> 0:0:26,1
As this growth phase comes to an end,

13
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:27,65
or reaches a turning point,

14
0:0:27,65 --> 0:0:29,23
this narrative of learning and growth,

15
0:0:29,23 --> 0:0:31,45
after bankruptcy, creates a narrative void,

16
0:0:31,45 --> 0:0:32,95
We discussed this issue in the last episode.

17
0:0:32,95 --> 0:0:35,23
And he provided for the new generation

18
0:0:35,23 --> 0:0:37,87
primarily young people, in a widespread manner.

19
0:0:37,87 --> 0:0:38,99
The issue of value loss

20
0:0:38,99 --> 0:0:42,33
which is feeling lost, confused, or having energy

21
0:0:42,33 --> 0:0:44,43
but not knowing where to direct it

22
0:0:44,43 --> 0:0:47,97
In this episode, we’ll discuss this narrative void

23
0:0:47,97 --> 0:0:51,45
this misplaced passion for life

24
0:0:51,45 --> 0:0:53,35
this uncertainty about what to do

25
0:0:53,35 --> 0:0:54,51
this confusion about who I am

26
0:0:54,51 --> 0:0:57,12
this lack of direction on where to channel my efforts

27
0:0:57,12 --> 0:0:58,98
this really uncomfortable feeling

28
0:0:58,98 --> 0:1:1,439
Which direction should we take?

29
0:1:1,439 --> 0:1:3,39
What kind of answer should we seek?

30
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:5,61
So, for this video, let's start by talking about uh

31
0:1:5,61 --> 0:1:7,95
The framework is to briefly mention a few

32
0:1:7,95 --> 0:1:9,91
Solutions I believe are unfeasible

33
0:1:9,91 --> 0:1:12,11
For example, in the realm of collective narratives

34
0:1:12,11 --> 0:1:13,65
There's a particularly simple and brutal answer

35
0:1:13,65 --> 0:1:14,87
A very ready-made answer

36
0:1:14,87 --> 0:1:17,1
Which is to respond to hatred with hatred

37
0:1:17,1 --> 0:1:20,3
An individual can easily develop hatred towards other countries,

38
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:21,2
other cultures,

39
0:1:21,2 --> 0:1:22,51
other groups,

40
0:1:22,51 --> 0:1:24,31
another gender of public figures,

41
0:1:24,31 --> 0:1:25,57
Regarding a certain ideology

42
0:1:25,57 --> 0:1:27,5
a certain brand,

43
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:30,84
or even things they don't understand.

44
0:1:30,84 --> 0:1:31,54
This hatred,

45
0:1:31,54 --> 0:1:35,26
often stems from a sense of self-righteousness.

46
0:1:35,26 --> 0:1:36,78
Then many people

47
0:1:36,78 --> 0:1:40,14
a group of people can form a community due to a shared hatred

48
0:1:40,14 --> 0:1:42,9
they call it a community of hatred

49
0:1:42,9 --> 0:1:43,209
So this community of hatred

50
0:1:43,209 --> 0:1:44,969
actually constructs a new

51
0:1:44,969 --> 0:1:46,569
temporary collective narrative

52
0:1:46,569 --> 0:1:49,19
as it seems everyone is together

53
0:1:49,19 --> 0:1:50,75
and united for a common cause

54
0:1:50,75 --> 0:1:52,25
like getting rid of someone

55
0:1:52,25 --> 0:1:55,96
Or I need to determine who to harm or damage

56
0:1:55,96 --> 0:1:57,58
Then gather together

57
0:1:57,58 --> 0:2:0,46
This forms a temporary collective narrative

58
0:2:0,46 --> 0:2:1,9
In my opinion

59
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:3,98
We have already entered an era

60
0:2:3,98 --> 0:2:8,3
Where we form communities more out of hate than love

61
0:2:8,3 --> 0:2:10,8
And find ourselves in such an environment

62
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:11,82
I think the generation born after 2005

63
0:2:11,82 --> 0:2:12,22
The generation born after 2005

64
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:14,33
Those born in the 2010s live in this era

65
0:2:14,33 --> 0:2:14,89
lacking a basis for comparison

66
0:2:14,89 --> 0:2:15,97
which might lead to a lack of awareness

67
0:2:15,97 --> 0:2:17,72
But from my own perspective

68
0:2:17,72 --> 0:2:20,34
I can sense a truly chilling contrast

69
0:2:20,34 --> 0:2:22,2
My middle school days

70
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:23,9
were around 2005

71
0:2:23,9 --> 0:2:27,4
a time before the advent of mobile internet

72
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:30,65
I’ll use changes in the sports domain to illustrate this issue

73
0:2:30,65 --> 0:2:32,3
Because it's incredibly efficient.

74
0:2:32,3 --> 0:2:32,89
It's particularly noticeable.

75
0:2:32,89 --> 0:2:37,49
Back then, sports fans were divided by their passion.

76
0:2:37,49 --> 0:2:40,37
For example, what was everyone's identity?

77
0:2:40,37 --> 0:2:41,53
You were an Allen Iverson fan.

78
0:2:41,53 --> 0:2:42,88
I was a Vince Carter fan.

79
0:2:42,88 --> 0:2:43,88
He was a Tracy McGrady fan.

80
0:2:43,88 --> 0:2:45,3
This person was a Kobe Bryant fan.

81
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:46,56
Or, for instance, in the soccer world.

82
0:2:46,56 --> 0:2:47,36
You're a Manchester United fan.

83
0:2:47,36 --> 0:2:48,6
I'm a Manchester City fan.

84
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:51,81
So we might each have our favorite player,

85
0:2:51,81 --> 0:2:53,33
team, or style of play.

86
0:2:53,33 --> 0:2:56,41
And that can lead to conflicts between different groups.

87
0:2:56,41 --> 0:2:57,96
For instance, Manchester,

88
0:2:57,96 --> 0:3:0,42
whether the sky over Manchester is blue or red, ha ha.

89
0:3:0,42 --> 0:3:2,5
This debate has been going on for decades without a clear answer.

90
0:3:2,5 --> 0:3:4,16
There can be all sorts of conflicts involved.

91
0:3:4,16 --> 0:3:4,86
various arguments

92
0:3:4,86 --> 0:3:5,91
even quite intense

93
0:3:5,91 --> 0:3:8,15
but at that time

94
0:3:8,15 --> 0:3:11,53
the underlying logic among different groups was love and joy

95
0:3:11,53 --> 0:3:11,75
love

96
0:3:11,75 --> 0:3:12,49
a passionate love

97
0:3:12,49 --> 0:3:16,709
so the conflicts were byproducts of that love

98
0:3:16,709 --> 0:3:17,889
this might sound a bit abstract

99
0:3:17,889 --> 0:3:19,929
but I believe those who experienced that era as sports fans

100
0:3:19,929 --> 0:3:21,409
You should get my point

101
0:3:21,409 --> 0:3:24,89
But in recent years, the situation has changed quite noticeably

102
0:3:24,89 --> 0:3:28,49
In recent years, the sports community has been divided by negativity

103
0:3:28,49 --> 0:3:31,5
In basketball, the biggest draw is the criticism of LeBron and Curry

104
0:3:31,5 --> 0:3:33,44
In football, the biggest controversy revolves around Cristiano Ronaldo's critics

105
0:3:33,44 --> 0:3:34,12
And Messi's critics

106
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:35,74
For example, we can see this on Bilibili

107
0:3:35,74 --> 0:3:37,22
The sports section on Bilibili

108
0:3:37,22 --> 0:3:39,6
I don't mean any disrespect

109
0:3:39,6 --> 0:3:39,63
Respect

110
0:3:39,63 --> 0:3:40,87
I'm a bit of a joker myself

111
0:3:40,87 --> 0:3:41,79
I also follow these accounts

112
0:3:41,79 --> 0:3:43,15
but I just use them as examples

113
0:3:43,15 --> 0:3:45,75
So, which account has the most traffic in the sports section on Bilibili?

114
0:3:45,75 --> 0:3:46,68
It's a professional actor

115
0:3:46,68 --> 0:3:50,4
It's the real football fans, like Football Old Eight, who incorporate football elements, right?

116
0:3:50,4 --> 0:3:51,48
On the surface

117
0:3:51,48 --> 0:3:52,44
You might think

118
0:3:52,44 --> 0:3:55,0
This phenomenon isn't much different from 20 years ago.

119
0:3:55,0 --> 0:3:57,6
Because there were rivals back then as well.

120
0:3:57,6 --> 0:3:58,42
Now, Zhan Ku is also a rival.

121
0:3:58,42 --> 0:3:59,3
Melo is also a rival.

122
0:3:59,3 --> 0:4:2,68
The mutual attacks between the two fan groups seem not much different.

123
0:4:2,68 --> 0:4:3,9
But is that really the case?

124
0:4:3,9 --> 0:4:5,92
Do you think all the audience at a real fan club meeting

125
0:4:5,92 --> 0:4:7,19
really all like Messi?

126
0:4:7,19 --> 0:4:8,47
or the audience watching professional actors?

127
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:10,73
Do they really all love Curry, Jokic, or Kobe?

128
0:4:10,73 --> 0:4:11,459
Not necessarily.

129
0:4:11,459 --> 0:4:15,99
Even my observation is that many people might not necessarily follow

130
0:4:15,99 --> 0:4:15,299
They

131
0:4:15,299 --> 0:4:17,59
aren't necessarily fans of soccer or basketball.

132
0:4:17,59 --> 0:4:19,65
The more fundamental underlying logic

133
0:4:19,65 --> 0:4:22,53
might be that people enjoy the emotional pleasure and sense of superiority

134
0:4:22,53 --> 0:4:25,11
that comes from criticizing an idol,

135
0:4:25,11 --> 0:4:27,23
even a sense of justice and power.

136
0:4:27,23 --> 0:4:30,63
And then there are netizens who attack the opposing camp

137
0:4:30,63 --> 0:4:32,59
To make them lose face and break down

138
0:4:32,59 --> 0:4:35,57
The sense of power and achievement from causing harm

139
0:4:35,57 --> 0:4:38,25
People gather together because of these things

140
0:4:38,25 --> 0:4:40,17
Forming a certain dark group

141
0:4:40,17 --> 0:4:41,49
But don't misunderstand

142
0:4:41,49 --> 0:4:44,26
I have no issue with these UPloaders themselves.

143
0:4:44,26 --> 0:4:45,18
I'm just using them as examples

144
0:4:45,18 --> 0:4:46,24
To illustrate a bigger picture

145
0:4:46,24 --> 0:4:47,42
The changes in the sports world

146
0:4:47,42 --> 0:4:49,96
can more clearly illustrate this emotional mechanism

147
0:4:49,96 --> 0:4:53,2
So, who mainly constitutes these hate groups?

148
0:4:53,2 --> 0:4:54,24
Who would join them?

149
0:4:54,24 --> 0:4:55,34
It's not me, Keqing

150
0:4:55,34 --> 0:4:56,56
It's not that I like to insult my pen pals

151
0:4:56,56 --> 0:4:59,25
But it really is these hate groups

152
0:4:59,25 --> 0:5:0,99
that are primarily made up of students without jobs

153
0:5:0,99 --> 0:5:1,35
Why is that?

154
0:5:1,35 --> 0:5:4,49
Because full-time students haven’t worked for many years, they are quite young.

155
0:5:4,49 --> 0:5:5,87
Then, they are emotionally rich.

156
0:5:5,87 --> 0:5:7,89
They are also mentally active due to their youth.

157
0:5:7,89 --> 0:5:8,49
With strong imagination,

158
0:5:8,49 --> 0:5:9,83
and highly emotional,

159
0:5:9,83 --> 0:5:13,3
they tend to transform into internet warriors.

160
0:5:13,3 --> 0:5:14,9
Not just targeting the sports world,

161
0:5:14,9 --> 0:5:17,58
but also a variety of different battle targets.

162
0:5:17,58 --> 0:5:18,86
They consider themselves righteous.

163
0:5:18,86 --> 0:5:19,84
The crazy Tatta opens up

164
0:5:19,84 --> 0:5:21,16
Today I’ll go viral as an internet celebrity

165
0:5:21,16 --> 0:5:22,61
Tomorrow I’ll become a public intellectual

166
0:5:22,61 --> 0:5:25,38
The day after, I’ll promote a brand or platform

167
0:5:25,38 --> 0:5:26,62
What do they believe in?

168
0:5:26,62 --> 0:5:27,78
Fighting for a while feels good

169
0:5:27,78 --> 0:5:28,74
Fighting all the time feels great

170
0:5:28,74 --> 0:5:29,64
Fighting all the time feels great

171
0:5:29,64 --> 0:5:31,92
Then they tirelessly rush from one battlefield to another

172
0:5:31,92 --> 0:5:33,96
The switching of enemy targets is very swift.

173
0:5:33,96 --> 0:5:34,96
On a weekly basis,

174
0:5:34,96 --> 0:5:36,42
they come up with a lot of new jokes,

175
0:5:36,42 --> 0:5:38,26
and then launch their unicycle copy and paste attacks,

176
0:5:38,26 --> 0:5:39,58
conquering one comment section after another

177
0:5:39,58 --> 0:5:40,86
They've achieved many glorious victories.

178
0:5:40,86 --> 0:5:42,16
This is their modus operandi.

179
0:5:42,16 --> 0:5:45,169
Their time, energy, and passion are being drained.

180
0:5:45,169 --> 0:5:45,789
And then

181
0:5:45,789 --> 0:5:46,569
Personally, I think

182
0:5:46,569 --> 0:5:48,369
this kind of substitute new collective narrative

183
0:5:48,369 --> 0:5:50,449
doesn't bring any real value.

184
0:5:50,449 --> 0:5:50,769
Why?

185
0:5:50,769 --> 0:5:53,0
Because they are either built on extreme emotions

186
0:5:53,0 --> 0:5:55,76
or on a rather narrow or radical perception

187
0:5:55,76 --> 0:5:57,1
and understanding of the world.

188
0:5:57,1 --> 0:6:0,88
Such a low-quality, crude, and piecemeal collective trend

189
0:6:0,88 --> 0:6:2,98
is also quite gamified.

190
0:6:2,98 --> 0:6:4,2
The people involved

191
0:6:4,2 --> 0:6:6,42
I think many of them don't know themselves

192
0:6:6,42 --> 0:6:7,46
what I want

193
0:6:7,46 --> 0:6:8,5
what I want to achieve

194
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:10,32
how I can achieve it

195
0:6:10,32 --> 0:6:11,88
it's not as serious as that

196
0:6:11,88 --> 0:6:13,4
it's more gamified

197
0:6:13,4 --> 0:6:14,8
so it can't provide people with

198
0:6:14,8 --> 0:6:18,18
even a slightly longer-lasting and solid value structure

199
0:6:18,18 --> 0:6:19,12
It can't be constructed

200
0:6:19,12 --> 0:6:20,8
And we need to move beyond individual perspectives

201
0:6:20,8 --> 0:6:23,65
To look at public hate communities

202
0:6:23,65 --> 0:6:26,11
Clearly, this has posed significant risks to society and the public opinion environment.

203
0:6:26,11 --> 0:6:29,3
Because affection can be satisfied

204
0:6:29,3 --> 0:6:30,57
I like a particular soccer star

205
0:6:30,57 --> 0:6:31,93
I can get closer to him

206
0:6:31,93 --> 0:6:33,63
Imitate his playing style

207
0:6:33,63 --> 0:6:34,75
And watch his matches

208
0:6:34,75 --> 0:6:36,23
I can be satisfied

209
0:6:36,23 --> 0:6:40,14
However, hatred fueled by resentment is never satisfied

210
0:6:40,14 --> 0:6:41,42
They only sink to lower depths

211
0:6:41,42 --> 0:6:42,2
Getting lower and lower

212
0:6:42,2 --> 0:6:43,28
The scope of hatred expands

213
0:6:43,28 --> 0:6:44,3
We see this on the internet

214
0:6:44,3 --> 0:6:47,589
A few years ago, people would post hateful comments about an issue

215
0:6:47,589 --> 0:6:48,449
Often, why was that?

216
0:6:48,449 --> 0:6:51,25
Because the other party had caused them real harm

217
0:6:51,25 --> 0:6:52,21
Only you would do that

218
0:6:52,21 --> 0:6:53,5
It later turned into

219
0:6:53,5 --> 0:6:54,45
As long as you dislike it aesthetically

220
0:6:54,45 --> 0:6:56,26
You can freely insult and vent

221
0:6:56,26 --> 0:6:58,18
Now I realize the main point is that it's fun

222
0:6:58,18 --> 0:6:59,5
This meme is popular enough

223
0:6:59,5 --> 0:7:3,13
To become a shared reason for joining the hate

224
0:7:3,13 --> 0:7:4,93
This naturally greatly increases

225
0:7:4,93 --> 0:7:6,37
The distrust between people

226
0:7:6,37 --> 0:7:7,86
increased societal vulnerability

227
0:7:7,86 --> 0:7:8,78
while you might say

228
0:7:8,78 --> 0:7:9,54
it's no big deal

229
0:7:9,54 --> 0:7:11,46
these hate speeches are just talk

230
0:7:11,46 --> 0:7:12,0
not to be taken seriously

231
0:7:12,0 --> 0:7:12,82
just for fun

232
0:7:12,82 --> 0:7:15,2
but first, you don't take it seriously

233
0:7:15,2 --> 0:7:16,72
there are always more emotional people

234
0:7:16,72 --> 0:7:17,62
who are doing worse

235
0:7:17,62 --> 0:7:18,98
Younger people tend to take things more seriously

236
0:7:18,98 --> 0:7:20,2
followed by society

237
0:7:20,2 --> 0:7:21,56
society is indeed not that easy

238
0:7:21,56 --> 0:7:23,14
because of the collapse due to these internet comments

239
0:7:23,14 --> 0:7:25,8
but the fragility of society will increase

240
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:25,8
what I just mentioned

241
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:27,56
the distrust between people will increase

242
0:7:27,56 --> 0:7:28,84
the willingness to cooperate will diminish

243
0:7:28,84 --> 0:7:31,2
this is a comprehensive negative impact on the entire society

244
0:7:31,2 --> 0:7:32,2
What was it in the end?

245
0:7:32,2 --> 0:7:33,48
In the end, it's what I observed in Weiquan.

246
0:7:33,48 --> 0:7:34,2
I've mentioned this before.

247
0:7:34,2 --> 0:7:35,28
I believe in this.

248
0:7:35,28 --> 0:7:37,88
People are influenced by how things are expressed.

249
0:7:37,88 --> 0:7:40,98
Language, thought, and expression are interconnected.

250
0:7:40,98 --> 0:7:42,2
You criticize this today,

251
0:7:42,2 --> 0:7:43,8
and criticize that tomorrow,

252
0:7:43,8 --> 0:7:45,55
and you might feel like you're just having some fun.

253
0:7:45,55 --> 0:7:48,94
But the words that come out of your mouth will flow upstream

254
0:7:48,94 --> 0:7:49,98
and dirty your mind

255
0:7:49,98 --> 0:7:52,48
turning you into someone with extreme conflicts

256
0:7:52,48 --> 0:7:53,95
in your thinking and combative mindset

257
0:7:53,95 --> 0:7:55,69
you will be permeated in this way

258
0:7:55,69 --> 0:7:58,51
and such a state will shut down your potential for growth

259
0:7:58,51 --> 0:8:1,93
making you a worse person cognitively, emotionally, and socially

260
0:8:1,93 --> 0:8:4,15
So I’m not against being a fun-loving person

261
0:8:4,15 --> 0:8:5,19
in fact, I’m a fun-loving person myself

262
0:8:5,19 --> 0:8:7,29
But I do oppose everyone becoming a hater.

263
0:8:7,29 --> 0:8:8,93
Being a hater is a terrible state to be in.

264
0:8:8,93 --> 0:8:12,19
And I might say something that could really rub you the wrong way,

265
0:8:12,19 --> 0:8:14,87
but instead of becoming a hater,

266
0:8:14,87 --> 0:8:16,83
joining some hate-filled community,

267
0:8:16,83 --> 0:8:17,84
in my opinion,

268
0:8:17,84 --> 0:8:20,86
it’s better to join a fandom and chase after stars.

269
0:8:20,86 --> 0:8:23,16
Because even shallow, specific love,

270
0:8:23,16 --> 0:8:25,47
even if it’s shallow and specific, is still love.

271
0:8:25,47 --> 0:8:29,6
It's better than shallow, diffuse hatred.

272
0:8:29,6 --> 0:8:30,78
This is what I think.

273
0:8:30,78 --> 0:8:34,139
It's a clear mistake or a poor answer.

274
0:8:34,139 --> 0:8:35,339
Apart from this answer,

275
0:8:35,339 --> 0:8:36,219
Besides hatred,

276
0:8:36,219 --> 0:8:37,839
are there other ways out for collective narratives?

277
0:8:37,839 --> 0:8:39,19
Yes, there are.

278
0:8:39,19 --> 0:8:41,65
There are some alternative value propositions.

279
0:8:41,65 --> 0:8:44,69
But few truly fit our land and system.

280
0:8:44,69 --> 0:8:45,71
For instance, religion

281
0:8:45,71 --> 0:8:49,33
Religion has been proven over thousands of years

282
0:8:49,33 --> 0:8:51,47
to have a profoundly significant impact

283
0:8:51,47 --> 0:8:52,85
in providing value

284
0:8:52,85 --> 0:8:55,62
and a sense of belonging and meaning through its narrative system, right?

285
0:8:55,62 --> 0:8:57,58
But we don't really talk about this kind of thing here

286
0:8:57,58 --> 0:8:59,88
And even in the West, after entering modern society

287
0:8:59,88 --> 0:9:1,48
God has been dead for many years

288
0:9:1,48 --> 0:9:4,38
This religious narrative has been on the decline and is almost over

289
0:9:4,38 --> 0:9:7,38
There are also some relatively smaller groups or communities

290
0:9:7,38 --> 0:9:10,849
For example, the various NGOs that are sprouting up all over the United States

291
0:9:10,849 --> 0:9:14,129
And then there are even smaller communities for alcohol and drug rehabilitation

292
0:9:14,129 --> 0:9:16,229
But the situation in our country is quite different

293
0:9:16,229 --> 0:9:17,329
The scale is different

294
0:9:17,329 --> 0:9:18,249
The regulation is different

295
0:9:18,249 --> 0:9:19,289
The culture is different as well

296
0:9:19,289 --> 0:9:21,609
These kinds of things find it hard to thrive

297
0:9:21,609 --> 0:9:22,769
Now that we've talked about collective narratives

298
0:9:22,769 --> 0:9:24,209
Let's take a closer look at personal narratives.

299
0:9:24,209 --> 0:9:27,149
In addition to growth-oriented learning, there's something else to consider in personal narratives.

300
0:9:27,149 --> 0:9:29,49
For instance, before the reform and opening-up, we had a self-sufficient narrative of urban residents.

301
0:9:29,49 --> 0:9:32,94
For example, before the Reform and Opening up

302
0:9:32,94 --> 0:9:36,62
or 'The Long Season'.

303
0:9:36,62 --> 0:9:38,22
I'm referring to the state of the workers in those large compounds.

304
0:9:38,22 --> 0:9:39,26
They actually had individual values beyond the scope of learning.

305
0:9:45,32 --> 0:9:46,94
They have stable production skills.

306
0:9:46,94 --> 0:9:49,22
They maintain stable family and community relationships.

307
0:9:49,22 --> 0:9:52,89
They have a job security that lasts almost a lifetime.

308
0:9:52,89 --> 0:9:54,669
They also enjoy a fairly good social status.

309
0:9:54,669 --> 0:9:55,89
Right?

310
0:9:55,89 --> 0:9:58,9
These things make them people with dignity.

311
0:9:58,9 --> 0:9:59,29
People who take pride in themselves.

312
0:9:59,29 --> 0:10:2,15
They have their own way of life and cultural narrative.

313
0:10:2,15 --> 0:10:5,48
But when we look at these things,

314
0:10:5,48 --> 0:10:8,58
While it might seem beautiful or nostalgic to you,

315
0:10:8,58 --> 0:10:9,58
you need to understand,

316
0:10:9,58 --> 0:10:12,14
this narrative of the citizens has a strong historical context.

317
0:10:12,14 --> 0:10:12,98
It was a time when the market

318
0:10:12,98 --> 0:10:15,1
had very limited competition,

319
0:10:15,1 --> 0:10:16,74
and the private economy had yet to emerge.

320
0:10:16,74 --> 0:10:18,13
Social mobility was very low,

321
0:10:18,13 --> 0:10:19,33
job assignments were fixed,

322
0:10:19,33 --> 0:10:21,45
and the frequency of information exchange was also low.

323
0:10:21,45 --> 0:10:23,5
These premises you have

324
0:10:23,5 --> 0:10:25,73
have given rise to such a group of citizens

325
0:10:25,73 --> 0:10:27,19
who can lead this kind of life

326
0:10:27,19 --> 0:10:29,97
and enjoy a very enduring personal narrative

327
0:10:29,97 --> 0:10:32,13
that provides them with a sense of stability

328
0:10:32,13 --> 0:10:33,5
But with the Reform and Opening up

329
0:10:33,5 --> 0:10:34,44
and economic restructuring

330
0:10:34,44 --> 0:10:36,26
that era has passed

331
0:10:36,26 --> 0:10:37,3
This is the price of development

332
0:10:37,3 --> 0:10:38,94
I don't think there's much to regret.

333
0:10:38,94 --> 0:10:40,53
Because history has proven that

334
0:10:40,53 --> 0:10:41,99
openness is better than isolation.

335
0:10:41,99 --> 0:10:43,69
Movement is better than stagnation.

336
0:10:43,69 --> 0:10:45,57
Let me summarize the key points so far.

337
0:10:45,57 --> 0:10:48,24
During the last major growth cycle,

338
0:10:48,24 --> 0:10:49,52
we had two narratives, right?

339
0:10:49,52 --> 0:10:52,12
Personal and collective academic narratives.

340
0:10:52,12 --> 0:10:53,0
In addition to these,

341
0:10:53,0 --> 0:10:55,56
What alternative solutions are there to what I mentioned earlier?

342
0:10:55,56 --> 0:10:57,2
After Yingxu Xu Xu's bankruptcy,

343
0:10:57,2 --> 0:10:59,37
we can have a community of shared grievances,

344
0:10:59,37 --> 0:11:1,21
an alternative collective narrative in a loose form,

345
0:11:1,21 --> 0:11:4,5
but I strongly believe that

346
0:11:4,5 --> 0:11:5,67
this is toxic and not worth promoting.

347
0:11:5,67 --> 0:11:6,75
Theoretically speaking,

348
0:11:6,75 --> 0:11:7,71
on the collective side,

349
0:11:7,71 --> 0:11:11,18
We might still have collective trends that are religious and communal.

350
0:11:11,18 --> 0:11:13,54
But this approach doesn't fit well with our land and people.

351
0:11:13,54 --> 0:11:15,2
Including individual aspects.

352
0:11:15,2 --> 0:11:16,38
At an earlier stage in time,

353
0:11:16,38 --> 0:11:19,1
The New China once had a static narrative of its citizens.

354
0:11:19,1 --> 0:11:21,6
But this has evolved with the process of Reform and Opening up.

355
0:11:22,9 --> 0:11:24,2
As the iron rice bowl faded away,

356
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:25,76
It has long since vanished.

357
0:11:25,76 --> 0:11:28,369
The alternative narratives that emerged amid this narrative crisis,

358
0:11:28,369 --> 0:11:29,189
Each come with their own set of issues.

359
0:11:29,189 --> 0:11:31,2
We urgently need a new narrative, right?

360
0:11:31,2 --> 0:11:32,18
What should it be?

361
0:11:32,18 --> 0:11:35,54
I think it should be firmly grounded in individual values.

362
0:11:35,54 --> 0:11:36,9
A self-actualizing narrative.

363
0:11:36,9 --> 0:11:38,4
That is, why am I valuable?

364
0:11:38,4 --> 0:11:39,54
Why am I satisfied with myself?

365
0:11:39,54 --> 0:11:41,7
Not because of what I've contributed to society,

366
0:11:41,7 --> 0:11:42,74
Some very different contributions,

367
0:11:42,74 --> 0:11:44,78
Nor because I earn more than others.

368
0:11:44,78 --> 0:11:45,36
I'm doing well

369
0:11:45,36 --> 0:11:47,24
but it's because I'm different from others

370
0:11:47,24 --> 0:11:50,26
I have my own unique intrinsic value

371
0:11:50,26 --> 0:11:53,37
and I have my own precious

372
0:11:53,37 --> 0:11:56,44
life experiences that no one else can replace

373
0:11:56,44 --> 0:11:57,7
and personal journeys

374
0:11:57,7 --> 0:12:0,76
such things either come from the construction of one's spiritual world

375
0:12:0,76 --> 0:12:2,36
what exactly is this spiritual world

376
0:12:2,36 --> 0:12:3,38
it varies from person to person

377
0:12:3,38 --> 0:12:5,99
Its foundation can be a knowledge-based reflection

378
0:12:5,99 --> 0:12:8,75
it can be an artistic aesthetic experience and system

379
0:12:8,75 --> 0:12:11,73
It could also be a subculture or something ideologized.

380
0:12:11,73 --> 0:12:13,45
It can also be the exploration of natural science.

381
0:12:13,45 --> 0:12:15,15
If you think what I'm saying is too abstract

382
0:12:15,15 --> 0:12:16,12
let me put it another way

383
0:12:16,12 --> 0:12:18,27
it's like the culture of the second dimension

384
0:12:18,27 --> 0:12:20,91
essentially, it's a spiritual sanctuary

385
0:12:20,91 --> 0:12:23,57
where you can gain experiences that transcend daily life

386
0:12:23,57 --> 0:12:24,35
Or

387
0:12:24,35 --> 0:12:25,87
this differentiated individual value

388
0:12:25,87 --> 0:12:28,49
It originates from creative practice

389
0:12:28,49 --> 0:12:31,879
for example, I discover that I have certain talents

390
0:12:31,879 --> 0:12:34,959
whether it's fixing things, drawing, or anything else

391
0:12:34,959 --> 0:12:36,159
or running as well

392
0:12:36,159 --> 0:12:38,67
My talent might not be exceptionally remarkable.

393
0:12:38,67 --> 0:12:40,31
He might just be a loyal son.

394
0:12:40,31 --> 0:12:42,41
but in this field, in this skill

395
0:12:42,41 --> 0:12:45,55
I can achieve continuous improvement internally.

396
0:12:45,55 --> 0:12:48,18
I can do things a bit differently from others.

397
0:12:48,18 --> 0:12:49,96
I can create something that brings me joy.

398
0:12:49,96 --> 0:12:51,66
Something that allows me to fulfill myself.

399
0:12:51,66 --> 0:12:54,4
These two possibilities form a framework.

400
0:12:54,4 --> 0:12:56,96
What I mentioned earlier is based on individual value.

401
0:12:56,96 --> 0:12:58,28
A narrative of self-actualization.

402
0:12:58,28 --> 0:12:59,8
I’ve said quite a bit.

403
0:12:59,8 --> 0:13:0,78
It might still sound a bit abstract.

404
0:13:0,78 --> 0:13:2,6
It might still be a bit abstract

405
0:13:2,6 --> 0:13:2,68
hard to grasp

406
0:13:2,68 --> 0:13:5,1
I think if you can't understand a particularly simple piece of content

407
0:13:5,1 --> 0:13:6,52
you could give it a listen

408
0:13:6,52 --> 0:13:8,46
from last year's King of Comedy stand-up show

409
0:13:8,46 --> 0:13:10,0
The talk show where Fu Hang won the championship

410
0:13:10,0 --> 0:13:11,58
rich in Fu Hang's delivery

411
0:13:11,58 --> 0:13:14,1
it's a methodology built on differentiation

412
0:13:14,1 --> 0:13:15,56
a personal narrative of self-actualization

413
0:13:15,56 --> 0:13:17,3
He says I'm quite ordinary

414
0:13:17,3 --> 0:13:17,92
I'm not impressive

415
0:13:17,92 --> 0:13:20,22
But I won't get discouraged because of that

416
0:13:20,22 --> 0:13:20,66
Why

417
0:13:20,66 --> 0:13:22,26
Because I'm a unique individual

418
0:13:22,26 --> 0:13:23,82
I can do things differently from others

419
0:13:23,82 --> 0:13:25,34
When it comes to my own life

420
0:13:25,34 --> 0:13:26,66
I'm content with who I am

421
0:13:26,66 --> 0:13:29,32
And that helps me maintain a healthy and positive mindset

422
0:13:29,32 --> 0:13:31,68
So he won the championship in this year's talk show

423
0:13:31,68 --> 0:13:32,36
he concluded by saying,

424
0:13:32,36 --> 0:13:33,62
as long as you dare to be yourself,

425
0:13:33,62 --> 0:13:34,76
someone will always fall in love with you.

426
0:13:34,76 --> 0:13:35,74
That's exactly what he meant.

427
0:13:35,74 --> 0:13:37,82
This core message is the source of his appeal.

428
0:13:37,82 --> 0:13:38,569
In my view,

429
0:13:38,569 --> 0:13:41,49
Fu Hang has become a cultural sensation in China

430
0:13:41,49 --> 0:13:42,709
in 2024.

431
0:13:42,709 --> 0:13:45,209
Apart from the reasons related to talk show techniques and styles

432
0:13:45,209 --> 0:13:47,55
he has tapped into the zeitgeist

433
0:13:47,55 --> 0:13:51,17
ordinary people resonate with and find comfort in him

434
0:13:51,17 --> 0:13:52,39
In my view

435
0:13:52,39 --> 0:13:53,79
this is the most fitting narrative for modern society

436
0:13:53,79 --> 0:13:55,85
and it's also a relatively healthy personal narrative

437
0:13:55,85 --> 0:13:57,55
if we trace its origins

438
0:13:57,55 --> 0:13:59,79
It originated with the beat generation in the United States.

439
0:13:59,79 --> 0:14:3,34
Young people in Europe and America are dealing with the crisis of modernity.

440
0:14:3,34 --> 0:14:6,76
a lifestyle and culture built over many decades

441
0:14:6,76 --> 0:14:9,34
he achieved a diversified self-actualization

442
0:14:9,34 --> 0:14:12,6
and replaced collective beliefs with psychological self-exploration

443
0:14:12,6 --> 0:14:15,32
substituted clan and village ties with voluntary communities and new forms of intimacy

444
0:14:15,32 --> 0:14:17,14
but it's unfortunate

445
0:14:17,14 --> 0:14:18,22
in the current global right-turn context

446
0:14:18,22 --> 0:14:20,98
this narrative of differentiated self-actualization

447
0:14:20,98 --> 0:14:22,96
has faced significant challenges and obstacles in its implementation

448
0:14:26,29 --> 0:14:27,97
For instance, I've observed an interesting mindset in recent years,

449
0:14:27,97 --> 0:14:29,41
a rather intriguing attitude,

450
0:14:29,41 --> 0:14:31,62
which is among many social Darwinism enthusiasts,

451
0:14:31,62 --> 0:14:32,38
social Darwinists,

452
0:14:32,38 --> 0:14:34,7
who are often from so-called lower social strata.

453
0:14:34,7 --> 0:14:37,52
At first, I was completely puzzled by this phenomenon.

454
0:14:37,52 --> 0:14:40,86
If society truly followed the law of the jungle,

455
0:14:40,86 --> 0:14:42,76
with everyone engaging in ruthless competition without limits,

456
0:14:42,76 --> 0:14:44,16
those with fewer social resources

457
0:14:44,16 --> 0:14:45,6
a society with less information at the bottom

458
0:14:45,6 --> 0:14:47,52
is absolutely much worse than now

459
0:14:47,52 --> 0:14:50,4
but they easily fall into the trap of simplistic answers

460
0:14:50,4 --> 0:14:53,92
And it might be even more extreme than the sophisticated egoism of social climbers.

461
0:14:53,92 --> 0:14:57,84
they are quick to call for violence and aggression in their words and thoughts

462
0:14:57,84 --> 0:14:59,78
they completely deny humanistic values

463
0:14:59,78 --> 0:15:0,96
deny universal values

464
0:15:0,96 --> 0:15:3,83
and promote the law of the jungle, where the strong prey on the weak

465
0:15:3,83 --> 0:15:4,53
and that got me thinking

466
0:15:4,53 --> 0:15:6,52
Why I had a few more interactions later

467
0:15:6,52 --> 0:15:7,42
and even some live calls

468
0:15:7,42 --> 0:15:10,2
After I tried to put myself in their shoes and see things from their perspective

469
0:15:10,2 --> 0:15:11,8
I got a rough idea

470
0:15:11,8 --> 0:15:12,2
about this psychological mechanism

471
0:15:12,2 --> 0:15:14,28
First, why is social media wrong

472
0:15:14,28 --> 0:15:17,1
A big reason is that there isn't just one path in this world, right

473
0:15:17,1 --> 0:15:18,48
We are not

474
0:15:18,48 --> 0:15:20,94
in fact, just competitors for a single resource

475
0:15:20,94 --> 0:15:23,52
So, modern people can meet their living conditions in various ways

476
0:15:23,52 --> 0:15:26,39
there are actually many ways to achieve satisfaction

477
0:15:26,39 --> 0:15:26,879
such as family affection

478
0:15:26,879 --> 0:15:27,199
romantic love

479
0:15:27,199 --> 0:15:27,979
friendship satisfaction

480
0:15:27,979 --> 0:15:28,919
romantic fulfillment

481
0:15:28,919 --> 0:15:29,979
career achievements

482
0:15:29,979 --> 0:15:31,79
self-expression

483
0:15:31,79 --> 0:15:32,65
The satisfaction of literature and arts, right?

484
0:15:32,65 --> 0:15:33,73
The satisfaction from sports

485
0:15:33,73 --> 0:15:36,33
But indeed, these satisfactions come with certain barriers

486
0:15:36,33 --> 0:15:36,99
I don't deny

487
0:15:36,99 --> 0:15:39,13
That they require support from parents and schools

488
0:15:39,13 --> 0:15:42,2
Provide a space for teenagers to explore and develop themselves

489
0:15:42,2 --> 0:15:45,34
And to put it bluntly, if you truly want to believe deep down

490
0:15:45,34 --> 0:15:46,62
That you are different from others

491
0:15:46,62 --> 0:15:47,82
That you have unique value

492
0:15:47,82 --> 0:15:50,42
You must know what you really like

493
0:15:50,42 --> 0:15:51,6
What are you good at?

494
0:15:51,6 --> 0:15:51,58
What do you love?

495
0:15:51,58 --> 0:15:52,76
You need to know who you are.

496
0:15:52,76 --> 0:15:53,78
Why are you different from others?

497
0:15:53,78 --> 0:15:55,26
And it doesn’t come out of nowhere.

498
0:15:55,26 --> 0:15:57,3
These things need to be developed from a young age.

499
0:15:57,3 --> 0:15:58,98
It doesn’t necessarily require a lot of money.

500
0:15:58,98 --> 0:16:1,8
In the internet era, developing a skill and a hobby

501
0:16:1,8 --> 0:16:3,18
Leads to a richer spiritual life.

502
0:16:3,18 --> 0:16:4,78
Or make some like-minded friends

503
0:16:4,78 --> 0:16:5,94
It really doesn’t have to cost much

504
0:16:5,94 --> 0:16:7,58
Like the students at Moon Forest

505
0:16:7,58 --> 0:16:9,26
Playing in a band can be quite expensive, though

506
0:16:9,26 --> 0:16:12,72
But if you buy a cheap guitar and write and play your own songs

507
0:16:12,72 --> 0:16:14,12
You won’t need much money

508
0:16:14,12 --> 0:16:15,6
At least you can play every day

509
0:16:15,6 --> 0:16:18,81
These Bilibili users usually come from families that can afford it

510
0:16:18,81 --> 0:16:20,3
So the main point is

511
0:16:20,3 --> 0:16:23,22
Families and schools need to provide such a space for teenagers

512
0:16:23,22 --> 0:16:25,3
and this is a luxury for many people

513
0:16:25,3 --> 0:16:26,62
because once you're past your teenage years

514
0:16:26,62 --> 0:16:27,51
and start earning money

515
0:16:27,51 --> 0:16:29,39
you might have the means to develop yourself later

516
0:16:29,39 --> 0:16:30,47
You have your Space

517
0:16:30,47 --> 0:16:31,53
and time to play

518
0:16:31,53 --> 0:16:33,43
by then, you might have become a hollow person

519
0:16:33,43 --> 0:16:34,3
and it will be too late

520
0:16:34,3 --> 0:16:36,78
At this point, if you haven't tried it

521
0:16:36,78 --> 0:16:40,29
it's true that there are all sorts of wonderful things in the world

522
0:16:40,29 --> 0:16:41,29
if you haven't seen them

523
0:16:41,29 --> 0:16:43,36
you might fall into a dog-eat-dog world

524
0:16:43,36 --> 0:16:45,4
I live in a world that's a spectator to a constant battlefield.

525
0:16:45,4 --> 0:16:47,1
because you don't know what else is out there

526
0:16:47,1 --> 0:16:47,96
What's next?

527
0:16:47,96 --> 0:16:48,68
Next is human nature

528
0:16:48,68 --> 0:16:50,14
the self-imposed limitations brought by human nature

529
0:16:50,14 --> 0:16:52,4
Because I've already gone through my own hardships

530
0:16:52,4 --> 0:16:55,4
If I were to acknowledge the value of diversity now

531
0:16:55,4 --> 0:16:56,56
Diverse lifestyles

532
0:16:56,56 --> 0:16:59,32
Then I would be no different from those who have been attending various hobby classes since childhood

533
0:16:59,32 --> 0:17:0,18
Pursuing their interests

534
0:17:0,18 --> 0:17:1,3
Watching plays

535
0:17:1,3 --> 0:17:2,4
Traveling around

536
0:17:2,4 --> 0:17:3,84
Playing tennis

537
0:17:3,84 --> 0:17:4,73
Going skating

538
0:17:4,73 --> 0:17:7,81
Compared to the kids of these middle-class and elite families

539
0:17:7,81 --> 0:17:9,49
I must be even more worthless

540
0:17:9,49 --> 0:17:11,3
I must be even more looked down upon

541
0:17:11,3 --> 0:17:12,699
Rather than being a clown

542
0:17:12,699 --> 0:17:13,959
I’d rather appear tough

543
0:17:13,959 --> 0:17:15,219
appear a bit cooler and calmer

544
0:17:15,219 --> 0:17:16,459
I’d rather say it in a cool way

545
0:17:16,459 --> 0:17:17,49
say it in a very dramatic way

546
0:17:17,49 --> 0:17:19,3
Society is a dog-eat-dog world

547
0:17:19,3 --> 0:17:21,99
Whether through speculation or through windfall profits

548
0:17:21,99 --> 0:17:25,629
I at least have the possibility of a comeback in my imagination, right?

549
0:17:25,629 --> 0:17:27,629
I can imagine myself becoming suddenly wealthy

550
0:17:27,629 --> 0:17:30,169
riding high above those who are now so arrogant

551
0:17:30,169 --> 0:17:31,49
giving them a taste of their own medicine

552
0:17:31,49 --> 0:17:31,269
See

553
0:17:31,269 --> 0:17:35,56
this kind of thinking has a dark beauty, like a long-suffering wife finally getting the upper hand

554
0:17:35,56 --> 0:17:37,33
the more I am bullied

555
0:17:37,33 --> 0:17:38,85
the more my thinking is limited

556
0:17:38,85 --> 0:17:40,77
It can only develop according to a single pattern

557
0:17:40,77 --> 0:17:42,23
until I can take advantage of others

558
0:17:42,23 --> 0:17:44,28
but it does align with human nature

559
0:17:44,28 --> 0:17:46,42
ultimately, this is also a result of cyclical changes

560
0:17:48,46 --> 0:17:51,2
this isn't unique to China

561
0:17:51,2 --> 0:17:52,94
the world is now entering a downturn

562
0:17:52,94 --> 0:17:54,66
almost all societies are moving to the right

563
0:17:54,66 --> 0:17:57,1
if we look back at the long river of history

564
0:17:57,1 --> 0:17:58,2
since modern times

565
0:17:58,2 --> 0:18:1,36
Throughout history, every time there's a downturn in growth rates,

566
0:18:1,36 --> 0:18:3,24
society tends to shift to the right,

567
0:18:3,24 --> 0:18:5,56
with a tendency towards conservatism.

568
0:18:5,56 --> 0:18:7,62
This shift often contains a considerable degree of rationality,

569
0:18:7,62 --> 0:18:9,42
because in such periods,

570
0:18:9,42 --> 0:18:10,86
risk-taking and openness

571
0:18:10,86 --> 0:18:14,68
don't provide the same benefits to ordinary people as they do during growth periods.

572
0:18:14,68 --> 0:18:15,7
Now, take a young person for example,

573
0:18:15,7 --> 0:18:17,4
I'm open-minded when it comes to gender views.

574
0:18:17,4 --> 0:18:18,42
I can't seem to find a partner either

575
0:18:18,42 --> 0:18:19,3
which means I can't get married, right?

576
0:18:19,3 --> 0:18:20,72
I have an open-minded approach to spending

577
0:18:20,72 --> 0:18:22,18
but I still can't afford premium goods

578
0:18:22,18 --> 0:18:23,24
so why should I be open-minded?

579
0:18:23,24 --> 0:18:24,24
I might as well be conservative

580
0:18:24,24 --> 0:18:27,92
That's why being conservative has become a collective aesthetic preference and lifestyle choice

581
0:18:27,92 --> 0:18:31,48
This is also from the video I posted in May of 2023.

582
0:18:34,9 --> 0:18:36,15
being right-wing on minor issues

583
0:18:36,15 --> 0:18:38,47
So, what I'm saying is actually in line with this matter.

584
0:18:38,47 --> 0:18:39,35
But what I want to say is,

585
0:18:39,35 --> 0:18:41,55
the underlying logic of an aesthetic preference is rational.

586
0:18:41,55 --> 0:18:43,27
it doesn't mean that the specific actions taken are always calm.

587
0:18:43,27 --> 0:18:45,34
Because sometimes people might, due to disgust and hatred,

588
0:18:45,34 --> 0:18:47,7
give up choices that are actually beneficial to themselves.

589
0:18:47,7 --> 0:18:49,48
We see many people now walking into dead ends, right?

590
0:18:49,48 --> 0:18:51,68
They can't find something that convinces them.

591
0:18:51,68 --> 0:18:54,34
They can't find something that convinces them.

592
0:18:54,34 --> 0:18:56,58
a collective narrative that people are willing to invest in

593
0:18:56,58 --> 0:18:58,56
along with the trend of personal growth

594
0:18:58,56 --> 0:19:0,22
it's also challenging to achieve in this era

595
0:19:0,22 --> 0:19:2,2
we've gone over this many times

596
0:19:2,2 --> 0:19:2,74
logically speaking

597
0:19:2,74 --> 0:19:4,1
this is the time to focus on yourself

598
0:19:4,1 --> 0:19:6,46
to find some affordable fun

599
0:19:6,46 --> 0:19:7,14
make some friends

600
0:19:7,14 --> 0:19:8,76
make life a bit easier, right

601
0:19:8,76 --> 0:19:10,88
This should clearly be a better choice.

602
0:19:10,88 --> 0:19:14,359
But some things that could broaden the horizons of life

603
0:19:14,359 --> 0:19:16,299
Make one more relaxed and happier

604
0:19:16,299 --> 0:19:18,959
And cost relatively less, are locked away by oneself.

605
0:19:18,959 --> 0:19:21,17
Many people think live houses are just noise.

606
0:19:21,17 --> 0:19:23,11
They believe bars are full of unsavory characters

607
0:19:23,11 --> 0:19:24,77
Who come to get drunk and flirt.

608
0:19:24,77 --> 0:19:25,71
They look down on these activities.

609
0:19:25,71 --> 0:19:28,36
They consider cycling and outdoor activities to be bourgeois.

610
0:19:28,36 --> 0:19:29,3
It's fake

611
0:19:29,3 --> 0:19:30,64
They don't truly love themselves

612
0:19:30,64 --> 0:19:31,74
They disdain even touching it

613
0:19:31,74 --> 0:19:34,15
Then, can't they at least have a relationship?

614
0:19:34,15 --> 0:19:34,67
No, they can't

615
0:19:34,67 --> 0:19:36,87
Why are they held back by so many things again?

616
0:19:36,87 --> 0:19:38,3
They wonder if they might be deceived

617
0:19:38,3 --> 0:19:40,1
If their feelings might be used to scam money

618
0:19:40,1 --> 0:19:41,55
Can it last a lifetime?

619
0:19:41,55 --> 0:19:43,87
Do you have the ability to take responsibility for the other person?

620
0:19:43,87 --> 0:19:44,87
Women get tired of men

621
0:19:44,87 --> 0:19:46,49
think men are all greasy and disgusting

622
0:19:46,49 --> 0:19:47,51
men are all tired of women

623
0:19:47,51 --> 0:19:49,5
think women are all materialistic and calculating

624
0:19:49,5 --> 0:19:50,83
both sides feel there are too few normal people

625
0:19:50,83 --> 0:19:51,69
can't even talk a bit

626
0:19:51,69 --> 0:19:52,67
then you watch a film

627
0:19:52,67 --> 0:19:53,87
watching literature works, right?

628
0:19:53,87 --> 0:19:54,39
It won't work either

629
0:19:54,39 --> 0:19:55,93
Because there are so many things with skewed values

630
0:19:55,93 --> 0:19:57,55
I have to guard against cultural infiltration

631
0:19:57,55 --> 0:19:59,96
I also have to watch out for the director and author slipping in their personal agendas

632
0:19:59,96 --> 0:20:1,34
In the end, it’s a big detour

633
0:20:1,34 --> 0:20:3,48
Trapped in life, unable to move

634
0:20:3,48 --> 0:20:4,34
Stuck in place

635
0:20:4,34 --> 0:20:5,32
I can only play some games

636
0:20:5,32 --> 0:20:6,9
Let's watch the video.

637
0:20:6,9 --> 0:20:7,91
Still, we watch with a critical eye

638
0:20:7,91 --> 0:20:8,73
Watch with a critical eye

639
0:20:8,73 --> 0:20:11,47
And often get quite upset by the plot or some award

640
0:20:11,47 --> 0:20:13,76
Easily falling into a new community of shared resentment

641
0:20:13,76 --> 0:20:15,78
This is the current state of young people today

642
0:20:15,78 --> 0:20:17,7
Feeling a bit boxed in from all sides

643
0:20:17,7 --> 0:20:21,56
Such individuals find themselves stuck between life and their own beliefs

644
0:20:21,56 --> 0:20:22,84
From a broader perspective

645
0:20:22,84 --> 0:20:25,44
It reflects the overall society we are in

646
0:20:25,44 --> 0:20:26,6
It's neither up nor down

647
0:20:26,6 --> 0:20:27,54
It's stuck in the middle

648
0:20:27,54 --> 0:20:28,68
If we're being rational

649
0:20:28,68 --> 0:20:29,6
everyone can understand

650
0:20:29,6 --> 0:20:32,73
from a long-term societal perspective

651
0:20:32,73 --> 0:20:34,89
it's hard for a society to have it all, right?

652
0:20:34,89 --> 0:20:38,21
it's difficult to achieve rapid growth

653
0:20:39,57 --> 0:20:40,95
without environmental damage

654
0:20:40,95 --> 0:20:42,1
and maintain high social mobility

655
0:20:42,1 --> 0:20:43,24
The benefits are also high

656
0:20:43,24 --> 0:20:45,18
This applies to any country

657
0:20:46,86 --> 0:20:48,2
However, the awkward part is

658
0:20:48,2 --> 0:20:50,2
We might now be in a somewhat opposite situation

659
0:20:50,2 --> 0:20:52,14
The costs that should have been paid have already been incurred

660
0:20:52,14 --> 0:20:55,18
And due to inertia, these costs will continue

661
0:20:55,18 --> 0:20:57,74
Or this cost has been passed on to the younger generation.

662
0:20:57,74 --> 0:21:0,7
But the benefits haven't arrived yet

663
0:21:0,7 --> 0:21:2,47
For instance, it hasn't reached a high-welfare state yet

664
0:21:2,47 --> 0:21:3,63
Liquidity has already decreased

665
0:21:3,63 --> 0:21:5,12
Infrastructure investment is still increasing

666
0:21:5,12 --> 0:21:6,76
The era of major maintenance has arrived

667
0:21:6,76 --> 0:21:8,0
Hard technology is still catching up

668
0:21:8,0 --> 0:21:9,389
We are still in the process of industrial structure transformation

669
0:21:11,109 --> 0:21:12,369
County towns and new rural areas

670
0:21:12,369 --> 0:21:13,82
The construction of new rural areas hasn't been around for long

671
0:21:13,82 --> 0:21:16,1
The unique financial industry found in big cities

672
0:21:16,1 --> 0:21:17,52
Internet companies are no longer hiring

673
0:21:17,52 --> 0:21:19,72
including the lifestyle of the middle class

674
0:21:19,72 --> 0:21:22,459
the middle-class culture has yet to be established

675
0:21:22,459 --> 0:21:24,68
the middle-class is almost disappearing

676
0:21:24,68 --> 0:21:27,2
do you think these issues will eventually be resolved

677
0:21:27,2 --> 0:21:28,42
I believe they will

678
0:21:28,42 --> 0:21:29,9
history always progresses in a spiral

679
0:21:29,9 --> 0:21:32,54
but the problem is that changes over the past few years have been too rapid

680
0:21:32,54 --> 0:21:33,38
imagine for a moment

681
0:21:33,38 --> 0:21:34,56
if you were born in 2000

682
0:21:34,56 --> 0:21:35,78
When you first started college

683
0:21:35,78 --> 0:21:37,94
it seemed like housing prices would keep soaring indefinitely

684
0:21:37,94 --> 0:21:39,54
and the old Chinese stocks were still overheated

685
0:21:39,54 --> 0:21:42,2
young people were still taking out online loans

686
0:21:42,2 --> 0:21:43,14
and spending in advance

687
0:21:43,14 --> 0:21:45,22
but by the time you graduated, no one was starting businesses anymore

688
0:21:45,22 --> 0:21:47,98
everyone was thinking about living a FIRE life in third- or fourth-tier cities

689
0:21:47,98 --> 0:21:49,46
this rapid shift

690
0:21:49,46 --> 0:21:52,14
has imposed a cost that should have been spread over generations

691
0:21:52,14 --> 0:21:53,88
There's also this ideological shift that needs to be digested

692
0:21:53,88 --> 0:21:55,98
Let a generation focus on consuming it.

693
0:21:55,98 --> 0:21:59,24
This is what the post-00s and post-05s face

694
0:21:59,24 --> 0:22:2,52
Including perhaps some of the post-95s who are enchanted by the magical UI

695
0:22:2,52 --> 0:22:3,64
A reality that hits without warning

696
0:22:3,64 --> 0:22:6,4
When we delve deeper into this

697
0:22:6,4 --> 0:22:8,4
The multi-faceted nature of the physical world and real life

698
0:22:8,4 --> 0:22:10,92
It is also reflected in ideology or mental outlook.

699
0:22:10,92 --> 0:22:14,8
It embodies something quite peculiar and unique.

700
0:22:14,8 --> 0:22:18,44
I often feel that the new generation is wearing the skin of pre-modernity.

701
0:22:18,44 --> 0:22:21,94
while using a postmodern core to counter modernity, which might be hard to grasp

702
0:22:21,94 --> 0:22:24,98
it's like everyone is engaging in this weird and wacky spiritual cosplay

703
0:22:24,98 --> 0:22:27,7
this kind of differentiated self-actualization

704
0:22:27,7 --> 0:22:28,56
personal narrative

705
0:22:28,56 --> 0:22:29,56
seems great

706
0:22:29,56 --> 0:22:31,8
but it requires an economic foundation

707
0:22:31,8 --> 0:22:34,56
it needs a certain level of inner inclusiveness and openness

708
0:22:34,56 --> 0:22:35,4
and the same goes for society

709
0:22:35,4 --> 0:22:38,4
It requires a certain level of aesthetic and knowledge.

710
0:22:38,4 --> 0:22:39,46
So for young people,

711
0:22:39,46 --> 0:22:41,56
He might seem like a Moon in the Water.

712
0:22:41,56 --> 0:22:44,29
Thus, another way to make oneself feel better

713
0:22:44,29 --> 0:22:45,81
is to deconstruct modern life.

714
0:22:45,81 --> 0:22:46,75
Since I can't have it,

715
0:22:46,75 --> 0:22:48,49
I use various methods to convince myself

716
0:22:48,49 --> 0:22:49,49
that I don't want it.

717
0:22:49,49 --> 0:22:52,53
Therefore, some people choose to retreat back to

718
0:22:52,53 --> 0:22:54,37
Pre-modern moral norms

719
0:22:54,37 --> 0:22:56,11
including those traditional norms

720
0:22:56,11 --> 0:22:59,71
criticize the hypocrisy and emptiness of modern life

721
0:22:59,71 --> 0:23:0,949
people lack the virtues of the past

722
0:23:0,949 --> 0:23:1,969
social morals are declining

723
0:23:1,969 --> 0:23:3,469
critiques of modern life

724
0:23:3,469 --> 0:23:6,369
some criticisms of modern society may hold true

725
0:23:6,369 --> 0:23:8,78
but ultimately, it's a form of cosplay

726
0:23:8,78 --> 0:23:9,8
for contemporary youth

727
0:23:9,8 --> 0:23:10,78
I'll be blunt.

728
0:23:10,78 --> 0:23:12,76
I absolutely don’t want to go back to the pre-modern era.

729
0:23:12,76 --> 0:23:15,34
Whether it’s the arranged marriages in personal relationships,

730
0:23:18,2 --> 0:23:19,2
or the uniform distribution,

731
0:23:19,2 --> 0:23:21,44
or the cultural and aesthetic uniformity,

732
0:23:21,44 --> 0:23:23,18
if these were to really happen,

733
0:23:23,18 --> 0:23:24,5
no one could endure it.

734
0:23:24,5 --> 0:23:27,67
So behind the anger of the new generation

735
0:23:27,67 --> 0:23:29,57
what we see is frustration and disappointment.

736
0:23:29,57 --> 0:23:32,23
Behind their aggressive words lies a sense of self-defense.

737
0:23:32,23 --> 0:23:36,59
This then forms a kind of large-scale, collective avoidance.

738
0:23:36,59 --> 0:23:37,95
Let's talk about attachment styles here.

739
0:23:37,95 --> 0:23:41,35
I feel that I've shared most of what I've observed over the past two years.

740
0:23:41,35 --> 0:23:45,2
I've pretty much described and analyzed the prevailing mental state of our times.

741
0:23:45,2 --> 0:23:46,72
This is something I've really wanted to do.

742
0:23:46,72 --> 0:23:49,28
I'm taking the opportunity of the year-end review in 2024,

743
0:23:49,28 --> 0:23:53,0
I'd like to share some of my thoughts with you all seriously.

744
0:23:53,0 --> 0:23:54,2
and some of my thoughts

745
0:23:54,2 --> 0:23:55,74
This process was quite challenging.

746
0:23:55,74 --> 0:23:57,64
Writing the script also took a considerable amount of time.

747
0:23:57,64 --> 0:23:59,53
Because the topics we discussed were quite broad.

748
0:23:59,53 --> 0:24:1,57
I can only share my perspective from the corner of the world I've seen.

749
0:24:1,57 --> 0:24:3,8
And perhaps in a rather limited way.

750
0:24:3,8 --> 0:24:5,5
I'll try to elaborate on my personal understanding and descriptions.

751
0:24:5,5 --> 0:24:6,54
Theoretically speaking,

752
0:24:6,54 --> 0:24:8,52
After describing the phenomena and analyzing the causes,

753
0:24:8,52 --> 0:24:11,72
we should then predict trends or propose solutions.

754
0:24:11,72 --> 0:24:14,36
It formed a great self-media article

755
0:24:14,36 --> 0:24:16,6
But I found myself struggling with it for a long time

756
0:24:16,6 --> 0:24:18,83
That’s why this episode was also delayed for so long before being released

757
0:24:18,83 --> 0:24:19,93
I realized I couldn’t do it

758
0:24:19,93 --> 0:24:21,59
Because various issues were all converging at this moment

759
0:24:21,59 --> 0:24:24,2
At this particular juncture, they intertwined

760
0:24:24,2 --> 0:24:24,98
It became a mess

761
0:24:24,98 --> 0:24:26,86
Trying to make sense of it was already a challenge

762
0:24:26,86 --> 0:24:28,98
Let alone coming up with any reliable answers

763
0:24:28,98 --> 0:24:29,96
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

764
0:24:29,96 --> 0:24:32,54
I'll provide it for you at the end of the video.

765
0:24:32,54 --> 0:24:34,42
A preliminary step to solve the problem.

766
0:24:34,42 --> 0:24:35,64
The idea is to provide such a perspective.

767
0:24:35,64 --> 0:24:36,7
It's about depersonalizing responsibility.

768
0:24:36,7 --> 0:24:37,58
Just think about it.

769
0:24:37,58 --> 0:24:40,63
Clocking in and out on time at any workplace in the world,

770
0:24:40,63 --> 0:24:41,41
Working diligently,

771
0:24:41,41 --> 0:24:42,19
Supporting one's parents.

772
0:24:42,19 --> 0:24:43,1
Those who abide by the law

773
0:24:43,1 --> 0:24:43,79
and pay their taxes

774
0:24:43,79 --> 0:24:46,56
can be regarded as the pillars of society

775
0:24:46,56 --> 0:24:48,46
and can enjoy life with a clear conscience

776
0:24:48,46 --> 0:24:49,36
but in our case

777
0:24:49,36 --> 0:24:50,3
this is what we call lying flat

778
0:24:50,3 --> 0:24:51,28
if you think about it carefully

779
0:24:51,28 --> 0:24:53,2
this is a seriously distorted situation

780
0:24:53,2 --> 0:24:54,98
what is the truly reasonable approach

781
0:24:54,98 --> 0:24:56,26
In such a situation

782
0:24:56,26 --> 0:24:59,92
if we can't get what we want the most

783
0:24:59,92 --> 0:25:2,74
we might as well lighten our load a bit

784
0:25:2,74 --> 0:25:3,62
and it will feel better

785
0:25:3,62 --> 0:25:7,46
Contemporary young people are generally under intense pressure, like being in a pressure cooker.

786
0:25:7,46 --> 0:25:8,62
if you add more pressure

787
0:25:8,62 --> 0:25:12,56
it will only lead to a systemic mental breakdown

788
0:25:12,56 --> 0:25:14,58
in recent years, it has become somewhat like Japan

789
0:25:14,58 --> 0:25:17,1
showing signs of a low-desire society from the past two decades

790
0:25:17,1 --> 0:25:18,24
The path is very similar

791
0:25:18,24 --> 0:25:20,94
Japan experienced a sharp decline in growth rates

792
0:25:20,94 --> 0:25:23,32
Then the benefits for young people drastically decreased

793
0:25:23,32 --> 0:25:24,54
But the pressure hasn't eased up

794
0:25:24,54 --> 0:25:26,94
So individuals can only disconnect from society

795
0:25:26,94 --> 0:25:28,22
To maintain inner peace

796
0:25:28,22 --> 0:25:30,29
This generation of Japanese people

797
0:25:30,29 --> 0:25:31,97
Several generations of Japanese have not been consuming

798
0:25:31,97 --> 0:25:32,45
Not socializing

799
0:25:32,45 --> 0:25:33,9
No dating

800
0:25:33,9 --> 0:25:33,84
No having children

801
0:25:33,84 --> 0:25:34,44
Nonviolence

802
0:25:34,44 --> 0:25:35,44
Not cooperating, right?

803
0:25:35,44 --> 0:25:37,48
This is the spirit of the Heisei generation

804
0:25:37,48 --> 0:25:38,92
The mental state and behavioral logic

805
0:25:38,92 --> 0:25:39,64
It's like that

806
0:25:39,64 --> 0:25:41,36
So Japan has actually already demonstrated

807
0:25:41,36 --> 0:25:44,19
Society doesn't actively exempt this generation from responsibility.

808
0:25:44,19 --> 0:25:46,55
Then this generation will spontaneously accomplish this step.

809
0:25:46,55 --> 0:25:47,75
And they will do so more resolutely.

810
0:25:47,75 --> 0:25:49,63
So I believe that families and society,

811
0:25:49,63 --> 0:25:50,84
schools and businesses,

812
0:25:50,84 --> 0:25:51,94
including the content industry,

813
0:25:51,94 --> 0:25:54,7
should gradually and broadly change,

814
0:25:54,7 --> 0:25:57,4
This mainstream public opinion environment and emotional atmosphere

815
0:25:57,4 --> 0:25:59,4
with less extreme positivity being instilled,

816
0:25:59,4 --> 0:26:1,82
and less anxiety about urgency being promoted.

817
0:26:1,82 --> 0:26:3,24
Less emphasis on fostering hatred

818
0:26:3,24 --> 0:26:4,12
What everyone can see

819
0:26:4,12 --> 0:26:4,94
What everyone can hear

820
0:26:4,94 --> 0:26:6,4
Starting from elementary school

821
0:26:6,4 --> 0:26:7,98
Every year of life is crucial

822
0:26:7,98 --> 0:26:9,54
Fifth grade is the most critical

823
0:26:9,54 --> 0:26:10,4
Sixth grade is the most important

824
0:26:10,4 --> 0:26:11,46
Seventh grade is key, and eighth grade is crucial

825
0:26:11,46 --> 0:26:12,1
Freshman year is pivotal

826
0:26:12,1 --> 0:26:12,82
The crucial third year

827
0:26:12,82 --> 0:26:13,66
The critical internship

828
0:26:13,66 --> 0:26:15,98
Each year is pivotal in your career

829
0:26:15,98 --> 0:26:18,5
There's no need to be constantly on edge throughout each year

830
0:26:21,86 --> 0:26:24,86
There's an important prerequisite for this

831
0:26:24,86 --> 0:26:27,8
It's about legitimizing showbiz

832
0:26:27,8 --> 0:26:28,88
From ancient times to the present

833
0:26:28,88 --> 0:26:31,4
We have always placed great emphasis on meaning

834
0:26:31,4 --> 0:26:32,26
And on light entertainment

835
0:26:32,26 --> 0:26:34,1
It's not even about belittling showbiz

836
0:26:34,1 --> 0:26:36,42
but rather restricting and being wary of it

837
0:26:36,42 --> 0:26:38,5
I always feel like if everyone just lets loose and has fun

838
0:26:38,5 --> 0:26:39,42
things will get out of hand

839
0:26:39,42 --> 0:26:40,26
and joy will turn to sorrow

840
0:26:40,26 --> 0:26:41,49
and indulgence will lead to the loss of one's purpose

841
0:26:41,49 --> 0:26:42,99
The Disintegration of Ritual and Music will occur

842
0:26:42,99 --> 0:26:45,969
I think it's time to change this mindset

843
0:26:45,969 --> 0:26:48,609
the modern entertainment industry is not just about

844
0:26:48,609 --> 0:26:51,1
Shaping values and spreading positive energy

845
0:26:51,1 --> 0:26:52,66
It is also crucial

846
0:26:52,66 --> 0:26:54,7
A societal pressure valve and stabilizer

847
0:26:54,7 --> 0:26:56,12
I truly believe this

848
0:26:56,12 --> 0:26:59,75
Even mindless, low-quality joy and relaxation

849
0:26:59,75 --> 0:27:2,9
Is better than anxiety, hatred, and mutual attacks

850
0:27:2,9 --> 0:27:4,14
And self-deprecation

851
0:27:4,14 --> 0:27:5,18
These things are worse

852
0:27:5,18 --> 0:27:7,2
Of course, we don’t need to be like South Korea

853
0:27:7,2 --> 0:27:7,84
Cultural entertainment as a national pillar

854
0:27:7,84 --> 0:27:8,8
That's not necessary

855
0:27:8,8 --> 0:27:10,62
But it can certainly justify the entertainment industry

856
0:27:10,62 --> 0:27:11,44
With algorithms

857
0:27:11,44 --> 0:27:13,24
Regulation can reduce some of the hate

858
0:27:13,24 --> 0:27:14,8
And lessen the adversarial nature

859
0:27:14,8 --> 0:27:18,64
Then provide a lot more high-quality entertainment products

860
0:27:18,64 --> 0:27:22,1
Because on the surface, it seems that there's an oversupply of content in Simplified Chinese

861
0:27:22,1 --> 0:27:23,98
But this illusion hides what's truly engaging

862
0:27:23,98 --> 0:27:24,46
It sounds good

863
0:27:24,46 --> 0:27:24,9
It looks good

864
0:27:24,9 --> 0:27:25,54
but not vulgar

865
0:27:25,54 --> 0:27:26,48
and not flat

866
0:27:26,48 --> 0:27:29,52
There's too little content with esthetic value and practical significance.

867
0:27:29,52 --> 0:27:32,2
To put it bluntly, there are too few productions like Black Myth: The Long Season

868
0:27:32,2 --> 0:27:35,82
Going a step further, even fewer works like Film Hurricane and Uncle Bing

869
0:27:35,82 --> 0:27:38,38
So we should vigorously develop the cultural and entertainment industry

870
0:27:38,38 --> 0:27:41,14
On a personal micro level, we also need to promote a culture of quality

871
0:27:41,14 --> 0:27:42,46
And this step might be even harder

872
0:27:42,46 --> 0:27:44,6
because after prolonged PUA

873
0:27:44,6 --> 0:27:46,26
sometimes even when external pressure is gone

874
0:27:46,26 --> 0:27:48,66
one still needs to put some pressure on oneself

875
0:27:48,66 --> 0:27:49,62
or it feels uncomfortable all over

876
0:27:49,62 --> 0:27:50,5
This is a kind of inertia

877
0:27:50,5 --> 0:27:51,58
On the surface

878
0:27:51,58 --> 0:27:53,63
it seems that many young people are now waking up

879
0:27:53,63 --> 0:27:55,43
taking the initiative to reduce their responsibilities

880
0:27:55,43 --> 0:27:56,91
However, my observation is

881
0:27:56,91 --> 0:27:58,57
that deep down

882
0:27:58,57 --> 0:28:1,12
many people still see this as a form of rebellion, a way to overturn the table

883
0:28:1,12 --> 0:28:3,12
they still hope I'll overturn the table

884
0:28:3,12 --> 0:28:4,24
Huiwen stops me

885
0:28:4,24 --> 0:28:5,4
and gives me some fatherly love

886
0:28:5,4 --> 0:28:7,98
but those who can truly stand up for themselves

887
0:28:7,98 --> 0:28:10,57
and openly take responsibility are few

888
0:28:10,57 --> 0:28:13,91
like the girl who loves cats that Vans mentioned before, right

889
0:28:13,91 --> 0:28:17,24
Often mocked by young so-called new males against feminists

890
0:28:17,24 --> 0:28:18,16
But if you think about it carefully

891
0:28:18,16 --> 0:28:20,14
What's the real issue with being childless and loving cats?

892
0:28:20,14 --> 0:28:21,92
The men who make such mocking remarks

893
0:28:21,92 --> 0:28:24,32
Many of them are also cat lovers, right?

894
0:28:27,2 --> 0:28:28,42
One shouldn’t choose a woman who loves cats without flowers

895
0:28:28,42 --> 0:28:29,58
Instead of being an ordinary person

896
0:28:29,58 --> 0:28:30,5
Loving harmless cats, is that wrong?

897
0:28:30,5 --> 0:28:33,7
This is what I call the half-covered responsibility avoidance

898
0:28:33,7 --> 0:28:35,7
Treating the abdication of responsibility as a tool

899
0:28:35,7 --> 0:28:38,54
rather than genuinely accepting one's own responsibility

900
0:28:38,54 --> 0:28:41,18
Many people feel the pressure is just too overwhelming

901
0:28:41,18 --> 0:28:42,6
My mental state has completely fallen apart

902
0:28:42,6 --> 0:28:43,28
but on the other hand

903
0:28:43,28 --> 0:28:46,12
the lingering effects of previous emotional manipulation still echo in their minds

904
0:28:46,12 --> 0:28:46,9
the aftereffects are still present

905
0:28:46,9 --> 0:28:48,66
they can't bring themselves to accept who they are

906
0:28:48,66 --> 0:28:49,76
to truly accept themselves

907
0:28:49,76 --> 0:28:50,56
To de-responsibilize

908
0:28:50,56 --> 0:28:51,26
Accepting oneself

909
0:28:51,26 --> 0:28:52,64
Keep those things out

910
0:28:52,64 --> 0:28:54,18
So in terms of behavior

911
0:28:54,18 --> 0:28:56,62
The language becomes very twisted and awkward

912
0:28:56,62 --> 0:28:58,7
They think one thing but curse at the same time

913
0:28:58,7 --> 0:29:1,56
This is what I referred to as a grand exhibition of avoidant attachment

914
0:29:1,56 --> 0:29:4,2
So I feel that one thing we can do

915
0:29:4,2 --> 0:29:6,8
Is to work on separating various issues

916
0:29:6,8 --> 0:29:7,99
Separate marriage from romantic relationships

917
0:29:7,99 --> 0:29:9,87
Separate childbearing from marriage

918
0:29:9,87 --> 0:29:12,78
Separate personal growth from the gains and losses of the company

919
0:29:12,78 --> 0:29:14,88
Separate power and status from dignity

920
0:29:14,88 --> 0:29:18,2
Separate the fun times with friends from long-term companionship

921
0:29:18,2 --> 0:29:19,5
Even in extreme cases

922
0:29:19,5 --> 0:29:21,64
If the family of origin is truly terrible

923
0:29:21,64 --> 0:29:24,8
I think for some people

924
0:29:24,8 --> 0:29:26,68
It’s possible to separate financial support from emotional connection

925
0:29:26,68 --> 0:29:28,78
Doing this seems to come with all sorts of issues.

926
0:29:28,78 --> 0:29:30,38
Because from a mature perspective,

927
0:29:30,38 --> 0:29:32,36
it's impossible to avoid responsibility for a lifetime, right?

928
0:29:32,36 --> 0:29:32,94
No problem.

929
0:29:32,94 --> 0:29:34,16
You definitely have to take on some responsibilities.

930
0:29:34,16 --> 0:29:35,72
And from a societal standpoint,

931
0:29:35,72 --> 0:29:36,68
if you don't take responsibility,

932
0:29:36,68 --> 0:29:38,8
someone else will have to step up.

933
0:29:38,8 --> 0:29:40,32
For example, if no one chooses to have children,

934
0:29:40,32 --> 0:29:42,36
Overall, we will face a significant population issue.

935
0:29:42,36 --> 0:29:43,18
There needs to be someone to take on the role.

936
0:29:43,18 --> 0:29:44,36
However, even so,

937
0:29:44,36 --> 0:29:47,3
I still firmly believe in the need to reduce responsibility.

938
0:29:47,3 --> 0:29:47,67
Why?

939
0:29:47,67 --> 0:29:49,23
Because from an individual's perspective,

940
0:29:49,23 --> 0:29:50,99
A person's mental space is limited.

941
0:29:50,99 --> 0:29:51,75
A person's inner world,

942
0:29:51,75 --> 0:29:53,74
if overwhelmed by anxiety and stress,

943
0:29:53,74 --> 0:29:55,5
Responsibility has completely taken over

944
0:29:55,5 --> 0:29:56,38
If it’s fully occupied

945
0:29:56,38 --> 0:29:59,2
he is actually in a state of internal depletion

946
0:29:59,2 --> 0:30:1,6
his psychological resilience will be very low

947
0:30:1,6 --> 0:30:2,5
his state will become very numb

948
0:30:2,5 --> 0:30:4,18
I’ve noticed in recent years

949
0:30:4,18 --> 0:30:5,66
many people appear calm on the surface

950
0:30:5,66 --> 0:30:7,38
but inside they’re like pressure cookers

951
0:30:7,38 --> 0:30:8,26
As I mentioned earlier

952
0:30:8,26 --> 0:30:9,14
I looked up a piece of data

953
0:30:9,14 --> 0:30:11,52
an authoritative statistic published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022

954
0:30:11,52 --> 0:30:12,28
the authoritative report

955
0:30:12,28 --> 0:30:14,8
indicated the detection rates for depression and anxiety among college students

956
0:30:14,8 --> 0:30:16,36
were 21.48%

957
0:30:16,36 --> 0:30:17,6
and 45.28%, respectively

958
0:30:17,6 --> 0:30:20,44
with an average prevalence of mental disorders at 22.8%

959
0:30:20,44 --> 0:30:21,76
which is already quite high

960
0:30:21,76 --> 0:30:23,4
but now, two years later

961
0:30:23,4 --> 0:30:25,8
I reckon he might grow even taller

962
0:30:25,8 --> 0:30:26,12
In this state

963
0:30:26,12 --> 0:30:27,6
it's hard for a person to develop

964
0:30:27,6 --> 0:30:30,4
even if you feel pressured by external factors and moral standards

965
0:30:30,4 --> 0:30:31,6
to take responsibility

966
0:30:31,6 --> 0:30:33,24
you lack the mental capacity to do so

967
0:30:33,24 --> 0:30:35,0
so it's necessary to first relieve the burden of responsibility

968
0:30:35,0 --> 0:30:36,52
and restore your sense of self-worth

969
0:30:36,52 --> 0:30:38,34
and regain a sense of self-sufficiency

970
0:30:38,34 --> 0:30:40,6
A relaxed mental state and vitality

971
0:30:40,6 --> 0:30:44,82
This allows us to create mental space to embrace responsibility and truly take it on.

972
0:30:44,82 --> 0:30:47,26
You have the space to do such things

973
0:30:47,26 --> 0:30:49,92
So this is my answer that isn't quite an answer

974
0:30:49,92 --> 0:30:53,0
If you can find a job

975
0:30:53,0 --> 0:30:56,14
that provides a basic guarantee for your personal survival

976
0:30:56,14 --> 0:30:57,52
And fortunately

977
0:30:57,52 --> 0:30:58,72
for various reasons

978
0:30:58,72 --> 0:31:0,6
you have something you like and are passionate about

979
0:31:0,6 --> 0:31:1,62
even if it's a bit vague

980
0:31:1,62 --> 0:31:2,78
In such a situation

981
0:31:2,78 --> 0:31:5,62
you can explore different practices to find your own

982
0:31:5,62 --> 0:31:7,76
better solution that I mentioned earlier

983
0:31:7,76 --> 0:31:10,42
which is a differentiated self-actualization narrative

984
0:31:10,42 --> 0:31:12,19
Another scenario is

985
0:31:12,19 --> 0:31:14,19
if your current situation is difficult

986
0:31:14,19 --> 0:31:15,89
and you can't find this personal narrative

987
0:31:15,89 --> 0:31:18,7
I suggest you don't put additional pressure on yourself

988
0:31:18,7 --> 0:31:20,82
Get rid of the clutter in your mind

989
0:31:20,82 --> 0:31:21,26
the external pressures

990
0:31:21,26 --> 0:31:22,78
imposed on you

991
0:31:22,78 --> 0:31:24,84
by others

992
0:31:24,84 --> 0:31:26,34
Including, if necessary

993
0:31:26,34 --> 0:31:27,8
cutting off toxic relationships

994
0:31:27,8 --> 0:31:29,6
It's worth it

995
0:31:29,6 --> 0:31:30,32
Focus less on

996
0:31:30,32 --> 0:31:32,56
Follow the grand and distant things

997
0:31:32,56 --> 0:31:34,23
Stop blaming yourself

998
0:31:34,23 --> 0:31:36,51
Stop attacking others and venting righteous anger

999
0:31:36,51 --> 0:31:38,11
These things won't bring you happiness

1000
0:31:38,11 --> 0:31:39,89
It doesn't bring about Mental Spaces

1001
0:31:39,89 --> 0:31:41,21
or add value

1002
0:31:41,21 --> 0:31:43,72
First, focus on your immediate environment

1003
0:31:43,72 --> 0:31:45,22
handle specific tasks

1004
0:31:45,22 --> 0:31:47,16
improve your living conditions

1005
0:31:47,16 --> 0:31:49,72
get rid of the burdens and responsibilities on your shoulders

1006
0:31:49,72 --> 0:31:52,38
then see if you can find something else

1007
0:31:52,38 --> 0:31:54,88
This is all I can offer

1008
0:31:54,88 --> 0:31:57,42
It might be considered a barely acceptable answer.

1009
0:31:57,42 --> 0:31:59,4
I think it's hard to fight against the tide of the times

1010
0:31:59,4 --> 0:32:2,45
The video's conclusion, however, isn't particularly optimistic.

1011
0:32:2,45 --> 0:32:4,9
I'll talk about something that left a deep impression on me

1012
0:32:4,9 --> 0:32:6,42
something that made me happy

1013
0:32:6,42 --> 0:32:7,22
At the beginning of 2021

1014
0:32:7,22 --> 0:32:10,73
I was invited to attend a closed-door event for Thirteen Yao

1015
0:32:10,73 --> 0:32:12,29
Those familiar with me might know

1016
0:32:12,29 --> 0:32:15,739
Thirteen Yao is a dialogue program I've always loved

1017
0:32:15,739 --> 0:32:17,119
At the event

1018
0:32:17,119 --> 0:32:19,19
I met the production team of Thirteen Yao

1019
0:32:19,19 --> 0:32:19,919
I met Zhiyuan Xu

1020
0:32:19,919 --> 0:32:22,679
Then Zhiyuan Xu, as rumored, had a drink

1021
0:32:22,679 --> 0:32:23,599
his face turned red

1022
0:32:23,599 --> 0:32:26,51
Then we, more than ten people

1023
0:32:26,51 --> 0:32:27,29
including media representatives

1024
0:32:27,29 --> 0:32:28,31
bloggers

1025
0:32:28,31 --> 0:32:30,83
had a chat with Zhiyuan Xu

1026
0:32:30,83 --> 0:32:32,31
and the Thirteen Yao production team

1027
0:32:32,31 --> 0:32:34,53
sitting in a circle

1028
0:32:34,53 --> 0:32:36,45
Zhiyuan Xu said

1029
0:32:36,45 --> 0:32:38,8
why the world needs culture

1030
0:32:38,8 --> 0:32:39,76
art, and philosophy

1031
0:32:39,76 --> 0:32:41,18
why we need a humanistic spirit

1032
0:32:41,18 --> 0:32:43,28
Because in the spiritual world

1033
0:32:43,28 --> 0:32:45,8
in the realm of humanities, there are many paths

1034
0:32:45,8 --> 0:32:47,6
so people don't have to

1035
0:32:47,6 --> 0:32:49,78
squeeze onto the same narrow path

1036
0:32:49,78 --> 0:32:51,12
push each other aside

1037
0:32:51,12 --> 0:32:52,14
pull each other back

1038
0:32:52,14 --> 0:32:52,92
There's no need to run and fight on that narrow path

1039
0:32:52,92 --> 0:32:55,64
This statement left a deep impression on me

1040
0:32:55,64 --> 0:32:57,26
I've remembered it for years

1041
0:32:57,26 --> 0:32:58,34
At the time, I was in a particularly unique phase of my personal life

1042
0:32:58,34 --> 0:33:1,28
His words provided me with significant mental comfort

1043
0:33:1,28 --> 0:33:3,48
I'm also sending this to you, the viewers, at the end of 2024

1044
0:33:3,48 --> 0:33:7,62
So, by the end of 2024, we'll also be sending this to all of you who watch the videos.

1045
0:33:7,62 --> 0:33:10,7
That's about it for this video

1046
0:33:10,7 --> 0:33:12,71
That's about it for this video.

1047
0:33:12,71 --> 0:33:13,51
in my New Year's message video in 2023, I said

1048
0:33:13,51 --> 0:33:16,47
In my New Year's message video in 2023, I said

1049
0:33:30,83 --> 0:33:32,45
It will be live on New Year's Eve night.

1050
0:33:39,24 --> 0:33:41,62
So, I've reflected on the past two videos as well.

1051
0:33:50,66 --> 0:33:51,94
A lot of room for improvement

1052
0:34:4,29 --> 0:34:7,61
Enjoys sharing various perspectives and insights about oneself

1053
0:34:7,61 --> 0:34:11,9
an UPloader who shares ideas, observations, and thoughts

1054
0:34:11,9 --> 0:34:13,13
See you in the next video.
