0:0:1,66 --> 0:0:2,2
Hello everyone

2
0:0:2,2 --> 0:0:2,76
I'm Lao Jiang

3
0:0:2,76 --> 0:0:5,3
Today is the first day of 2025

4
0:0:5,3 --> 0:0:6,9
Happy New Year to all of you

5
0:0:6,9 --> 0:0:10,4
So, this video is an end-of-year observation for 2024.

6
0:0:10,4 --> 0:0:12,38
It will be divided into two parts

7
0:0:12,38 --> 0:0:15,17
The first part mainly highlights the phenomena

8
0:0:15,17 --> 0:0:15,99
It only presents observations

9
0:0:17,7 --> 0:0:23,25
So this video is about my reflections on the past year.

10
0:0:23,25 --> 0:0:25,41
Because I believe 2024 is a pivotal year.

11
0:0:25,41 --> 0:0:28,21
It has seen many iconic symbols.

12
0:0:28,21 --> 0:0:29,75
A world full of meaning.

13
0:0:29,75 --> 0:0:33,42
I tried to connect them with a thread.

14
0:0:33,42 --> 0:0:36,87
Everything I observed and thought about throughout the year.

15
0:0:36,87 --> 0:0:38,79
Then I put it together.

16
0:0:38,79 --> 0:0:41,55
I'll share my observations and thoughts with everyone

17
0:0:41,79 --> 0:0:42,83
As for 2024,

18
0:0:42,83 --> 0:0:43,99
If I had to pick just one

19
0:0:43,99 --> 0:0:46,63
The event that best represents social trends and sentiments

20
0:0:46,63 --> 0:0:48,59
What would everyone choose?

21
0:0:48,59 --> 0:0:50,57
I would choose the Zhengzhou night ride.

22
0:0:50,93 --> 0:0:51,93
On one evening,

23
0:0:51,93 --> 0:0:53,89
nearly 200,000 college students

24
0:0:53,89 --> 0:0:56,39
spontaneously embarked on a carnival-style bike ride.

25
0:0:56,39 --> 0:1:0,48
They rode shared bicycles from Zhengzhou to Kaifeng, over ten kilometers away.

26
0:1:0,48 --> 0:1:1,16
Police cars

27
0:1:1,16 --> 0:1:3,12
blocked the six-lane road that night.

28
0:1:3,12 --> 0:1:5,5
The 100-meter-wide Zhengkai Avenue was completely jammed.

29
0:1:5,5 --> 0:1:6,88
The traffic stretched for several kilometers.

30
0:1:6,88 --> 0:1:10,27
It created a uniquely spectacular scene.

31
0:1:10,27 --> 0:1:14,41
However, I think the incident itself is not significant.

32
0:1:14,41 --> 0:1:15,97
It appeared and disappeared without a trace.

33
0:1:15,97 --> 0:1:16,69
It was absurd.

34
0:1:16,69 --> 0:1:17,25
Coincidental.

35
0:1:17,25 --> 0:1:18,1
Irrational.

36
0:1:18,1 --> 0:1:20,3
An unrepeatable one-off event, right?

37
0:1:20,3 --> 0:1:22,74
And I don't think this matter is over and done with.

38
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:25,789
I don’t believe it will have any particularly significant impact on what follows.

39
0:1:25,789 --> 0:1:28,849
But the Zhengzhou night ride is like a symbol,

40
0:1:28,849 --> 0:1:32,1
showing us the young people's sense of drawing their swords and looking around,

41
0:1:32,1 --> 0:1:32,71
feeling lost and aimless,

42
0:1:32,71 --> 0:1:36,8
this scattered passion and vitality with no outlet.

43
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:39,64
It points to a very timely issue,

44
0:1:39,64 --> 0:1:41,35
and for the year 2024,

45
0:1:41,35 --> 0:1:42,87
my thoughts for the entire year of 2024.

46
0:1:42,87 --> 0:1:45,47
An entry point for observing and reflecting on public opinion and social hotspots

47
0:1:45,47 --> 0:1:47,35
That's also what this video aims to convey.

48
0:1:47,35 --> 0:1:50,2
Following the era of significant growth

49
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:54,56
The narrative void or narrative crisis in the hearts of the new generation

50
0:1:55,21 --> 0:1:56,71
Let's take a moment to reflect on human nature

51
0:1:56,71 --> 0:1:59,87
Are we beings that live in reality?

52
0:1:59,87 --> 0:2:2,7
I think both yes and no

53
0:2:2,27 --> 0:2:4,19
I, of course, live in this physical space.

54
0:2:5,39 --> 0:2:7,49
But let's imagine for a moment

55
0:2:7,85 --> 0:2:12,72
A patient who has received a terminal diagnosis

56
0:2:12,72 --> 0:2:16,94
The second before he got the report and the second after he received it

57
0:2:16,94 --> 0:2:18,46
His own body

58
0:2:18,46 --> 0:2:21,14
The environment around him actually remained unchanged

59
0:2:21,14 --> 0:2:22,38
You can't unreasonably claim

60
0:2:22,38 --> 0:2:25,4
That his condition worsened in that second, right?

61
0:2:25,4 --> 0:2:28,8
But why is she in hell in the second after?

62
0:2:28,8 --> 0:2:31,32
While he was in a normal state of mind just a second before?

63
0:2:31,56 --> 0:2:33,18
What exactly changed?

64
0:2:33,18 --> 0:2:34,66
This change is because

65
0:2:34,66 --> 0:2:38,17
in the next moment, he has entered a new narrative

66
0:2:38,17 --> 0:2:40,13
with the new identity of a terminally ill patient

67
0:2:40,13 --> 0:2:42,3
he believes his days are numbered

68
0:2:42,3 --> 0:2:44,85
leading to extremely pessimistic expectations

69
0:2:45,57 --> 0:2:48,72
we humans are creatures that live within narratives

70
0:2:48,72 --> 0:2:50,4
as long as we are alive

71
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:51,82
we will inevitably step into a narrative

72
0:2:51,82 --> 0:2:53,86
taking on and playing a role

73
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:57,2
This is how we understand ourselves and the world.

74
0:2:57,2 --> 0:2:58,72
Narratives encompass the past.

75
0:2:58,72 --> 0:2:59,98
They include where I come from.

76
0:2:59,98 --> 0:3:1,62
Why I am the way I am now.

77
0:3:1,62 --> 0:3:3,42
They also point to the future.

78
0:3:3,42 --> 0:3:5,66
The path I am on.

79
0:3:5,66 --> 0:3:7,18
What lies ahead for me.

80
0:3:7,18 --> 0:3:11,0
Thus, they shape my perception of myself in the present.

81
0:3:11,0 --> 0:3:12,48
And my view of the surrounding environment.

82
0:3:12,48 --> 0:3:13,72
My level of satisfaction now

83
0:3:13,72 --> 0:3:17,2
and how I express my emotions and behaviors

84
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:19,52
Narrative has a dual nature

85
0:3:19,52 --> 0:3:22,2
If a person is completely immersed in a narrative

86
0:3:22,2 --> 0:3:23,64
they can't see any other possibilities

87
0:3:23,64 --> 0:3:26,47
and if they completely lose the perspective and ability to step back

88
0:3:26,47 --> 0:3:27,61
they will be confined

89
0:3:27,61 --> 0:3:29,57
they will be consumed by the role

90
0:3:29,57 --> 0:3:31,899
We see many Chinese-style parents

91
0:3:31,899 --> 0:3:34,259
Having a child is certainly wonderful.

92
0:3:34,259 --> 0:3:36,739
But they might be consumed by the role of father or mother.

93
0:3:36,739 --> 0:3:38,39
This role can overshadow everything else.

94
0:3:38,39 --> 0:3:40,71
Apart from being a father or mother,

95
0:3:40,71 --> 0:3:43,25
they don’t know why they are living.

96
0:3:43,37 --> 0:3:46,1
So they get swallowed up by this role.

97
0:3:46,1 --> 0:3:47,17
They lose their sense of self.

98
0:3:47,17 --> 0:3:49,37
We see this happen a lot.

99
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:52,0
However, on the other hand,

100
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:54,38
Narratives also provide people with a sense of value.

101
0:3:54,38 --> 0:3:56,82
They allow individuals to have their own social roles.

102
0:3:56,82 --> 0:3:58,68
They can give people a sense of belonging.

103
0:3:58,68 --> 0:4:2,719
Sometimes, we can see that narratives unrelated to us

104
0:4:2,719 --> 0:4:6,97
can still provide a sense of value to some people.

105
0:4:6,97 --> 0:4:10,54
Why has Li Ziqi's return attracted so much attention?

106
0:4:10,98 --> 0:4:12,22
Messi's championship victory,

107
0:4:12,22 --> 0:4:15,2
Why does Zheng Qinwen's championship win inspire people?

108
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:18,909
Why does the era's boy band, TFBOYS, have such a large following?

109
0:4:18,909 --> 0:4:19,949
To some extent

110
0:4:19,949 --> 0:4:23,69
it's due to their tumultuous personal growth stories

111
0:4:23,69 --> 0:4:25,189
they have at least in front of their audience

112
0:4:25,189 --> 0:4:26,389
they've gone through hardships

113
0:4:26,389 --> 0:4:28,5
they've achieved growth

114
0:4:28,5 --> 0:4:30,57
in the end, they've crossed a mountain

115
0:4:30,57 --> 0:4:31,97
reached the other side, right?

116
0:4:31,97 --> 0:4:33,77
it's a personal narrative

117
0:4:33,77 --> 0:4:36,21
I even think it could be said

118
0:4:36,21 --> 0:4:38,21
The consumption logic of the entire modern sports industry

119
0:4:38,21 --> 0:4:39,37
is built on storytelling.

120
0:4:39,37 --> 0:4:40,83
Of course, that's a bit of a stretch.

121
0:4:40,83 --> 0:4:45,17
If someone can't form a strong, personal connection

122
0:4:45,17 --> 0:4:46,47
with a stable narrative figure,

123
0:4:46,47 --> 0:4:47,99
they can't define their own role

124
0:4:47,99 --> 0:4:50,7
and place in the world.

125
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:53,7
They might end up feeling lost and disoriented.

126
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:56,6
If at this point they are actually doing well, though

127
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:56,9
He's living quite comfortably.

128
0:4:56,9 --> 0:4:57,78
That's not much of a problem.

129
0:4:57,78 --> 0:5:0,8
Because this is just a state of being for modern people,

130
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:2,66
a common sense of confusion and emptiness among contemporary individuals, right?

131
0:5:2,66 --> 0:5:6,39
But if he's really not doing well,

132
0:5:6,39 --> 0:5:8,1
living in hardship,

133
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:10,43
then a person might become more vulnerable,

134
0:5:10,43 --> 0:5:11,99
find it harder to get through tough times,

135
0:5:11,99 --> 0:5:14,27
or even more likely to become extreme.

136
0:5:14,27 --> 0:5:16,51
Within a cycle in our society,

137
0:5:16,51 --> 0:5:17,83
there are primarily two prevailing narratives,

138
0:5:17,83 --> 0:5:19,19
one of which is the collective narrative,

139
0:5:19,19 --> 0:5:21,53
which is essentially the Chinese version of MAGA,

140
0:5:21,53 --> 0:5:23,78
a narrative many people believe in,

141
0:5:23,78 --> 0:5:24,46
the vast majority of people,

142
0:5:24,46 --> 0:5:27,64
who believe that our compatriots can work together for a common cause,

143
0:5:27,64 --> 0:5:31,31
and that this effort will ultimately benefit us all,

144
0:5:31,31 --> 0:5:34,63
and we are even willing to make significant sacrifices for it.

145
0:5:34,63 --> 0:5:37,4
Concessions and sacrifices in personal interests

146
0:5:37,28 --> 0:5:38,56
This narrative

147
0:5:38,56 --> 0:5:41,76
I still believe that after many twists and turns

148
0:5:41,76 --> 0:5:43,82
This narrative will ultimately prevail

149
0:5:43,82 --> 0:5:46,58
But in recent years, due to cyclical reasons

150
0:5:46,58 --> 0:5:48,2
It has faced some challenges

151
0:5:48,2 --> 0:5:50,5
It's hard to provide the same level of intensity as before

152
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:52,6
In terms of setting strong goals

153
0:5:52,6 --> 0:5:53,169
And a sense of power

154
0:5:53,169 --> 0:5:55,309
I won't go into too much detail about this today.

155
0:5:55,309 --> 0:5:57,649
But I think there's a fundamental principle.

156
0:5:57,649 --> 0:6:1,58
That is, all love in the world actually comes with conditions and logic.

157
0:6:1,58 --> 0:6:2,8
Unconditional love,

158
0:6:2,8 --> 0:6:4,19
is rare in this world.

159
0:6:4,19 --> 0:6:4,91
The post-90s generation,

160
0:6:4,91 --> 0:6:7,25
Why is this generation, born after 1995, so patriotic?

161
0:6:7,25 --> 0:6:8,89
so trusting of collective narratives,

162
0:6:8,89 --> 0:6:11,85
largely because from the time they can remember,

163
0:6:11,85 --> 0:6:13,69
We were already doing well

164
0:6:13,69 --> 0:6:15,17
After the Reform and Opening up

165
0:6:15,17 --> 0:6:16,13
Almost 20 years of development

166
0:6:16,13 --> 0:6:17,19
The foundation was already quite solid

167
0:6:17,19 --> 0:6:18,89
And during their growth

168
0:6:18,89 --> 0:6:21,65
They witnessed everything around them and their families improving

169
0:6:21,65 --> 0:6:22,25
Right?

170
0:6:22,25 --> 0:6:24,9
The development of society and their personal interests

171
0:6:24,9 --> 0:6:25,77
Were highly aligned during this period

172
0:6:25,77 --> 0:6:27,51
This is a crucial premise.

173
0:6:27,51 --> 0:6:29,21
Now the growth rate has slowed down.

174
0:6:29,21 --> 0:6:31,359
More and more people are realizing

175
0:6:31,359 --> 0:6:35,22
that many things may not necessarily benefit them personally.

176
0:6:35,22 --> 0:6:38,54
the enthusiasm and intensity of this collective narrative

177
0:6:38,54 --> 0:6:39,78
have also diminished.

178
0:6:39,78 --> 0:6:40,78
I won't elaborate on this.

179
0:6:40,78 --> 0:6:42,26
If you don't have a strong sense of it,

180
0:6:42,26 --> 0:6:45,43
you can check out the last three Olympic Games.

181
0:6:45,43 --> 0:6:48,59
The curve of the audience's enthusiasm and public opinion foundation

182
0:6:48,59 --> 0:6:49,27
has undergone a change

183
0:6:49,27 --> 0:6:51,15
We can also look at the enthusiasm of the younger generation

184
0:6:51,15 --> 0:6:54,98
towards topics like deep space exploration

185
0:6:54,98 --> 0:6:57,16
and the changes over the past one or two decades

186
0:6:57,16 --> 0:6:58,9
I think this can reveal broader trends

187
0:6:58,9 --> 0:7:0,93
and the changes behind it

188
0:7:1,5 --> 0:7:4,21
In the previous cycle, another popular narrative

189
0:7:4,21 --> 0:7:8,13
was the individual narrative of superiority driven by growth

190
0:7:8,13 --> 0:7:10,63
Let's imagine two young people who are equally impoverished

191
0:7:10,63 --> 0:7:13,45
and living what is generally considered an ordinary life.

192
0:7:13,45 --> 0:7:15,61
One of them believes that this is how his life will always be.

193
0:7:15,61 --> 0:7:17,27
He sees no possibility of improving his situation.

194
0:7:17,27 --> 0:7:18,9
His life will not get any better.

195
0:7:18,9 --> 0:7:20,7
The other person, however, believes in his grievances,

196
0:7:20,7 --> 0:7:21,46
his discomfort,

197
0:7:21,46 --> 0:7:22,24
his sadness,

198
0:7:22,24 --> 0:7:23,5
seeing them as only temporary.

199
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:27,44
As long as he firmly believes he can rise to prominence in the future

200
0:7:27,44 --> 0:7:30,4
the next person will have a good life experience

201
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:30,36
Why?

202
0:7:30,36 --> 0:7:31,88
Because he has something to look forward to

203
0:7:32,9 --> 0:7:33,95
I was born in 1988

204
0:7:33,95 --> 0:7:35,45
When we were in our twenties

205
0:7:35,45 --> 0:7:39,31
It might be hard for you to believe now, but

206
0:7:39,31 --> 0:7:40,97
anyone around us

207
0:7:40,97 --> 0:7:43,21
almost everyone believed it was a given that things would get better next year

208
0:7:43,21 --> 0:7:45,1
It will be better than this year.

209
0:7:45,1 --> 0:7:46,6
Or take a step back.

210
0:7:46,6 --> 0:7:47,98
Or step back a bit.

211
0:7:47,98 --> 0:7:50,3
Even if next year might bring all sorts of changes.

212
0:7:50,3 --> 0:7:54,44
But in three years, my life will definitely be better than it is now.

213
0:7:54,44 --> 0:7:58,8
And we assume that our salaries will naturally increase every year.

214
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:0,44
Even if my work doesn't advance further.

215
0:8:0,44 --> 0:8:2,2
Even if my performance doesn't improve.

216
0:8:2,2 --> 0:8:6,64
But isn't it only natural for salaries to rise by 5% each year?

217
0:8:7,7 --> 0:8:10,29
And my spending power and wealth will naturally rise accordingly.

218
0:8:10,29 --> 0:8:12,59
But now, do people still believe

219
0:8:12,59 --> 0:8:15,26
that their lives will definitely be better three years from now?

220
0:8:15,26 --> 0:8:17,3
Everyone might have their own answer.

221
0:8:17,3 --> 0:8:20,98
But the answers I get from my observations and those around me are

222
0:8:20,98 --> 0:8:22,77
people are not as confident anymore.

223
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:25,57
A significant proportion of people even think the opposite.

224
0:8:25,57 --> 0:8:27,81
That is, they just hope next year will be the same as this year.

225
0:8:27,81 --> 0:8:29,84
I would already be grateful for that.

226
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:31,9
Especially for those who have entered society

227
0:8:31,9 --> 0:8:34,7
they might be more inclined to view it this way

228
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:39,4
Now, the two narratives of the collective and the individual mentioned earlier

229
0:8:39,4 --> 0:8:41,46
one is a Chinese version of a mama

230
0:8:41,46 --> 0:8:44,51
the other is a superiority-driven personal narrative

231
0:8:44,51 --> 0:8:48,26
these were the two main narratives popular in the last cycle

232
0:8:48,26 --> 0:8:50,26
whether it's the collective or the individual

233
0:8:50,26 --> 0:8:51,5
from a certain perspective

234
0:8:51,5 --> 0:8:52,74
they are both part of winology

235
0:8:52,74 --> 0:8:55,22
I believe in myself

236
0:8:55,22 --> 0:8:57,8
We can win

237
0:8:57,8 --> 0:8:58,78
And keep winning

238
0:8:58,78 --> 0:9:2,9
So I'm on the winning side

239
0:9:2,9 --> 0:9:4,49
Of course, I can build a narrative that satisfies me

240
0:9:4,49 --> 0:9:6,75
a narrative space that provides value to oneself

241
0:9:6,75 --> 0:9:7,97
This space is quite large.

242
0:9:7,97 --> 0:9:9,66
When I can win

243
0:9:9,66 --> 0:9:11,38
But the issue is winning

244
0:9:11,38 --> 0:9:13,74
The issue with learning is what to do if you can't keep winning

245
0:9:13,74 --> 0:9:14,98
This is the problem with competitive learning.

246
0:9:14,98 --> 0:9:18,11
It's the value it gives to people that is not inherently generated.

247
0:9:18,11 --> 0:9:21,7
Its value is based on comparison.

248
0:9:21,7 --> 0:9:25,3
For example, if you are part of a group that emphasizes competitive learning,

249
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:28,78
you must believe that Chinese cuisine is the best in the world,

250
0:9:28,78 --> 0:9:31,26
our culture is the most advanced in the world,

251
0:9:31,26 --> 0:9:34,6
our language is the most beautiful and melodious in the world,

252
0:9:34,6 --> 0:9:35,42
and we are on the rise.

253
0:9:35,42 --> 0:9:36,54
Others are reducing it

254
0:9:36,54 --> 0:9:38,82
That's why you would fall in love with this land

255
0:9:38,82 --> 0:9:42,2
Not just because of our food

256
0:9:42,2 --> 0:9:44,31
Our culture and our language

257
0:9:44,31 --> 0:9:47,15
Don't just make you feel close and delighted

258
0:9:47,15 --> 0:9:48,839
But rather, you come to love this land

259
0:9:48,839 --> 0:9:50,659
There's a difference between these two

260
0:9:50,659 --> 0:9:53,41
Just by watching Bilibili, we can find many people

261
0:9:53,41 --> 0:9:54,49
If you talk to him

262
0:9:54,49 --> 0:9:56,49
There are many languages in the world that are truly beautiful

263
0:9:56,49 --> 0:9:57,49
French is also very beautiful

264
0:9:57,49 --> 0:9:58,17
Tell him that

265
0:9:58,17 --> 0:10:0,5
There are many foods in the world that are delicious

266
0:10:0,5 --> 0:10:1,66
Then it might break down

267
0:10:1,66 --> 0:10:2,42
Why

268
0:10:2,42 --> 0:10:5,84
Because his sense of value is not intrinsic

269
0:10:5,84 --> 0:10:8,14
It has to be based on comparison

270
0:10:8,14 --> 0:10:9,56
You have to win

271
0:10:9,56 --> 0:10:12,1
Only then will you truly love this land.

272
0:10:12,1 --> 0:10:14,96
This is even more so from a personal narrative perspective.

273
0:10:14,96 --> 0:10:18,16
Our entire education system is built on the foundation of meritocracy.

274
0:10:18,16 --> 0:10:20,84
The atmosphere of UG has seeped into our very bones.

275
0:10:20,84 --> 0:10:22,64
Although Europe and America also have their quiet and secluded charm,

276
0:10:22,64 --> 0:10:24,49
this game is played at the highest level here,

277
0:10:24,49 --> 0:10:25,45
most widely,

278
0:10:25,45 --> 0:10:28,13
and penetrates every corner of society, especially in the three major East Asian countries.

279
0:10:28,13 --> 0:10:30,319
I believe there's little doubt about this.

280
0:10:30,319 --> 0:10:33,599
Old Zhong always felt that he was never good enough.

281
0:10:33,599 --> 0:10:35,39
It was a life of never being acknowledged.

282
0:10:35,39 --> 0:10:35,679
From childhood to adulthood,

283
0:10:35,679 --> 0:10:36,399
we were all taught

284
0:10:36,399 --> 0:10:38,239
that we shouldn't seek comfort,

285
0:10:38,239 --> 0:10:39,25
or indulge in pleasure.

286
0:10:39,25 --> 0:10:40,57
We should focus on the bigger picture,

287
0:10:40,57 --> 0:10:41,37
look to the future,

288
0:10:41,37 --> 0:10:42,5
born in adversity.

289
0:10:42,5 --> 0:10:42,69
Death from comfort

290
0:10:42,69 --> 0:10:43,89
Better to prepare for the rain before it falls, right?

291
0:10:43,89 --> 0:10:45,819
This is something we often hear.

292
0:10:45,819 --> 0:10:47,559
You have to memorize ancient poems even in kindergarten.

293
0:10:47,559 --> 0:10:48,179
Learn English.

294
0:10:48,179 --> 0:10:49,819
You need to win from the starting line.

295
0:10:49,819 --> 0:10:51,98
Study to change your fate.

296
0:10:51,98 --> 0:10:53,84
We see slogans on the classroom walls.

297
0:10:53,84 --> 0:10:55,24
The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from bitter cold.

298
0:10:55,24 --> 0:10:56,2
Today's sweat

299
0:10:56,2 --> 0:10:57,69
Tomorrow's harvest

300
0:10:57,69 --> 0:11:0,709
So any fun you have while studying feels like a crime

301
0:11:0,709 --> 0:11:2,709
You end up judging yourself internally

302
0:11:2,709 --> 0:11:4,99
And even if you rank in the top 10%

303
0:11:4,99 --> 0:11:6,47
You're already quite outstanding

304
0:11:6,47 --> 0:11:8,17
But you can't afford to let your guard down

305
0:11:8,17 --> 0:11:9,1
Why

306
0:11:9,1 --> 0:11:12,37
Because a single point in the entire province can mean a whole playground of people

307
0:11:12,37 --> 0:11:15,7
You'll always feel like you're not good enough

308
0:11:15,7 --> 0:11:17,93
and once this mindset becomes a habit

309
0:11:17,93 --> 0:11:20,65
it's likely to accompany you throughout your life as you enter society

310
0:11:20,65 --> 0:11:21,21
and start working

311
0:11:21,21 --> 0:11:24,33
you may still feel this pervasive external judgment

312
0:11:24,33 --> 0:11:25,46
along with the pressure of responsibility

313
0:11:25,46 --> 0:11:28,46
you can't provide yourself with enough support

314
0:11:28,46 --> 0:11:29,9
to keep you moving forward

315
0:11:29,9 --> 0:11:30,82
in this environment

316
0:11:30,82 --> 0:11:31,9
You must be outstanding.

317
0:11:31,9 --> 0:11:32,82
You must be ambitious.

318
0:11:32,82 --> 0:11:35,48
And the definition of this excellence is not up to you.

319
0:11:35,48 --> 0:11:37,56
It’s a composite score based on your education,

320
0:11:37,56 --> 0:11:38,8
career,

321
0:11:38,8 --> 0:11:38,9
marital status,

322
0:11:38,9 --> 0:11:39,6
income level,

323
0:11:39,6 --> 0:11:43,4
location, and various other factors,

324
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:44,68
resulting in a hidden score.

325
0:11:44,68 --> 0:11:46,56
No one knows what this formula actually is

326
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:47,96
But when you go home for the Spring Festival

327
0:11:47,96 --> 0:11:51,95
You can feel how much this hidden score is

328
0:11:51,95 --> 0:11:53,67
Because your relatives and friends around you

329
0:11:53,67 --> 0:11:58,15
The environment around you will judge you

330
0:11:58,5 --> 0:12:1,4
Due to the reasons mentioned above

331
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:3,38
Whether it's a collective or personal narrative

332
0:12:3,38 --> 0:12:5,6
From the previous cycle

333
0:12:5,6 --> 0:12:6,66
It is built on comparison

334
0:12:6,66 --> 0:12:7,88
It's not intrinsic.

335
0:12:7,88 --> 0:12:9,96
So it requires a lot of prerequisites.

336
0:12:9,96 --> 0:12:12,42
The many prerequisite standards are still in others' hands.

337
0:12:12,42 --> 0:12:14,84
So when you can't win anymore,

338
0:12:14,84 --> 0:12:17,83
both collective and individual narratives collapse in sequence.

339
0:12:17,83 --> 0:12:21,31
This leads to a void in one's heart after the loss of values.

340
0:12:21,31 --> 0:12:22,45
Let's look at young people today.

341
0:12:22,45 --> 0:12:23,77
As I mentioned in one of my previous videos

342
0:12:23,77 --> 0:12:28,2
his mindset is in a state of being neither up nor down.

343
0:12:28,2 --> 0:12:30,52
There's no real way to not live on.

344
0:12:30,52 --> 0:12:33,8
The kind of biological survival crisis where you can't afford to eat.

345
0:12:33,8 --> 0:12:35,56
Because if you have this sense of survival crisis,

346
0:12:35,56 --> 0:12:36,9
all narratives are just nonsense.

347
0:12:36,9 --> 0:12:37,72
It doesn't matter anymore.

348
0:12:37,72 --> 0:12:40,2
You would fight with all your might to stay alive.

349
0:12:40,2 --> 0:12:43,31
This is an instinct embedded in our biological genes.

350
0:12:43,31 --> 0:12:44,55
However,

351
0:12:44,55 --> 0:12:48,11
we are now in the next era.

352
0:12:48,11 --> 0:12:51,21
This sense of hunger amidst warmth and fullness

353
0:12:51,21 --> 0:12:54,21
The fear of freezing to death is gone

354
0:12:54,21 --> 0:12:57,37
Sure, you won't starve

355
0:12:57,37 --> 0:13:0,29
But it's hard to feel like you're living a human life

356
0:13:0,29 --> 0:13:3,765
It's hard to feel like you have achievements and dignity

357
0:13:4,24 --> 0:13:5,38
Hope

358
0:13:5,38 --> 0:13:8,16
Something beyond mere survival

359
0:13:8,16 --> 0:13:11,1
A sense of purpose

360
0:13:11,1 --> 0:13:14,6
It's hard to feel like you're truly living a human life

361
0:13:14,6 --> 0:13:16,46
But just being alive is not enough.

362
0:13:16,46 --> 0:13:17,56
It's actually insufficient.

363
0:13:17,56 --> 0:13:18,82
No matter how pragmatic a person is,

364
0:13:18,82 --> 0:13:19,62
living in this world,

365
0:13:19,62 --> 0:13:21,9
you need to have something to look forward to.

366
0:13:21,9 --> 0:13:23,9
Many people consider themselves entirely pragmatic,

367
0:13:23,9 --> 0:13:25,17
but they still need something to look forward to.

368
0:13:25,17 --> 0:13:26,97
Something that transcends mere survival.

369
0:13:26,97 --> 0:13:30,78
Or as Fukuyama puts it in his work on identity,

370
0:13:30,78 --> 0:13:32,2
the driving force behind human behavior,

371
0:13:32,2 --> 0:13:35,18
besides the desires and rationality mentioned in traditional economics,

372
0:13:35,18 --> 0:13:38,68
includes this passion for life.

373
0:13:39,68 --> 0:13:42,87
When this passion has no outlet,

374
0:13:42,87 --> 0:13:46,19
when there's a lack of value and a void in narrative,

375
0:13:46,19 --> 0:13:47,61
it manifests like a performance,

376
0:13:47,61 --> 0:13:50,81
creating many bizarre phenomena,

377
0:13:50,81 --> 0:13:53,19
becoming a backdrop of the era's mood.

378
0:13:53,19 --> 0:13:55,99
The popular crazy literature in recent years, for instance,

379
0:13:55,99 --> 0:13:57,45
the omnipresent accelerationists,

380
0:13:57,45 --> 0:13:58,95
the increasingly wild science,

381
0:13:58,95 --> 0:14:1,4
the night riding in Zhengzhou mentioned at the beginning,

382
0:14:1,4 --> 0:14:4,569
the dramatic passion of Fuhang this year,

383
0:14:4,569 --> 0:14:8,489
and the deeply saddening events that occurred in the second half of last year,

384
0:14:8,489 --> 0:14:9,589
in Zhuhai and Wuxi,

385
0:14:9,589 --> 0:14:11,36
the extreme incidents in Wuxi,

386
0:14:11,36 --> 0:14:14,58
individually, they all have various specific causes,

387
0:14:14,58 --> 0:14:18,69
but they are also the cracks and fissures opened by this aimless passion.

388
0:14:18,69 --> 0:14:23,19
This is my observation of social emotions and phenomena for 2024,

389
0:14:23,19 --> 0:14:25,53
the first part of my series.

390
0:14:25,53 --> 0:14:30,21
In the next part, I will delve deeper,

391
0:14:30,21 --> 0:14:34,48
covering even more aspects,

392
0:14:34,48 --> 0:14:35,44
still under the same theme.

393
0:14:35,44 --> 0:14:37,92
I'm Lao Jiang,

394
0:14:37,92 --> 0:14:40,2
So, I'm Lao Jiang.

395
0:14:40,2 --> 0:14:41,28
If you found this episode insightful and helpful,

396
0:14:41,28 --> 0:14:43,52
An UPloader who enjoys sharing their observations and thoughts

397
0:14:43,52 --> 0:14:45,88
The next episode will be out within a week,

398
0:14:45,88 --> 0:14:46,4
thank you all,

399
0:14:46,4 --> 0:14:47,54
I hope you can give it a Triple Combo.

400
0:14:47,54 --> 0:14:50,12
with good eating and sleeping,

401
0:14:50,12 --> 0:14:51,8
and achieving your goals,

402
0:14:51,8 --> 0:14:53,78
thanks.
