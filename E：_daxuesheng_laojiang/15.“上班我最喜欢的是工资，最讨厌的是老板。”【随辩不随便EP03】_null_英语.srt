1
0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:1,48
The boss's foolish decisions

2
0:0:1,48 --> 0:0:3,2
I used to oppose them frequently

3
0:0:3,2 --> 0:0:4,94
Most of the time, the outcome was

4
0:0:4,94 --> 0:0:7,42
Pointless. Not every opposition needs to be a hard fight

5
0:0:7,42 --> 0:0:9,68
You can offer some mild objections

6
0:0:9,68 --> 0:0:10,88
Now I choose to comply

7
0:0:10,88 --> 0:0:11,88
Because I have realized

8
0:0:11,88 --> 0:0:12,54
That opposition is futile

9
0:0:12,54 --> 0:0:16,34
Excessive compliance can lead to an organizational inertia of silence

10
0:0:16,34 --> 0:0:17,68
Which could very likely accelerate decline

11
0:0:17,68 --> 0:0:18,56
If you oppose it

12
0:0:18,56 --> 0:0:20,4
A good outcome is the only true result

13
0:0:20,4 --> 0:0:20,98
An unfavorable outcome is the cost

14
0:0:20,98 --> 0:0:22,22
If I ask you to spend 5000 on a Spring Festival Gala

15
0:0:22,22 --> 0:0:24,2
Do you oppose this?

16
0:0:24,2 --> 0:0:25,8
Before there's an objective outcome

17
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:28,53
I don't think anyone can predict it in advance

18
0:0:28,53 --> 0:0:30,31
This is a matter of being wise or foolish

19
0:0:30,31 --> 0:0:32,73
Don't bring up any grand ideals with me right now.

20
0:0:32,73 --> 0:0:34,45
I'm struggling with my current predicament

21
0:0:34,45 --> 0:0:37,935
I now believe that the brave ones are the first to embrace the world

22
0:0:39,11 --> 0:0:40,27
Critical thinking knows no bounds

23
0:0:40,27 --> 0:0:41,63
Welcome to our casual space

24
0:0:41,63 --> 0:0:44,99
Welcome everyone to the 'Casual or Not' show, brought to you by Bilibili

25
0:0:44,99 --> 0:0:46,38
I'm the host for today.

26
0:0:49,0 --> 0:0:51,769
In the workplace, what I like most is the salary

27
0:0:51,769 --> 0:0:53,289
What I fear the most is my boss

28
0:0:53,289 --> 0:0:55,7
Worse than a boss is a boss who has lost it

29
0:0:55,7 --> 0:0:57,4
When we encounter a boss

30
0:0:57,4 --> 0:0:58,48
Some opinions might not be very wise

31
0:0:58,48 --> 0:0:59,38
It might seem a bit crazy

32
0:0:59,38 --> 0:1:0,62
or even a bit foolish

33
0:1:0,62 --> 0:1:2,209
I don’t know how everyone would choose

34
0:1:2,209 --> 0:1:5,289
some might opt for silence as a virtue

35
0:1:5,289 --> 0:1:6,71
enduring for a calm and peaceful outcome

36
0:1:6,71 --> 0:1:10,23
while others might step up

37
0:1:10,23 --> 0:1:11,9
for the sake of truth

38
0:1:11,9 --> 0:1:12,1
the more we debate, the clearer it becomes

39
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:13,61
this is today’s debate topic

40
0:1:13,61 --> 0:1:15,92
the boss’s foolish decision

41
0:1:15,92 --> 0:1:18,14
Should I comply or oppose?

42
0:1:18,14 --> 0:1:21,64
First, let me invite our debaters from both sides.

43
0:1:21,64 --> 0:1:23,9
Proponent Zhang Eerda

44
0:1:23,9 --> 0:1:28,47
Opponent representative, psychology expert, and commentator Lao Jiang, who is extremely reliable

45
0:1:28,47 --> 0:1:32,2
Now, let's move on to our formal casual debate segment.

46
0:1:32,2 --> 0:1:33,68
The casual debate is divided into

47
0:1:33,68 --> 0:1:34,68
Casual argumentation

48
0:1:34,68 --> 0:1:35,9
Soul-searching questions

49
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:37,6
High-energy rebuttals

50
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:38,21
Rebuttal summary

51
0:1:38,21 --> 0:1:39,67
Let's wrap it up casually.

52
0:1:39,67 --> 0:1:41,45
We have six casual segments for everyone.

53
0:1:41,45 --> 0:1:43,73
Next, I will announce the rules for being casual or not.

54
0:1:43,73 --> 0:1:46,78
The third debate session is now officially starting.

55
0:1:46,78 --> 0:1:49,58
First, we have the casual opening statement round.

56
0:1:49,58 --> 0:1:52,76
Each side has four minutes to present their opening arguments.

57
0:1:52,76 --> 0:1:55,32
Let's start with the affirmative team.

58
0:1:55,32 --> 0:1:56,8
Hello, everyone.

59
0:1:56,8 --> 0:1:57,1
I need to put on my armor first.

60
0:1:57,1 --> 0:1:59,4
I am the deputy head of a media company.

61
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:0,6
This question suits me well.

62
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:2,5
It's because I'm the closest to the boss,

63
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:3,5
the closest to foolishness,

64
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:5,78
and the closest to making decisions.

65
0:2:5,78 --> 0:2:8,46
And for this debate, I'm on the affirmative side.

66
0:2:8,46 --> 0:2:10,17
It's because I can only be on the affirmative side.

67
0:2:10,17 --> 0:2:11,73
If I chose to oppose,

68
0:2:11,73 --> 0:2:12,85
I wouldn't be able to take the day off today,

69
0:2:12,85 --> 0:2:14,5
and I might not be able to be here.

70
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:15,44
The boss's foolish decision,

71
0:2:15,44 --> 0:2:16,96
I used to oppose it frequently as well.

72
0:2:16,96 --> 0:2:18,86
Most of the time, the result is just four words.

73
0:2:18,86 --> 0:2:19,62
Totally useless.

74
0:2:19,62 --> 0:2:22,32
I believe all employees have heard this line:

75
0:2:22,32 --> 0:2:24,58
It goes, 'I have a little idea.'

76
0:2:24,58 --> 0:2:27,4
I have no idea how this became a nationwide standard.

77
0:2:27,4 --> 0:2:29,22
Today, we're going live to sell products.

78
0:2:29,22 --> 0:2:30,74
Tomorrow, we're diving into cross-border e-commerce.

79
0:2:30,74 --> 0:2:32,5
These are the little tricks in the boss's mind.

80
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:33,9
Gulp, gulp, gulp.

81
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:35,28
It's the same as what we get wholesale from Yiwu

82
0:2:35,28 --> 0:2:37,91
He feels ideas bubbling up every day

83
0:2:37,91 --> 0:2:39,63
Can we stop the gushing spring?

84
0:2:39,63 --> 0:2:41,43
This goes against nature

85
0:2:41,43 --> 0:2:44,6
The key is to stop the gushing spring

86
0:2:44,6 --> 0:2:45,16
What do we want to do?

87
0:2:45,16 --> 0:2:46,56
I initially thought it was simple

88
0:2:46,56 --> 0:2:48,82
To prevent the water from splashing onto me

89
0:2:48,82 --> 0:2:50,56
But I put in a lot of effort

90
0:2:50,56 --> 0:2:51,86
I managed to block the spring source

91
0:2:51,86 --> 0:2:54,4
Is he not going to move underground anymore?

92
0:2:54,4 --> 0:2:55,2
I blocked the spring.

93
0:2:55,2 --> 0:2:55,88
I was just feeling happy.

94
0:2:55,88 --> 0:2:56,64
Hehe, it poisoned me.

95
0:2:56,64 --> 0:2:57,44
I turned around and saw

96
0:2:57,44 --> 0:2:58,5
the volcano erupted.

97
0:2:58,5 --> 0:2:59,78
The spring is gone.

98
0:2:59,78 --> 0:3:1,11
The lava is coming.

99
0:3:1,11 --> 0:3:2,13
It's even worse than the spring.

100
0:3:2,13 --> 0:3:5,9
So my first thought was that it's unstoppable.

101
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:6,14
Ideas flow like a spring

102
0:3:6,14 --> 0:3:7,22
Let's not get in the way

103
0:3:7,22 --> 0:3:8,24
When the flood comes

104
0:3:8,24 --> 0:3:9,28
It's best to learn how to swim

105
0:3:9,28 --> 0:3:10,2
Nothing beats that

106
0:3:10,2 --> 0:3:12,16
Especially in the Yangtze River Delta region

107
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:12,96
Free shipping in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai

108
0:3:12,96 --> 0:3:14,14
After all, we need to learn this

109
0:3:14,14 --> 0:3:15,36
This is my first idea

110
0:3:15,36 --> 0:3:17,52
My second thought is about a noon one day

111
0:3:17,52 --> 0:3:19,95
That was a minor incident when I just started working.

112
0:3:19,95 --> 0:3:23,63
We are closely connected to the domestic entertainment industry.

113
0:3:23,63 --> 0:3:25,75
I've thought about it countless nights.

114
0:3:25,75 --> 0:3:28,509
One year, we organized an event at Taihu Bay.

115
0:3:28,509 --> 0:3:31,269
An artist told me at the time,

116
0:3:31,269 --> 0:3:33,189
He insisted on staying in a sea-view room.

117
0:3:33,189 --> 0:3:34,94
I told him this is Changzhou.

118
0:3:34,94 --> 0:3:35,86
Where's the sea?

119
0:3:35,86 --> 0:3:36,86
He said he didn't care.

120
0:3:36,86 --> 0:3:37,92
I'm not a big star anymore.

121
0:3:37,92 --> 0:3:38,68
It's also a mid-range brand

122
0:3:38,68 --> 0:3:41,44
Now, for all my events, I only stay in ocean-view rooms

123
0:3:41,44 --> 0:3:42,58
I got really upset at that time

124
0:3:42,58 --> 0:3:43,8
Whether it's a big brand or a small one

125
0:3:43,8 --> 0:3:44,24
Men's and women's volleyball

126
0:3:44,24 --> 0:3:44,88
Have some chicken cutlets

127
0:3:44,88 --> 0:3:45,76
Call my boss for me

128
0:3:45,76 --> 0:3:46,829
I said, take a look

129
0:3:46,829 --> 0:3:47,669
Support me

130
0:3:47,669 --> 0:3:48,349
What I mean

131
0:3:48,349 --> 0:3:51,64
But my boss said to arrange a sea-view room for him

132
0:3:51,64 --> 0:3:53,18
He wants a sea-view room

133
0:3:53,18 --> 0:3:54,96
So find him a sea-view room

134
0:3:54,96 --> 0:3:57,7
I thought it was ridiculous at the time

135
0:3:57,7 --> 0:3:58,75
He lacks geographical knowledge

136
0:3:58,75 --> 0:3:59,99
Do you lack it too?

137
0:3:59,99 --> 0:4:0,99
I got angry

138
0:4:0,99 --> 0:4:3,4
I said I wouldn't handle this matter

139
0:4:3,4 --> 0:4:4,28
You figure it out yourself

140
0:4:4,28 --> 0:4:7,58
Turns out, in the afternoon, our boss did post a message in the group

141
0:4:7,58 --> 0:4:11,14
He said he found you the nearest sea-view room, brother.

142
0:4:11,14 --> 0:4:12,38
The scenery is beautiful.

143
0:4:12,38 --> 0:4:14,52
It's 240 kilometers away from here.

144
0:4:14,52 --> 0:4:16,9
The drive takes about three hours.

145
0:4:16,9 --> 0:4:20,57
So we'll pick you up at four in the morning on the day of the event.

146
0:4:20,57 --> 0:4:23,45
Please make sure to set an alarm for 3:30 AM to wake up.

147
0:4:24,45 --> 0:4:27,7
If you want to get a good rest,

148
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:29,1
we've also prepared a lake-view room for you.

149
0:4:29,1 --> 0:4:30,49
I can get you a couple of large hairy crabs as well.

150
0:4:30,49 --> 0:4:33,76
All the artists for this event are staying at this hotel.

151
0:4:33,76 --> 0:4:35,38
You have the chance to have a good conversation.

152
0:4:35,38 --> 0:4:37,16
Take a look and see which one you want to choose.

153
0:4:37,16 --> 0:4:38,42
I saw this text in the group at that time.

154
0:4:38,42 --> 0:4:39,46
I felt so foolish myself.

155
0:4:39,46 --> 0:4:40,54
Back then, I was just starting my internship.

156
0:4:40,54 --> 0:4:43,51
I felt like I only saw the surface right and wrong.

157
0:4:43,51 --> 0:4:45,25
I was still struggling with the geographical facts.

158
0:4:45,25 --> 0:4:47,77
But the essence of cooperation is the exchange of benefits.

159
0:4:47,77 --> 0:4:50,4
The fact that he could bring up this foolish idea means that

160
0:4:50,4 --> 0:4:52,6
The foolish idea is what he cares about the most.

161
0:4:52,6 --> 0:4:53,34
I thought Stupid A was a sea-view room

162
0:4:53,34 --> 0:4:54,46
But Stupid A is his pride

163
0:4:54,46 --> 0:4:57,2
When you oppose Stupid A, you're opposing his pride

164
0:4:57,2 --> 0:5:0,58
So no matter how stupid Stupid A seems to me

165
0:5:0,58 --> 0:5:1,7
I have to go along with it

166
0:5:1,7 --> 0:5:4,6
Even if we bring up a Wise B to counter Stupid A

167
0:5:4,6 --> 0:5:7,52
He still has to be an option on the table

168
0:5:7,52 --> 0:5:8,96
After this little incident

169
0:5:8,96 --> 0:5:10,76
I suddenly realized something very important

170
0:5:10,76 --> 0:5:12,28
I finally got it

171
0:5:12,28 --> 0:5:14,44
It seems like 99% of the company's decisions have nothing to do with me

172
0:5:14,44 --> 0:5:16,84
I just have to do 99% of the work no matter what

173
0:5:16,84 --> 0:5:18,179
and carry 99% of the burden

174
0:5:18,179 --> 0:5:19,859
only to receive a measly 9.9 yuan bonus

175
0:5:19,859 --> 0:5:21,19
and end up getting food poisoning from the cheap meals

176
0:5:21,19 --> 0:5:22,679
Since we have to push through anyway

177
0:5:22,679 --> 0:5:25,179
I'll happily execute the smart decisions

178
0:5:25,179 --> 0:5:26,299
the stupid ones

179
0:5:26,299 --> 0:5:27,639
I'll grumble and moan while doing them

180
0:5:27,639 --> 0:5:29,49
there's no point in putting up more resistance

181
0:5:29,49 --> 0:5:30,81
Loving others can be exhausting.

182
0:5:30,81 --> 0:5:32,11
We need to learn how to conserve our energy.

183
0:5:32,11 --> 0:5:33,33
Ideas flow like a spring.

184
0:5:33,33 --> 0:5:34,84
Seek out opportunities.

185
0:5:34,84 --> 0:5:37,26
That’s a key trait of a boss.

186
0:5:37,26 --> 0:5:38,76
When this trait is applied in the right context,

187
0:5:38,76 --> 0:5:40,16
We feel it’s a quality that leads to success, not otherwise.

188
0:5:40,16 --> 0:5:40,44
At the right time,

189
0:5:40,44 --> 0:5:41,56
Do we think it’s foolish?

190
0:5:41,56 --> 0:5:43,32
But this is a Schrödinger’s quality.

191
0:5:43,32 --> 0:5:45,54
We didn't know until things were settled.

192
0:5:45,54 --> 0:5:46,8
So I came out to work.

193
0:5:46,8 --> 0:5:48,9
I don't care about the money.

194
0:5:48,9 --> 0:5:49,65
I'm always thinking about the boss's decisions.

195
0:5:49,65 --> 0:5:50,35
Whether it's smart or not,

196
0:5:50,35 --> 0:5:51,69
it makes me look a bit foolish.

197
0:5:51,69 --> 0:5:52,53
No matter how foolish it is,

198
0:5:52,53 --> 0:5:53,87
things need to move forward.

199
0:5:53,87 --> 0:5:56,85
As long as I get what I deserve,

200
0:5:56,85 --> 0:5:58,23
the core interests remain unchanged.

201
0:5:58,23 --> 0:5:59,58
Other trivial matters

202
0:5:59,58 --> 0:6:2,4
This is my current survival strategy in the workplace

203
0:6:2,4 --> 0:6:2,8
Thank you all

204
0:6:2,8 --> 0:6:5,42
Thank you, Teacher Erdar, for sharing your workplace experience with us.

205
0:6:5,42 --> 0:6:8,2
I feel like I've gained another survival skill

206
0:6:8,2 --> 0:6:10,36
I've even learned how to find a sea view room in Taihu

207
0:6:10,36 --> 0:6:12,8
Next, let's welcome Teacher Yueyue from the opposing side

208
0:6:12,8 --> 0:6:14,18
To start your argument

209
0:6:14,18 --> 0:6:17,22
Let's first clarify a few concepts and definitions

210
0:6:17,22 --> 0:6:19,22
First, who gets to decide what's foolish

211
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:21,54
First, the boss definitely doesn't think they're stupid.

212
0:6:21,54 --> 0:6:22,94
Even if they do think so,

213
0:6:22,94 --> 0:6:23,78
they won't say it out loud.

214
0:6:23,78 --> 0:6:25,42
So, it's up to the employees to judge.

215
0:6:25,42 --> 0:6:27,18
When it comes to macro strategies,

216
0:6:27,18 --> 0:6:28,58
as Professor Zhang mentioned earlier,

217
0:6:28,58 --> 0:6:30,26
most employees are beyond your control,

218
0:6:30,26 --> 0:6:31,18
they don't fall under your jurisdiction,

219
0:6:31,18 --> 0:6:32,23
and you shouldn't even try to manage them.

220
0:6:32,23 --> 0:6:35,13
The only area you have decision-making power over is the daily execution level.

221
0:6:35,13 --> 0:6:36,84
to genuinely impact employees

222
0:6:36,84 --> 0:6:39,9
like getting five days' work done in one day

223
0:6:39,9 --> 0:6:41,36
when there's no need for overtime

224
0:6:41,36 --> 0:6:42,38
forcing you to work overtime

225
0:6:42,38 --> 0:6:44,92
based on groundless assumptions

226
0:6:44,92 --> 0:6:46,16
or off-the-cuff decisions

227
0:6:46,16 --> 0:6:48,32
saying the project must go ahead

228
0:6:48,32 --> 0:6:49,98
ultimately leading to the project's failure

229
0:6:49,98 --> 0:6:51,3
wasting resources and manpower

230
0:6:51,3 --> 0:6:54,8
of course, that doesn't mean all bosses are incompetent

231
0:6:54,8 --> 0:6:56,72
After all, the fact that a boss is in this position can speak volumes.

232
0:6:56,72 --> 0:6:58,32
It also reveals a lot about their capabilities.

233
0:6:58,32 --> 0:7:0,36
A survey by the Post-Wave Research Institute found that

234
0:7:0,36 --> 0:7:4,16
only 15% of employees believe their boss is all-powerful.

235
0:7:4,16 --> 0:7:5,2
So it's clear that

236
0:7:5,2 --> 0:7:8,6
most bosses are actually open to listening to their team.

237
0:7:8,6 --> 0:7:10,389
So don't underestimate your boss.

238
0:7:10,389 --> 0:7:12,809
Don't let some bosses' behavior on social media

239
0:7:12,809 --> 0:7:13,889
skew your perception of them,

240
0:7:13,889 --> 0:7:17,5
just because they're labeled as brainless PUV non-stick pans or something.

241
0:7:17,5 --> 0:7:19,33
What about this super male and so on?

242
0:7:19,33 --> 0:7:21,65
Most bosses also need to hire people.

243
0:7:21,65 --> 0:7:25,809
Most bosses are willing to listen to their employees' genuine voices and feelings.

244
0:7:25,809 --> 0:7:29,96
Therefore, I believe that a boss's foolish decisions should be opposed.

245
0:7:29,96 --> 0:7:31,52
From a personal perspective,

246
0:7:31,52 --> 0:7:32,0
it's crucial.

247
0:7:32,0 --> 0:7:33,36
It concerns you personally.

248
0:7:33,36 --> 0:7:34,96
I exist as a working individual.

249
0:7:34,96 --> 0:7:39,3
Opposing can effectively reduce necessary work pressure.

250
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:42,34
Because once you comply with a foolish decision,

251
0:7:42,34 --> 0:7:45,2
You'll find that in the end, the one who suffers is still yourself.

252
0:7:45,2 --> 0:7:46,39
I have a friend,

253
0:7:46,39 --> 0:7:49,3
who is the head of software development for a certain company,

254
0:7:49,3 --> 0:7:50,37
but I don't do this myself,

255
0:7:50,37 --> 0:7:51,45
he took on a project,

256
0:7:51,45 --> 0:7:52,33
and followed the process,

257
0:7:52,33 --> 0:7:54,5
expecting to complete it within two weeks,

258
0:7:54,5 --> 0:7:54,89
but his boss,

259
0:7:54,89 --> 0:7:57,62
insisted on using a new method that hadn't been tested for innovation,

260
0:7:57,62 --> 0:7:59,66
which extended the two weeks to four.

261
0:7:59,66 --> 0:8:1,96
So he has to work overtime for these extra two weeks

262
0:8:1,96 --> 0:8:3,12
But he's also the supervisor

263
0:8:3,12 --> 0:8:4,44
When he works overtime, he can't go home

264
0:8:4,44 --> 0:8:8,0
As a result, the project wasn't only delivered late

265
0:8:8,0 --> 0:8:8,94
We lost the client

266
0:8:8,94 --> 0:8:11,1
And almost lost his wife too

267
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:12,68
The boss even added, after the fact

268
0:8:12,68 --> 0:8:14,13
Why didn't you remind me back then?

269
0:8:14,13 --> 0:8:15,49
So, in cases like this

270
0:8:15,49 --> 0:8:18,41
Sending these low-level minions to catch the Tang Monk and his disciples

271
0:8:18,41 --> 0:8:22,19
Such situations are really common in the workplace.

272
0:8:22,19 --> 0:8:24,72
For example, what was supposed to be 10,000 yuan,

273
0:8:24,72 --> 0:8:26,6
you're given a budget of 5,000.

274
0:8:26,6 --> 0:8:27,6
Or even asked to organize a Spring Festival Gala with 5,000.

275
0:8:27,6 --> 0:8:29,68
How is that even possible, right?

276
0:8:29,68 --> 0:8:31,0
A task that ten people can complete in a week,

277
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:32,26
you're asked to finish alone in three days.

278
0:8:32,26 --> 0:8:35,6
And then they set your KPIs unrealistically high,

279
0:8:35,6 --> 0:8:37,67
only to say at year-end that you didn't meet them,

280
0:8:37,67 --> 0:8:39,27
resulting in a halved bonus.

281
0:8:39,27 --> 0:8:41,41
It could even affect your salary.

282
0:8:41,41 --> 0:8:42,81
Do you agree or disagree with this?

283
0:8:42,81 --> 0:8:45,1
On the contrary, appropriately voicing your opposition

284
0:8:45,1 --> 0:8:48,2
can not only prevent you from being blamed but also

285
0:8:48,2 --> 0:8:51,8
open up a reverse channel for promotion.

286
0:8:51,8 --> 0:8:53,2
This channel is beneficial for individuals.

287
0:8:53,2 --> 0:8:53,62
Of course,

288
0:8:53,62 --> 0:8:56,699
it’s especially suitable for young people who are eager to advance.

289
0:8:56,699 --> 0:8:57,699
So, after all that’s been said,

290
0:8:57,699 --> 0:8:58,799
are you all aware of this?

291
0:8:58,799 --> 0:9:1,99
It should truly encompass a diversity of voices

292
0:9:1,99 --> 0:9:3,26
to help our organization develop better

293
0:9:3,26 --> 0:9:4,52
through multidimensional thinking

294
0:9:4,52 --> 0:9:7,22
making rational decisions is what we should focus on

295
0:9:7,22 --> 0:9:9,16
As a psychologist

296
0:9:9,16 --> 0:9:9,82
making decisions

297
0:9:9,82 --> 0:9:11,18
especially group decisions

298
0:9:11,18 --> 0:9:13,48
is a research area I am particularly passionate about

299
0:9:13,48 --> 0:9:17,62
excessive conformity can lead to organizational inertia

300
0:9:17,62 --> 0:9:18,76
So, what does organizational inertia mean

301
0:9:18,76 --> 0:9:20,62
It's akin to group polarization

302
0:9:20,62 --> 0:9:22,44
or the spiral of silence scenario

303
0:9:22,44 --> 0:9:23,18
where you don't speak up

304
0:9:23,18 --> 0:9:23,7
and neither does he

305
0:9:23,7 --> 0:9:24,9
or you take on this role

306
0:9:24,9 --> 0:9:25,34
and he does too

307
0:9:25,34 --> 0:9:26,18
he also complies fully

308
0:9:26,18 --> 0:9:28,2
and in the end, this role becomes extremely extreme

309
0:9:28,2 --> 0:9:30,58
if foolish decisions are passed down layer by layer

310
0:9:30,58 --> 0:9:32,74
and no one objects throughout the process

311
0:9:32,74 --> 0:9:34,74
The organization is likely to accelerate its decline.

312
0:9:34,74 --> 0:9:36,82
So, when facing a boss who plays a foolish role,

313
0:9:36,82 --> 0:9:39,9
whether from a personal career perspective or from a business development perspective,

314
0:9:39,9 --> 0:9:41,9
I should believe that everyone should persist in

315
0:9:41,9 --> 0:9:43,76
reasonably voicing their objections.

316
0:9:43,76 --> 0:9:45,28
Thank you all.

317
0:9:46,12 --> 0:9:47,9
Thank you both for your shares.

318
0:9:47,9 --> 0:9:50,82
Next, we'll move on to the question-and-answer session.

319
0:9:50,82 --> 0:9:53,76
Each side will have one and a half minutes to ask questions to the other side,

320
0:9:53,76 --> 0:9:57,21
and one and a half minutes to summarize their own questions.

321
0:9:57,21 --> 0:10:0,53
The respondent's answer is not counted in the questioner's time.

322
0:10:0,53 --> 0:10:3,46
So, let's start by giving the floor to the opposition.

323
0:10:3,46 --> 0:10:6,62
One thing is, I feel that although you are the second-in-command,

324
0:10:6,62 --> 0:10:7,44
you are very modest,

325
0:10:7,44 --> 0:10:10,0
but you are also the boss of the company.

326
0:10:10,0 --> 0:10:10,98
So I'd like to ask you,

327
0:10:10,98 --> 0:10:13,94
have your employees ever raised objections to you?

328
0:10:13,94 --> 0:10:17,86
I'm actually not the kind of boss you might think I am.

329
0:10:17,86 --> 0:10:19,46
If there were a second-in-command in your company,

330
0:10:19,46 --> 0:10:21,94
you should know that it's a role that's often caught between a rock and a hard place.

331
0:10:21,94 --> 0:10:23,44
The boss thinks you're not the boss.

332
0:10:23,44 --> 0:10:25,42
The employees wonder what gives you the right to represent us.

333
0:10:25,42 --> 0:10:27,14
So I'm basically in the middle.

334
0:10:27,14 --> 0:10:28,46
It's really hard for me to navigate this situation.

335
0:10:28,46 --> 0:10:32,14
I haven't really proposed any significant policies that the company wants.

336
0:10:32,14 --> 0:10:32,86
The policies from above,

337
0:10:32,86 --> 0:10:34,24
I just pass them on as a messenger.

338
0:10:34,24 --> 0:10:36,44
To get to the position of second-in-command,

339
0:10:36,44 --> 0:10:37,56
it's not about opposing everything.

340
0:10:37,56 --> 0:10:39,22
It's better to play it safe first.

341
0:10:39,22 --> 0:10:42,25
So, actually, no army has presented a counterexample to you.

342
0:10:42,25 --> 0:10:44,56
Have you heard of these kinds of things on the internet?

343
0:10:44,56 --> 0:10:45,76
For example, if you were the second-in-command.

344
0:10:45,76 --> 0:10:47,28
Do middle managers have similar issues with upper management?

345
0:10:47,28 --> 0:10:49,16
I heard when I presented my argument earlier.

346
0:10:49,16 --> 0:10:50,3
I often say,

347
0:10:50,3 --> 0:10:53,13
I frequently disagree with my boss's opinions.

348
0:10:53,13 --> 0:10:54,35
Now I choose to comply.

349
0:10:54,35 --> 0:10:55,35
It's because I've already realized,

350
0:10:55,35 --> 0:10:56,16
That opposing is futile.

351
0:10:56,16 --> 0:10:57,97
He just wastes my energy a lot.

352
0:10:57,97 --> 0:10:59,77
And as the teacher mentioned earlier

353
0:10:59,77 --> 0:11:2,85
Opposition can effectively reduce unnecessary work stress

354
0:11:2,85 --> 0:11:4,37
I completely disagree with this

355
0:11:4,37 --> 0:11:7,26
I believe compliance will significantly reduce my work pressure.

356
0:11:7,26 --> 0:11:7,94
What are you talking about?

357
0:11:7,94 --> 0:11:8,48
Right, right, right

358
0:11:8,48 --> 0:11:9,92
I'll just go ahead and do it

359
0:11:9,92 --> 0:11:11,58
Because whenever I oppose my boss

360
0:11:11,58 --> 0:11:12,66
He says you're opposing this

361
0:11:12,66 --> 0:11:14,44
I need to tell you why he's great

362
0:11:14,44 --> 0:11:15,34
You don't get it, do you?

363
0:11:15,34 --> 0:11:16,3
You're too young

364
0:11:16,3 --> 0:11:18,52
Let me explain that there's a reason for this

365
0:11:18,52 --> 0:11:19,6
You'll understand in a couple of years

366
0:11:19,6 --> 0:11:20,76
I'll go have a chat with him

367
0:11:20,76 --> 0:11:21,46
What for?

368
0:11:21,46 --> 0:11:21,88
Right?

369
0:11:21,88 --> 0:11:23,0
I just said okay

370
0:11:23,0 --> 0:11:23,78
I went and did it

371
0:11:23,78 --> 0:11:25,8
He waited three days before asking me anything.

372
0:11:25,8 --> 0:11:25,32
The result was

373
0:11:25,32 --> 0:11:25,96
I said it’s in progress.

374
0:11:25,96 --> 0:11:26,49
It’s in progress.

375
0:11:26,49 --> 0:11:28,73
If he waits five days, he might change his mind.

376
0:11:28,73 --> 0:11:29,87
Then I wouldn’t have to do it.

377
0:11:29,87 --> 0:11:31,49
If we turn this into a

378
0:11:31,49 --> 0:11:33,33
budget issue, like we just mentioned,

379
0:11:33,33 --> 0:11:35,32
let’s say you have a budget of 5000,

380
0:11:35,32 --> 0:11:37,1
and you’re asked to do something worth 10,000 or even 100,000.

381
0:11:37,1 --> 0:11:38,96
He has a deadline for this.

382
0:11:38,96 --> 0:11:39,86
There's nothing we can do about it.

383
0:11:39,86 --> 0:11:40,7
You're in the middle management, right?

384
0:11:40,7 --> 0:11:42,14
You might also have to lead a team.

385
0:11:42,14 --> 0:11:43,22
What should we do then?

386
0:11:43,22 --> 0:11:44,6
If it's an objective fact,

387
0:11:44,6 --> 0:11:46,5
I suggest you bring this issue directly to your boss.

388
0:11:46,5 --> 0:11:47,22
You could say,

389
0:11:47,22 --> 0:11:48,22
You've given me a budget of 5000,

390
0:11:48,22 --> 0:11:48,94
But we need to accomplish work worth 10,000.

391
0:11:48,94 --> 0:11:50,6
You tell me what to do.

392
0:11:50,6 --> 0:11:51,16
I'll follow your lead.

393
0:11:51,16 --> 0:11:53,46
But in a way, that's also a form of resistance.

394
0:11:53,46 --> 0:11:55,38
I don't personally see it as resistance.

395
0:11:55,38 --> 0:11:57,62
Because I feel that what you're teaching me to do,

396
0:11:57,62 --> 0:11:59,98
the fact that I'm pushing it forward is a form of compliance.

397
0:11:59,98 --> 0:12:1,86
Resistance would be if I decided not to do it at all.

398
0:12:1,86 --> 0:12:5,12
But it's just outward compliance with inward resistance, isn't it?

399
0:12:5,12 --> 0:12:6,14
No, no, no, no.

400
0:12:6,14 --> 0:12:7,44
That could be a problem, hahaha.

401
0:12:7,44 --> 0:12:9,6
Well, I’d like to ask, as a middle manager

402
0:12:9,6 --> 0:12:9,58
and also a boss,

403
0:12:9,58 --> 0:12:12,28
have you ever made some foolish decisions?

404
0:12:12,28 --> 0:12:13,88
I definitely need to admit it openly.

405
0:12:13,88 --> 0:12:16,48
I think everyone has made foolish decisions at some point.

406
0:12:16,48 --> 0:12:19,16
It’s through these missteps that we

407
0:12:19,16 --> 0:12:20,48
learn and grow as individuals.

408
0:12:20,48 --> 0:12:22,12
I don’t think anyone would stand up and say

409
0:12:22,12 --> 0:12:23,72
I’ve never made a foolish decision in my life

410
0:12:23,72 --> 0:12:25,25
before a decision is implemented.

411
0:12:25,25 --> 0:12:26,69
Am I the divine farmer tasting a hundred herbs?

412
0:12:26,69 --> 0:12:27,63
I won't take a bite.

413
0:12:27,63 --> 0:12:29,78
How would I know if it's poison or medicine?

414
0:12:29,78 --> 0:12:30,58
I've taken it in.

415
0:12:30,58 --> 0:12:32,24
I'm starting to feel a reaction in my body.

416
0:12:32,24 --> 0:12:35,38
There are objective facts and outcomes right in front of me.

417
0:12:35,38 --> 0:12:36,62
Only then can it inform me.

418
0:12:36,62 --> 0:12:39,87
Whether this was a smart or foolish decision.

419
0:12:39,87 --> 0:12:42,33
Before there's an objective outcome for this thing.

420
0:12:42,33 --> 0:12:45,39
I don't think anyone could predict it in advance.

421
0:12:45,39 --> 0:12:47,94
This is about being foolish or not.

422
0:12:48,7 --> 0:12:52,4
Let's wrap up this segment of soul-searching questions for now.

423
0:12:52,4 --> 0:12:54,14
Next, let's take a moment to summarize the questions we've asked.

424
0:12:54,14 --> 0:12:56,2
Let's listen to his thoughts.

425
0:12:56,2 --> 0:12:58,9
I think the opposition doesn't have to be confrontational.

426
0:12:58,9 --> 0:13:0,98
You can offer some gentle counterpoints.

427
0:13:0,98 --> 0:13:2,82
The boss can actually be quite open to them.

428
0:13:2,82 --> 0:13:4,58
I have data to back this up, after all.

429
0:13:4,58 --> 0:13:6,58
But what if you encounter a situation where

430
0:13:6,58 --> 0:13:8,74
You feel the project has obvious issues.

431
0:13:8,74 --> 0:13:9,78
But your boss asks you to recommend

432
0:13:9,78 --> 0:13:10,9
You can say to your boss,

433
0:13:10,9 --> 0:13:13,26
I think your idea is really great.

434
0:13:13,26 --> 0:13:14,62
First, you need to acknowledge your boss.

435
0:13:14,62 --> 0:13:17,52
And it has already been validated by other companies in the market.

436
0:13:17,52 --> 0:13:19,3
This indirectly tells you that it’s not innovative.

437
0:13:19,3 --> 0:13:20,82
Then you need to wait for the right moment.

438
0:13:20,82 --> 0:13:22,74
Wait until your boss says, 'Well, what do you think?',

439
0:13:22,74 --> 0:13:24,34
Come on, tell me how we should proceed.

440
0:13:24,34 --> 0:13:27,1
So at this point, smoothly present your solution.

441
0:13:27,1 --> 0:13:28,45
Or your plan

442
0:13:28,45 --> 0:13:30,93
The key isn't to confront your boss in public

443
0:13:30,93 --> 0:13:32,75
The real satisfaction of dissing your boss

444
0:13:32,75 --> 0:13:35,61
It's about privately and calmly

445
0:13:35,61 --> 0:13:38,45
Expressing such disagreement in a gentle manner

446
0:13:38,45 --> 0:13:39,51
This is crucial

447
0:13:39,51 --> 0:13:41,1
For us as individuals

448
0:13:41,1 --> 0:13:44,1
Indeed, voicing disagreement can help reduce work pressure

449
0:13:44,1 --> 0:13:46,2
It's not about blindly conforming

450
0:13:46,2 --> 0:13:47,76
Excessive stress can harm your physical and mental health

451
0:13:47,76 --> 0:13:48,42
As I mentioned earlier

452
0:13:48,42 --> 0:13:49,78
it can really cause significant problems

453
0:13:49,78 --> 0:13:51,69
let me explain why

454
0:13:51,69 --> 0:13:52,189
I don’t need to do statistics

455
0:13:52,189 --> 0:13:53,109
I work as a psychological counselor

456
0:13:53,109 --> 0:13:54,929
the cases of psychological counseling I receive each year

457
0:13:54,929 --> 0:13:55,789
in companies

458
0:13:55,789 --> 0:13:58,929
workplace stress issues account for nearly half

459
0:13:58,929 --> 0:14:3,12
so I think people work to earn a living and support their families

460
0:14:3,12 --> 0:14:4,1
but they end up bringing health issues home

461
0:14:4,1 --> 0:14:5,98
This actually ends up being counterproductive for everyone.

462
0:14:5,98 --> 0:14:6,5
What's the point?

463
0:14:6,5 --> 0:14:8,98
Lastly, I want to emphasize a scientifically sound and reasonable opposition.

464
0:14:8,98 --> 0:14:9,86
Not only is there no risk,

465
0:14:9,86 --> 0:14:11,4
but it can even lead to a promotion.

466
0:14:11,4 --> 0:14:12,24
Earlier, I mentioned that

467
0:14:12,24 --> 0:14:15,8
if you genuinely help the boss from the perspective of the company's growth,

468
0:14:15,8 --> 0:14:16,48
go ahead,

469
0:14:16,48 --> 0:14:17,24
think about it for him,

470
0:14:17,24 --> 0:14:18,72
the boss will actually value you more.

471
0:14:18,72 --> 0:14:19,84
Of course, many employees have told me

472
0:14:19,84 --> 0:14:21,2
I just want to earn my own salary

473
0:14:21,2 --> 0:14:22,56
I don’t really have any grand ambitions

474
0:14:22,56 --> 0:14:23,4
It doesn’t matter

475
0:14:23,4 --> 0:14:24,84
After all, it’s just this way

476
0:14:24,84 --> 0:14:28,36
We say that opposing promotion is a minority benefit

477
0:14:28,36 --> 0:14:29,6
I’ll stop here

478
0:14:29,6 --> 0:14:31,94
Thank you very much, Teacher Yue, for sharing the workplace tips with us.

479
0:14:31,94 --> 0:14:34,94
But I’d like to add a friendly note

480
0:14:34,94 --> 0:14:38,76
When we say to the boss, 'This idea of yours is really great'

481
0:14:38,76 --> 0:14:39,88
Pay attention to your tone

482
0:14:39,88 --> 0:14:42,18
Otherwise, it can easily come off as sarcastic

483
0:14:42,18 --> 0:14:46,24
So, let's move on to the crucial questions from the affirmative side

484
0:14:46,24 --> 0:14:49,58
Those who have worked should be able to tell the difference

485
0:14:49,58 --> 0:14:52,24
Is it a rare occurrence for a boss to be incompetent

486
0:14:52,24 --> 0:14:53,95
Or is it a frequent one

487
0:14:53,95 --> 0:14:56,21
When he comes up with over 40 ideas in a day

488
0:14:56,21 --> 0:14:58,69
Do I have to sift through each one to figure out if he's being unreasonable

489
0:14:58,69 --> 0:14:59,99
And which ones I should comply with

490
0:14:59,99 --> 0:15:0,99
And which ones I should oppose

491
0:15:0,99 --> 0:15:2,84
If I switch to a different class

492
0:15:2,84 --> 0:15:5,45
can I guarantee that I'll get a boss who isn't stupid?

493
0:15:5,45 --> 0:15:6,93
If your boss is intuitive

494
0:15:6,93 --> 0:15:8,77
and a normal person, of course

495
0:15:8,77 --> 0:15:10,89
out of 40, generally speaking, relying on this intuition

496
0:15:10,89 --> 0:15:13,62
at least 80% should be fine

497
0:15:13,62 --> 0:15:14,88
it’s feasible

498
0:15:14,88 --> 0:15:16,2
but if you have 40

499
0:15:16,2 --> 0:15:17,18
after the first round of screening

500
0:15:17,18 --> 0:15:18,63
you'll find only four are left

501
0:15:18,63 --> 0:15:21,83
Then it proves that your boss might have issues with his initial business acumen.

502
0:15:21,83 --> 0:15:22,55
There might be a problem from the start.

503
0:15:22,55 --> 0:15:24,59
At this point, you shouldn't be thinking about compliance.

504
0:15:24,59 --> 0:15:26,58
You should be thinking about how to back out.

505
0:15:26,58 --> 0:15:30,1
I don't think that making significant business judgments is a sign of foolishness.

506
0:15:30,1 --> 0:15:32,77
I believe the essence of foolishness is the lack of judgment.

507
0:15:32,77 --> 0:15:34,53
Once he can make business judgments,

508
0:15:34,53 --> 0:15:35,79
it means he has his own considerations.

509
0:15:35,79 --> 0:15:37,57
At this moment, what he considers foolishness,

510
0:15:37,57 --> 0:15:39,319
is clashing with what I consider foolishness.

511
0:15:39,319 --> 0:15:42,219
Why should I assume that mine is definitely right?

512
0:15:42,219 --> 0:15:44,37
I think there's actually an information gap.

513
0:15:44,37 --> 0:15:45,69
What the boss knows,

514
0:15:45,69 --> 0:15:48,37
might differ from what we, as employees, know.

515
0:15:48,37 --> 0:15:48,81
I have a friend,

516
0:15:48,81 --> 0:15:50,13
who really does information flow promotion.

517
0:15:50,13 --> 0:15:51,44
He conducts A/B testing.

518
0:15:51,44 --> 0:15:53,8
He says he focuses on information flow advertising.

519
0:15:53,8 --> 0:15:54,92
If an information flow ad fails,

520
0:15:54,92 --> 0:15:56,28
the system will simply block it.

521
0:15:56,28 --> 0:15:58,12
But their boss is a time jump.

522
0:15:58,12 --> 0:15:59,92
If he doesn’t understand the business, that’s a problem.

523
0:15:59,92 --> 0:16:0,72
He doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

524
0:16:0,72 --> 0:16:1,16
He gives you tasks.

525
0:16:1,16 --> 0:16:1,96
He’s the boss.

526
0:16:1,96 --> 0:16:3,24
And he’s guiding the people who do know.

527
0:16:3,24 --> 0:16:5,4
I can’t even stand it myself.

528
0:16:5,4 --> 0:16:6,36
If that were me, I’d be frustrated.

529
0:16:6,36 --> 0:16:7,6
I can barely tolerate it.

530
0:16:7,6 --> 0:16:9,2
It’s about not knowing the field.

531
0:16:9,2 --> 0:16:11,77
You should talk to someone who understands 123

532
0:16:11,77 --> 0:16:12,83
From this perspective

533
0:16:12,83 --> 0:16:16,34
I think if you can make an initial judgment

534
0:16:16,34 --> 0:16:17,82
that this is a foolish character

535
0:16:17,82 --> 0:16:20,22
then it really should be as you just said

536
0:16:20,22 --> 0:16:21,72
Don't wait until the volcano really erupts

537
0:16:21,72 --> 0:16:23,2
You might not be able to run away by then

538
0:16:23,2 --> 0:16:26,62
Considering whether the probability of the volcano erupting is high

539
0:16:26,62 --> 0:16:29,6
or if the probability of it not erupting is higher

540
0:16:29,6 --> 0:16:31,2
mainly based on the probability of the volcano erupting

541
0:16:31,2 --> 0:16:33,78
It's essentially the decision-making at the top level.

542
0:16:33,78 --> 0:16:35,2
If it's someone at the middle level,

543
0:16:35,2 --> 0:16:37,99
I suppose your position should also be at the top level.

544
0:16:37,99 --> 0:16:40,64
No, I'm just a workhorse.

545
0:16:42,16 --> 0:16:44,52
We're talking about the top level here.

546
0:16:44,52 --> 0:16:47,8
Generally speaking, it tends to be more strategic.

547
0:16:47,8 --> 0:16:48,52
If it's at the middle level,

548
0:16:48,52 --> 0:16:51,35
They might have to focus more on execution.

549
0:16:51,35 --> 0:16:54,49
Another aspect is that we, as individuals, often focus on,

550
0:16:54,49 --> 0:16:56,77
Indeed, there is a low-probability event.

551
0:16:56,77 --> 0:16:59,5
But really, you know,

552
0:16:59,5 --> 0:17:1,37
after I finished telling everyone that story,

553
0:17:1,37 --> 0:17:1,77
I realized,

554
0:17:1,77 --> 0:17:3,89
if a low-probability event really happens,

555
0:17:3,89 --> 0:17:5,99
the company might as well be gone.

556
0:17:5,99 --> 0:17:9,6
But if, as you said, the probability is not high,

557
0:17:9,6 --> 0:17:11,6
it doesn't mean I can't object.

558
0:17:11,6 --> 0:17:14,22
I still want to truly express my voice

559
0:17:14,22 --> 0:17:16,869
Because expressing feelings is an emotion.

560
0:17:16,869 --> 0:17:18,309
We don't have to insist on opposition.

561
0:17:18,309 --> 0:17:19,749
Opposition is more like a decision

562
0:17:19,749 --> 0:17:21,149
Who makes the decision

563
0:17:21,149 --> 0:17:22,81
Who makes the foolish decision

564
0:17:22,81 --> 0:17:24,37
It's not your employee, right

565
0:17:24,37 --> 0:17:25,49
You should express your feelings

566
0:17:25,49 --> 0:17:27,77
After you hear about this role

567
0:17:27,77 --> 0:17:29,3
I was initially shocked

568
0:17:29,3 --> 0:17:31,409
Because I never expected my boss to make such a decision

569
0:17:31,409 --> 0:17:33,49
After being shocked

570
0:17:33,49 --> 0:17:35,169
I tried to find ways to help my boss

571
0:17:35,169 --> 0:17:36,88
to take some kind of remedial action

572
0:17:36,88 --> 0:17:37,82
might be better

573
0:17:37,82 --> 0:17:38,88
Based on my experience

574
0:17:38,88 --> 0:17:40,1
I think as an employee

575
0:17:40,1 --> 0:17:41,34
even if you’re a bit more experienced

576
0:17:41,34 --> 0:17:42,4
even if you just started

577
0:17:42,4 --> 0:17:45,28
if you want to appear more experienced to your boss

578
0:17:45,28 --> 0:17:47,52
you should first contain his decision

579
0:17:47,52 --> 0:17:49,92
or you could first address his opposition

580
0:17:49,92 --> 0:17:51,36
or his voice in the foolish role

581
0:17:51,36 --> 0:17:52,6
Hold him back

582
0:17:52,6 --> 0:17:54,34
and defuse his foolishness

583
0:17:54,34 --> 0:17:56,12
give him a little counter-question

584
0:17:56,12 --> 0:18:0,13
It seems like I'm a bit confused.

585
0:18:0,13 --> 0:18:1,49
Could you break it down for me?

586
0:18:1,49 --> 0:18:2,17
Explain it to me again

587
0:18:2,17 --> 0:18:5,25
This is where the role of middle management comes in, bridging the gap

588
0:18:5,25 --> 0:18:6,87
managing up

589
0:18:6,87 --> 0:18:9,87
shock your boss with PUA first

590
0:18:9,87 --> 0:18:11,53
then teach you how to do the job

591
0:18:11,53 --> 0:18:15,179
Finally, tell him your ID, it's really great.

592
0:18:15,179 --> 0:18:17,23
This is the method provided by Teacher Yu Yue.

593
0:18:17,23 --> 0:18:18,71
Learn it and take notes right away.

594
0:18:18,71 --> 0:18:20,49
Let's go straight into the next part.

595
0:18:20,49 --> 0:18:22,53
This crucial summary phase of the debate.

596
0:18:22,53 --> 0:18:24,42
Please let the affirmative side give their summary.

597
0:18:24,42 --> 0:18:26,7
I think opposing it is the way to go.

598
0:18:26,7 --> 0:18:28,18
A good outcome is the only real result.

599
0:18:28,18 --> 0:18:29,18
A bad outcome is just a cost.

600
0:18:29,18 --> 0:18:30,6
I oppose the idea of success.

601
0:18:30,6 --> 0:18:31,389
What benefits can I get?

602
0:18:31,389 --> 0:18:32,749
If the opposition fails

603
0:18:32,749 --> 0:18:33,989
What cost will I have to bear?

604
0:18:33,989 --> 0:18:36,109
The reason I've always been compliant

605
0:18:36,109 --> 0:18:36,389
is

606
0:18:36,389 --> 0:18:39,53
I think the most the boss would lose is just one employee

607
0:18:39,53 --> 0:18:41,46
But the cost was losing a job

608
0:18:41,46 --> 0:18:43,82
This can have very different implications when it falls on an individual

609
0:18:43,82 --> 0:18:45,2
If I push it to the extreme

610
0:18:45,2 --> 0:18:45,94
I'm asking Professor Yu here

611
0:18:45,94 --> 0:18:48,58
I think the boss's idea today is just too silly.

612
0:18:48,58 --> 0:18:49,84
I have to oppose him.

613
0:18:49,84 --> 0:18:51,2
Would you dare to support me?

614
0:18:51,2 --> 0:18:54,33
If I risk losing this job,

615
0:18:54,33 --> 0:18:55,17
As a friend,

616
0:18:55,17 --> 0:18:56,49
I wouldn’t dare to support him either.

617
0:18:56,49 --> 0:18:57,65
I think you should just play it safe for now.

618
0:18:57,65 --> 0:18:58,89
Just go along with it for now.

619
0:18:58,89 --> 0:19:0,31
Then we can figure out a plan later.

620
0:19:0,31 --> 0:19:2,51
A career doesn’t necessarily have to be pursued through opposition.

621
0:19:2,51 --> 0:19:6,659
I often feel that opposition doesn't necessarily lead to ideal promotions.

622
0:19:6,659 --> 0:19:9,539
Opposition often makes your career more difficult.

623
0:19:9,539 --> 0:19:10,839
I don't even need to be unemployed.

624
0:19:10,839 --> 0:19:12,299
He usually gives me a hard time.

625
0:19:12,299 --> 0:19:13,399
That's already tough enough for me.

626
0:19:13,399 --> 0:19:14,78
I don't want to embark on a long and arduous journey.

627
0:19:14,78 --> 0:19:15,98
I have a grain of sand in my shoe.

628
0:19:15,98 --> 0:19:17,2
I can't even get it out.

629
0:19:17,2 --> 0:19:19,74
This is often what I experience in the nooks and crannies of life.

630
0:19:19,74 --> 0:19:20,62
What I can feel.

631
0:19:20,62 --> 0:19:22,98
Don't bring up any grand ideals with me right now.

632
0:19:22,98 --> 0:19:25,54
I can barely get through the petty struggles in front of me.

633
0:19:27,4 --> 0:19:29,22
Ah, I was actually quite moved just now.

634
0:19:29,22 --> 0:19:32,86
Because our side's Erda teacher mentioned that work is really something you can't afford to lose.

635
0:19:32,86 --> 0:19:36,22
This is a thorn in the side for many young people today.

636
0:19:36,22 --> 0:19:37,16
a heavy burden.

637
0:19:37,16 --> 0:19:38,38
Given this context,

638
0:19:38,38 --> 0:19:40,4
how can the debate proceed?

639
0:19:40,4 --> 0:19:44,8
Next, we'll move into the exciting and intense high-energy clash segment.

640
0:19:44,8 --> 0:19:45,72
The two sides will take turns to speak.

641
0:19:45,72 --> 0:19:47,2
Each side has three minutes.

642
0:19:47,2 --> 0:19:49,62
We'll first invite the affirmative side to speak.

643
0:19:49,62 --> 0:19:50,68
In the past few years of work,

644
0:19:50,68 --> 0:19:54,41
my biggest takeaway is finally understanding the Chinese literature textbook,

645
0:19:54,41 --> 0:19:56,11
what it means by 'people suffer in prosperity',

646
0:19:56,11 --> 0:19:57,15
and 'people suffer in decline'.

647
0:19:57,15 --> 0:19:58,79
When I complain about foolish decisions

648
0:19:58,79 --> 0:19:59,83
When they can catch me off guard

649
0:19:59,83 --> 0:20:1,69
it seems that smart decisions also trip me up,

650
0:20:1,69 --> 0:20:3,81
I end up with nothing to gain either way.

651
0:20:3,81 --> 0:20:6,36
So, since I'm the one suffering anyway

652
0:20:6,36 --> 0:20:9,14
I don't think there's a need to oppose it

653
0:20:9,14 --> 0:20:11,63
I think the core issue is being taken advantage of

654
0:20:11,63 --> 0:20:13,21
Regardless of the decision

655
0:20:13,21 --> 0:20:14,71
If it's about being taken advantage of

656
0:20:14,71 --> 0:20:16,59
I personally think how to avoid pitfalls

657
0:20:16,59 --> 0:20:18,27
Is a direction we need to continue living

658
0:20:18,27 --> 0:20:20,7
And even live better

659
0:20:20,7 --> 0:20:22,97
So I wonder if Professor Zhang has any advice on avoiding pitfalls

660
0:20:22,97 --> 0:20:26,1
I've always felt that having a choice is a luxury

661
0:20:26,1 --> 0:20:27,9
I don’t choose to oppose

662
0:20:27,9 --> 0:20:29,64
Is it because I don’t want to oppose?

663
0:20:29,64 --> 0:20:31,77
I have a hundred voices of opposition in my heart

664
0:20:31,77 --> 0:20:32,93
But what I show

665
0:20:32,93 --> 0:20:34,37
My ultimate decision is to comply

666
0:20:34,37 --> 0:20:35,55
Is it because I have no choice?

667
0:20:35,55 --> 0:20:37,9
After losing this job

668
0:20:37,9 --> 0:20:39,63
Is there a better option waiting for me?

669
0:20:39,63 --> 0:20:41,22
If there were a better option

670
0:20:41,22 --> 0:20:42,7
I wouldn’t care whether to comply or oppose

671
0:20:42,7 --> 0:20:43,38
I'm getting rid of this

672
0:20:43,38 --> 0:20:44,18
I just went straight there

673
0:20:44,18 --> 0:20:45,66
I think everyone is now compliant

674
0:20:45,66 --> 0:20:48,32
because we often don't have better conditions in front of us

675
0:20:48,32 --> 0:20:49,4
there are no better options

676
0:20:49,4 --> 0:20:51,0
no higher platform to move forward

677
0:20:51,0 --> 0:20:53,6
when you don't have a better hand

678
0:20:53,6 --> 0:20:54,18
people tend to seek benefits and avoid harm

679
0:20:54,18 --> 0:20:56,1
what I can choose now is the best I have

680
0:20:56,1 --> 0:20:58,38
I think Professor Zhang made a very important point earlier

681
0:20:58,38 --> 0:21:2,7
It's about how to avoid risks.

682
0:21:2,7 --> 0:21:5,56
But in my teaching career and my research career

683
0:21:5,56 --> 0:21:6,8
including when I was teaching at the university,

684
0:21:6,8 --> 0:21:8,12
I often share a principle with my students.

685
0:21:8,12 --> 0:21:9,7
Well, it's not exactly a principle,

686
0:21:9,7 --> 0:21:11,3
because it might be a hard-earned lesson,

687
0:21:11,3 --> 0:21:12,82
the issue of trial-and-error costs.

688
0:21:12,82 --> 0:21:15,3
This is why we encourage young people to experiment and make mistakes.

689
0:21:15,3 --> 0:21:17,55
Because, first of all, the cost of making mistakes in university is almost zero.

690
0:21:17,55 --> 0:21:18,79
You can even switch majors.

691
0:21:18,79 --> 0:21:19,99
Then you realize after switching majors,

692
0:21:19,99 --> 0:21:20,67
the job you get,

693
0:21:20,67 --> 0:21:22,72
has nothing to do with your major, right?

694
0:21:22,72 --> 0:21:24,26
So, you need to understand,

695
0:21:24,26 --> 0:21:26,64
this is not a huge cost at all.

696
0:21:26,64 --> 0:21:27,96
Many people are overly concerned about the cost,

697
0:21:27,96 --> 0:21:29,2
but you find out in the workplace,

698
0:21:29,2 --> 0:21:29,96
the cost is even greater.

699
0:21:29,96 --> 0:21:31,36
So, when it comes to young people,

700
0:21:31,36 --> 0:21:33,8
I personally encourage them to try and make mistakes.

701
0:21:33,8 --> 0:21:36,48
Especially in the first few years of transitioning from university to the workplace.

702
0:21:36,48 --> 0:21:39,4
The cost of making mistakes isn't actually that high.

703
0:21:39,4 --> 0:21:41,92
Don't think that you have to stay at your first job forever.

704
0:21:41,92 --> 0:21:43,58
Or that your second job will be your last.

705
0:21:43,58 --> 0:21:45,86
A lot of what you learn is part of your early foundation.

706
0:21:45,86 --> 0:21:47,76
You can rely on this to move forward in your career.

707
0:21:47,76 --> 0:21:49,68
How can you enhance your resume?

708
0:21:49,68 --> 0:21:53,55
I think it's important to express your true thoughts at this point.

709
0:21:53,55 --> 0:21:55,57
Regarding the idea of giving up and becoming numb.

710
0:21:55,57 --> 0:21:57,82
I suggest you work for 10 years and see how you feel.

711
0:21:57,82 --> 0:21:59,32
I don't think it's necessary.

712
0:21:59,32 --> 0:22:2,46
So personally, I think if you're young now, especially the younger generation,

713
0:22:2,46 --> 0:22:4,82
if you want to voice your disagreement at this moment,

714
0:22:4,82 --> 0:22:7,28
it's important to express your concerns reasonably.

715
0:22:7,28 --> 0:22:9,0
even when you're older,

716
0:22:9,0 --> 0:22:9,72
talking to your own children,

717
0:22:9,72 --> 0:22:12,1
or boasting about it to others as a conversation starter,

718
0:22:12,1 --> 0:22:13,34
I think these are all very important.

719
0:22:13,34 --> 0:22:14,66
After all, you were young once too.

720
0:22:14,66 --> 0:22:17,3
Haven't you heard Honglei say that if you're not passionate, you're not young?

721
0:22:17,3 --> 0:22:17,66
Right?

722
0:22:17,66 --> 0:22:19,26
So I think this statement is really important.

723
0:22:19,26 --> 0:22:22,12
I feel like the teacher said a lot of encouraging words to me.

724
0:22:22,12 --> 0:22:23,38
A lot of support for your decision.

725
0:22:23,38 --> 0:22:24,48
Especially how young people should behave.

726
0:22:24,48 --> 0:22:25,719
I'm a young person too.

727
0:22:25,719 --> 0:22:26,999
I graduated in 2020.

728
0:22:26,999 --> 0:22:28,78
It hasn't been that long for me either.

729
0:22:28,78 --> 0:22:30,68
I have so many fears.

730
0:22:30,68 --> 0:22:31,38
I'm afraid of everything.

731
0:22:31,38 --> 0:22:32,5
After this video goes live

732
0:22:32,5 --> 0:22:33,58
The big data recommended to my boss

733
0:22:33,58 --> 0:22:34,26
if I say anything

734
0:22:34,26 --> 0:22:34,74
that's not right

735
0:22:34,74 --> 0:22:35,82
I won't have to go back to work

736
0:22:35,82 --> 0:22:38,47
the teacher's words made me realize

737
0:22:38,48 --> 0:22:41,83
I might have only become like this in recent years

738
0:22:41,83 --> 0:22:44,67
if I had heard the teacher say these things when I was in school

739
0:22:44,67 --> 0:22:46,31
I would have been greatly inspired

740
0:22:46,31 --> 0:22:48,11
I want to be full of drive

741
0:22:48,11 --> 0:22:48,63
With passion

742
0:22:48,63 --> 0:22:50,27
Young people with a spark in their eyes

743
0:22:50,27 --> 0:22:51,79
But as I was listening just now

744
0:22:51,79 --> 0:22:52,67
I found myself thinking

745
0:22:52,67 --> 0:22:54,43
Whether the teacher's correct words

746
0:22:54,43 --> 0:22:56,92
Are applicable in any era

747
0:22:56,92 --> 0:22:58,4
It's right to say this this year

748
0:22:58,4 --> 0:23:0,48
But will it still hold true next year

749
0:23:0,48 --> 0:23:2,8
When I heard those words just now

750
0:23:2,8 --> 0:23:6,81
I suddenly had a flashback to the Winter Solstice I spent back home

751
0:23:6,81 --> 0:23:8,87
My uncle from the sixties and seventies

752
0:23:8,87 --> 0:23:10,55
would often tell me things like this

753
0:23:10,55 --> 0:23:12,39
you know, why is it so hard for you guys now

754
0:23:12,39 --> 0:23:13,46
I think it's still okay

755
0:23:13,46 --> 0:23:16,78
why do you all seem to say that your income is less than last year

756
0:23:16,78 --> 0:23:18,18
why are there so many issues

757
0:23:18,18 --> 0:23:21,46
why do I get the feeling that you've benefited from the times

758
0:23:21,46 --> 0:23:22,44
you haven't been caught in the rain

759
0:23:22,44 --> 0:23:24,2
and you're asking others why they have umbrellas

760
0:23:24,2 --> 0:23:27,69
but I feel like the rain here is already pouring heavily

761
0:23:27,69 --> 0:23:29,25
It was as big as the day we stole the electric scooter with Naoki

762
0:23:29,25 --> 0:23:30,25
It's like when Yiping asked her dad for money

763
0:23:30,25 --> 0:23:30,93
It was raining so heavily that day

764
0:23:30,93 --> 0:23:32,28
You ask me why I have an umbrella

765
0:23:32,28 --> 0:23:33,84
And then you tell me to object

766
0:23:33,84 --> 0:23:34,44
To resist

767
0:23:34,44 --> 0:23:35,26
What am I supposed to resist

768
0:23:35,26 --> 0:23:36,9
Am I supposed to resist the rain from falling

769
0:23:36,9 --> 0:23:38,42
I don't think that makes any sense

770
0:23:38,42 --> 0:23:40,38
Given the heavy rain

771
0:23:40,38 --> 0:23:42,3
With no place to hide

772
0:23:42,3 --> 0:23:44,84
Not knowing what to object to

773
0:23:44,84 --> 0:23:48,24
Holding an umbrella myself is the best choice I can make

774
0:23:48,24 --> 0:23:50,34
And there was another point the teacher mentioned earlier

775
0:23:50,34 --> 0:23:52,42
Because I thought about my college days

776
0:23:52,42 --> 0:23:53,9
So it made me think of a saying

777
0:23:53,9 --> 0:23:56,16
That brave people get to enjoy the world first

778
0:23:56,16 --> 0:23:57,54
I don’t think that way anymore

779
0:23:57,54 --> 0:24:0,38
Now I believe brave people first accept the world

780
0:24:0,38 --> 0:24:2,14
After accepting the truth of the world

781
0:24:2,14 --> 0:24:3,74
I'm still striving to live my life.

782
0:24:3,74 --> 0:24:6,2
This is what I currently consider to be bravery.

783
0:24:6,2 --> 0:24:8,2
Teacher Zhang mentioned the rainy day just now.

784
0:24:8,2 --> 0:24:9,1
I was particularly touched by it.

785
0:24:9,1 --> 0:24:12,6
At that moment, the song that came to my mind was Incessant Rain.

786
0:24:12,6 --> 0:24:14,47
The next line goes, 'The atmosphere isn't quite right'.

787
0:24:14,47 --> 0:24:15,99
The atmosphere wasn't quite right.

788
0:24:15,99 --> 0:24:19,52
It's actually talking about the corporate culture that a company provides to its employees.

789
0:24:19,52 --> 0:24:21,94
When a company doesn't allow it,

790
0:24:23,94 --> 0:24:25,82
there's no atmosphere to speak of.

791
0:24:25,82 --> 0:24:27,44
I wasn't happy in there.

792
0:24:27,44 --> 0:24:29,11
If I'm not happy,

793
0:24:29,11 --> 0:24:30,47
then I might just be surviving.

794
0:24:30,47 --> 0:24:32,46
That's why young people say, um,

795
0:24:32,46 --> 0:24:34,0
I quickly learned to be numb.

796
0:24:34,0 --> 0:24:34,94
Learned to lie flat.

797
0:24:34,94 --> 0:24:37,94
But I personally think we really shouldn't in this era.

798
0:24:37,94 --> 0:24:40,73
Even if the times are tough,

799
0:24:40,73 --> 0:24:42,81
Because I strongly agree with this statement.

800
0:24:42,81 --> 0:24:45,459
I never say it's your fault.

801
0:24:45,459 --> 0:24:46,819
At the same age

802
0:24:46,819 --> 0:24:51,14
you guys are way more capable than I was back then

803
0:24:51,14 --> 0:24:52,36
I genuinely feel this way

804
0:24:52,36 --> 0:24:53,96
because every time I see my graduating students

805
0:24:53,96 --> 0:24:55,1
I think, how can they be so strong

806
0:24:55,1 --> 0:24:56,46
they are just incredibly impressive

807
0:24:56,46 --> 0:24:58,66
so I don’t think it’s your fault if you can’t find a job

808
0:24:58,66 --> 0:25:1,449
it’s just that there are fewer opportunities

809
0:25:1,449 --> 0:25:3,349
and your capabilities have become even stronger

810
0:25:3,349 --> 0:25:5,289
this wall is definitely a result of continuous improvement

811
0:25:5,289 --> 0:25:10,7
That's why we have a round of applause for Teacher Yu Yue's wonderful speech.

812
0:25:10,7 --> 0:25:11,96
As the competition progresses further,

813
0:25:11,96 --> 0:25:14,52
we've indeed touched on many topics concerning young people.

814
0:25:14,52 --> 0:25:16,5
Should we choose to accept reality,

815
0:25:16,5 --> 0:25:18,26
become numb or lie down?

816
0:25:18,26 --> 0:25:19,68
Or should we maintain our sharpness,

817
0:25:19,68 --> 0:25:20,79
and our vigor?

818
0:25:20,79 --> 0:25:22,39
Now, let's hand over to the affirmative side,

819
0:25:22,39 --> 0:25:24,89
for Teacher Er Da to summarize the debate.

820
0:25:24,89 --> 0:25:26,55
During the exchange with Teacher Yu,

821
0:25:26,55 --> 0:25:27,59
I came up with a word

822
0:25:27,59 --> 0:25:28,86
it's 'dislike of stupidity'

823
0:25:28,86 --> 0:25:31,5
who is it that we keep admiring all day long?

824
0:25:31,5 --> 0:25:32,76
I just thought about it

825
0:25:32,76 --> 0:25:35,98
I think it's often us, the ones who seem to have read a bit

826
0:25:35,98 --> 0:25:37,3
with decent education

827
0:25:37,3 --> 0:25:38,54
constantly finding this stupid

828
0:25:38,54 --> 0:25:39,46
that stupid

829
0:25:39,46 --> 0:25:41,68
but can't take off this long robe

830
0:25:41,68 --> 0:25:43,92
we seem to do nothing but dislike stupidity

831
0:25:43,92 --> 0:25:45,16
making myself angry

832
0:25:45,16 --> 0:25:47,34
besides torturing myself both mentally and physically

833
0:25:47,34 --> 0:25:48,82
there’s not much else I can do

834
0:25:48,82 --> 0:25:50,49
so my current thought is

835
0:25:50,49 --> 0:25:52,85
this world isn’t just made up of us

836
0:25:52,85 --> 0:25:55,97
foolishness and contempt are often mutual

837
0:25:55,97 --> 0:25:59,14
from something as big as independent directors funding their own films

838
0:25:59,14 --> 0:25:59,98
some people think they’re foolish

839
0:25:59,98 --> 0:26:1,26
to something as small as me not getting married at 29

840
0:26:1,26 --> 0:26:2,46
others also think I’m pretty foolish

841
0:26:2,46 --> 0:26:7,15
So, who exactly has the right to make such a foolish definition?

842
0:26:7,15 --> 0:26:9,33
I think the boss's foolishness or wisdom is irrelevant.

843
0:26:9,33 --> 0:26:11,949
I don't really care about that decision.

844
0:26:11,949 --> 0:26:13,789
What I should focus on is

845
0:26:13,789 --> 0:26:16,369
which of my own decisions are wise,

846
0:26:16,369 --> 0:26:18,4
and which are foolish.

847
0:26:18,4 --> 0:26:20,68
As for him, he's just a part of my job.

848
0:26:20,68 --> 0:26:22,65
I do what's expected of me.

849
0:26:22,65 --> 0:26:24,53
I'm finding my value elsewhere

850
0:26:24,53 --> 0:26:26,33
I think what Mr. Zhang said is very important.

851
0:26:26,33 --> 0:26:28,409
It's about following the new, right?

852
0:26:28,409 --> 0:26:30,349
We need to listen to our inner voice.

853
0:26:30,349 --> 0:26:33,229
It can also be restated as 'follow your heart', right?

854
0:26:33,229 --> 0:26:34,749
It can also be called following, right?

855
0:26:34,749 --> 0:26:36,53
The heart below might waver.

856
0:26:36,53 --> 0:26:39,57
But I don't encourage everyone to waver when they're young.

857
0:26:39,57 --> 0:26:40,97
Because I'm not that kind of person myself.

858
0:26:40,97 --> 0:26:43,76
But I wouldn't immediately jump to conclusions.

859
0:26:43,76 --> 0:26:45,38
I would find support.

860
0:26:45,38 --> 0:26:47,36
Find people who share my thoughts.

861
0:26:47,36 --> 0:26:50,22
Let's all go online and give suggestions.

862
0:26:50,22 --> 0:26:53,22
I think these are all practical and solid tips.

863
0:26:53,22 --> 0:26:56,67
These are some directional techniques that everyone can use.

864
0:26:56,67 --> 0:26:58,95
Another point I feel is important for young people is:

865
0:26:58,95 --> 0:27:1,41
Or, what’s another point about new entrants to the workplace?

866
0:27:1,41 --> 0:27:2,63
They tend to procrastinate.

867
0:27:2,63 --> 0:27:3,31
They often wait around.

868
0:27:3,31 --> 0:27:5,2
They keep waiting, thinking someone else will do it.

869
0:27:5,2 --> 0:27:7,54
But you'll find that this is referred to as in our social psychology as

870
0:27:7,54 --> 0:27:8,18
diffusion of responsibility.

871
0:27:8,18 --> 0:27:9,58
It's like a tug-of-war

872
0:27:9,58 --> 0:27:10,79
You always think he's putting in effort

873
0:27:10,79 --> 0:27:11,67
He thinks you're putting in effort

874
0:27:11,67 --> 0:27:12,55
In the end, you both lose

875
0:27:12,55 --> 0:27:14,61
But in reality, no one is really trying

876
0:27:14,61 --> 0:27:17,7
In the end, you'll find the boss saying, 'Why didn't you raise any concerns?'

877
0:27:17,7 --> 0:27:18,25
He says, 'I thought you would bring it up'

878
0:27:18,25 --> 0:27:19,5
I thought you would bring it up

879
0:27:19,5 --> 0:27:20,5
It's a tough situation

880
0:27:20,5 --> 0:27:20,79
That's the feeling

881
0:27:20,79 --> 0:27:22,25
It's just that no one ever brings it up.

882
0:27:22,25 --> 0:27:25,42
So, we often say that when people have ideas,

883
0:27:25,42 --> 0:27:26,66
they should at least express them.

884
0:27:26,66 --> 0:27:28,24
I've never said I'm against the idea.

885
0:27:28,24 --> 0:27:30,6
Actually, this debate topic is a bit off track.

886
0:27:30,6 --> 0:27:34,309
I prefer to turn opposition into ideas or feelings.

887
0:27:34,309 --> 0:27:36,369
I think this is something everyone should bear in mind.

888
0:27:36,369 --> 0:27:38,32
You really need to express your feelings.

889
0:27:40,94 --> 0:27:42,42
It's just a matter of different positions.

890
0:27:42,42 --> 0:27:44,22
But you need to stick to your position.

891
0:27:44,22 --> 0:27:44,74
Why is that?

892
0:27:44,74 --> 0:27:46,7
Because only the brain can be foolish.

893
0:27:46,7 --> 0:27:49,8
Just make sure your butt isn’t foolish.

894
0:27:49,8 --> 0:27:49,8
Do you get what I mean?

895
0:27:49,8 --> 0:27:51,92
I mean, stand your ground.

896
0:27:51,92 --> 0:27:53,74
Speak up for your own position.

897
0:27:53,74 --> 0:27:56,16
Don’t just stand there like that.

898
0:27:56,16 --> 0:27:57,2
But your mind isn’t in it.

899
0:27:59,25 --> 0:28:2,88
So your butt can stay smart.

900
0:28:2,88 --> 0:28:4,64
I’m really enjoying sitting on this stage.

901
0:28:4,64 --> 0:28:7,6
I'm the audience member closest to both debaters

902
0:28:7,6 --> 0:28:10,77
We are about to enter the final free summary phase

903
0:28:10,77 --> 0:28:13,69
Let’s have a summary of the entire debate competition

904
0:28:13,69 --> 0:28:16,4
Each side has 4 minutes to speak

905
0:28:16,4 --> 0:28:19,96
Next, we invite Teacher Yu Yue from the opposition to give a summary

906
0:28:19,96 --> 0:28:22,8
Actually, we feel that we have been too good at conforming since childhood

907
0:28:22,8 --> 0:28:24,6
Because conformity itself is

908
0:28:24,6 --> 0:28:27,48
the influence of collectivism in our culture

909
0:28:27,48 --> 0:28:31,1
And the generational transmission within our families

910
0:28:31,1 --> 0:28:34,43
However, I believe that behind conformity, there’s definitely an aspect of psychology

911
0:28:34,43 --> 0:28:37,8
We all know that it's underpinned by the pressure of a collective.

912
0:28:37,8 --> 0:28:38,28
But as social beings,

913
0:28:38,28 --> 0:28:41,32
we are actually deeply afraid of being isolated.

914
0:28:41,32 --> 0:28:42,34
Even if we take a huge step back,

915
0:28:42,34 --> 0:28:43,44
you’re not afraid of being isolated,

916
0:28:43,44 --> 0:28:45,2
many people’s inner voice says,

917
0:28:45,2 --> 0:28:47,16
I don’t really care about the company’s true direction anyway,

918
0:28:47,16 --> 0:28:49,159
I just need to get my paycheck,

919
0:28:49,159 --> 0:28:51,79
it doesn’t affect my regular salary,

920
0:28:51,79 --> 0:28:52,359
I don’t want to be the one sticking my neck out.

921
0:28:52,359 --> 0:28:53,959
I think this can all be understood.

922
0:28:53,959 --> 0:28:54,879
But if this goes on for too long,

923
0:28:54,879 --> 0:28:57,4
you might end up convincing yourself

924
0:28:57,4 --> 0:28:58,94
that you actually like it this way.

925
0:28:58,94 --> 0:29:0,6
It's as if you've achieved self-consistency.

926
0:29:0,6 --> 0:29:3,72
This self-consistency is actually to avoid cognitive dissonance.

927
0:29:3,72 --> 0:29:5,32
In essence, it's a form of self-PUA.

928
0:29:5,32 --> 0:29:8,48
Personally, I believe that when considering all the practical factors,

929
0:29:8,48 --> 0:29:10,44
I'm here to wrap up the debate for everyone.

930
0:29:10,44 --> 0:29:13,16
proposed some methodologies

931
0:29:13,16 --> 0:29:14,7
Let's interpret the first point we mentioned earlier.

932
0:29:14,7 --> 0:29:15,72
When you encounter a project that doesn't work out.

933
0:29:15,72 --> 0:29:17,38
First, learn how to communicate with your boss.

934
0:29:17,38 --> 0:29:19,22
When you review the recording later.

935
0:29:19,22 --> 0:29:20,36
You can take notes for yourself.

936
0:29:20,36 --> 0:29:22,5
If you have any issues, don't voice them on the spot.

937
0:29:22,5 --> 0:29:23,54
Don't criticize in front of everyone.

938
0:29:23,54 --> 0:29:25,6
Handle it more peacefully in private.

939
0:29:25,6 --> 0:29:27,7
Another important point is to avoid relying on past experience blindly.

940
0:29:27,7 --> 0:29:29,18
Don't say to your boss, 'I used to do this.'

941
0:29:29,18 --> 0:29:30,239
I have a lot of experience.

942
0:29:30,239 --> 0:29:31,599
You can put your methods here.

943
0:29:31,599 --> 0:29:32,719
The boss really doesn't like to hear that.

944
0:29:32,719 --> 0:29:34,159
Especially don't compare me to your previous boss.

945
0:29:35,159 --> 0:29:37,17
And I won't even mention what comes after that.

946
0:29:37,17 --> 0:29:39,73
These are the conventional sentence patterns we use.

947
0:29:39,73 --> 0:29:41,55
We shouldn't overuse them too much.

948
0:29:41,55 --> 0:29:43,61
And always be logical and evidence-based.

949
0:29:43,61 --> 0:29:44,57
From the boss's perspective.

950
0:29:44,57 --> 0:29:45,97
Consider things from the company's perspective.

951
0:29:45,97 --> 0:29:49,5
Also, I believe in leading by example.

952
0:29:49,5 --> 0:29:49,57
This saying.

953
0:29:49,57 --> 0:29:53,659
I recommend starting with small things to show your capabilities.

954
0:29:53,659 --> 0:29:54,499
Little details.

955
0:29:54,499 --> 0:29:56,59
First, prove yourself to your boss.

956
0:29:56,59 --> 0:29:58,13
Show your boss that you have actually accomplished something.

957
0:29:58,13 --> 0:29:59,27
That you've at least achieved something.

958
0:29:59,27 --> 0:30:0,52
Even a small success.

959
0:30:0,52 --> 0:30:2,5
Rather than just voicing objections.

960
0:30:2,5 --> 0:30:3,5
Just being negative all the time.

961
0:30:3,5 --> 0:30:4,98
I think this is not advisable.

962
0:30:4,98 --> 0:30:7,38
Instead, we should not oppose just for the sake of opposing.

963
0:30:7,38 --> 0:30:9,74
We should reduce the likelihood of harm to our mental and physical well-being caused by foolish actions.

964
0:30:9,74 --> 0:30:12,88
Because, after all, life is tough.

965
0:30:12,88 --> 0:30:14,72
I have dealt with a lot of cases.

966
0:30:14,72 --> 0:30:16,4
They are truly due to immense life pressures.

967
0:30:16,4 --> 0:30:18,5
There are mortgage payments to be made.

968
0:30:18,5 --> 0:30:19,7
Car loans, and so on.

969
0:30:19,7 --> 0:30:20,9
And there are children to raise.

970
0:30:20,93 --> 0:30:23,3
Then he found that he had to do this job.

971
0:30:23,3 --> 0:30:24,15
But he complied.

972
0:30:24,15 --> 0:30:25,87
But my body really can't take it anymore.

973
0:30:25,87 --> 0:30:27,5
There will come a day when I can't keep up.

974
0:30:27,5 --> 0:30:28,8
What should we do?

975
0:30:28,8 --> 0:30:29,28
Because I've done a lot of research.

976
0:30:29,28 --> 0:30:30,2
Psychological research.

977
0:30:30,2 --> 0:30:30,9
Research on family relationships.

978
0:30:30,9 --> 0:30:31,7
Mainly focusing on intimate relationships.

979
0:30:31,7 --> 0:30:32,38
And workplace relationships.

980
0:30:32,38 --> 0:30:33,28
I also handle interpersonal relationships

981
0:30:33,28 --> 0:30:35,1
The essence of interpersonal relationships lies in

982
0:30:35,1 --> 0:30:35,87
communication

983
0:30:35,87 --> 0:30:37,49
When you find communication isn't going well

984
0:30:37,49 --> 0:30:39,5
you might be less inclined to communicate

985
0:30:39,5 --> 0:30:41,9
This could be because you feel the person doesn't respond

986
0:30:41,9 --> 0:30:42,21
They keep sending me messages

987
0:30:42,21 --> 0:30:43,29
Like, they send ten messages at a time

988
0:30:43,29 --> 0:30:43,91
You don't reply

989
0:30:43,91 --> 0:30:44,69
Or you reply with just one

990
0:30:44,69 --> 0:30:46,29
Go take a shower or something like that.

991
0:30:46,29 --> 0:30:48,57
These things don’t have any substantial content.

992
0:30:48,57 --> 0:30:49,83
So people don’t want to communicate.

993
0:30:49,83 --> 0:30:51,21
But I genuinely recommend that everyone

994
0:30:51,21 --> 0:30:52,46
Especially in companies,

995
0:30:52,46 --> 0:30:55,22
It’s still important to set up something like this within your own company,

996
0:30:55,22 --> 0:30:57,48
Of course, I know you all have your own small groups already,

997
0:30:57,48 --> 0:30:59,84
There will definitely be internal communication groups,

998
0:30:59,84 --> 0:31:3,32
Even if these groups can’t really influence the final decisions,

999
0:31:3,32 --> 0:31:5,0
At least they can help us communicate internally.

1000
0:31:5,0 --> 0:31:7,46
There's a release and relief of emotions

1001
0:31:7,46 --> 0:31:10,2
I think this is also very important for the present

1002
0:31:10,2 --> 0:31:11,5
And it's practical

1003
0:31:11,5 --> 0:31:13,25
Personally, I feel that

1004
0:31:13,25 --> 0:31:16,41
We shouldn't let a culture of power become the core of the company

1005
0:31:16,41 --> 0:31:17,57
Or the core of the business

1006
0:31:17,57 --> 0:31:22,28
Because power, at its essence, is a significant concession

1007
0:31:22,28 --> 0:31:22,7
A compromise

1008
0:31:22,7 --> 0:31:23,76
Such as compliance and so on

1009
0:31:23,76 --> 0:31:26,24
But you need to understand that corporate culture, as mentioned earlier, is crucial

1010
0:31:26,24 --> 0:31:27,38
Stealing electric scooters in the heavy rain

1011
0:31:27,38 --> 0:31:30,5
This kind of tense atmosphere under his protection

1012
0:31:30,5 --> 0:31:32,56
Actually, over time

1013
0:31:32,56 --> 0:31:34,4
It seems like there’s no immediate impact on you

1014
0:31:34,4 --> 0:31:35,8
You’re not in pain

1015
0:31:35,8 --> 0:31:36,4
But when the real pain hits

1016
0:31:36,4 --> 0:31:37,86
You realize it’s in the late stage

1017
0:31:37,86 --> 0:31:39,82
It’s that feeling when you realize the problem is huge

1018
0:31:39,82 --> 0:31:41,48
And you find out that the real late stage isn’t painful at all

1019
0:31:41,48 --> 0:31:42,84
So from this perspective

1020
0:31:42,84 --> 0:31:45,4
We shouldn’t let it become a stable practice.

1021
0:31:45,4 --> 0:31:46,12
Or one that is encouraged,

1022
0:31:46,12 --> 0:31:47,76
the advocated culture and ideology

1023
0:31:47,76 --> 0:31:50,68
This inevitably leads to social rigidity and decay.

1024
0:31:50,68 --> 0:31:52,68
I think the core issue is about

1025
0:31:52,68 --> 0:31:55,36
the loss caused by foolish work practices,

1026
0:31:55,36 --> 0:31:56,8
resulting in more workload,

1027
0:31:56,8 --> 0:31:58,36
affecting future performance evaluations.

1028
0:31:58,36 --> 0:31:59,72
Bearing with it can be understood,

1029
0:31:59,72 --> 0:32:0,92
but being forced to drink is another story.

1030
0:32:0,92 --> 0:32:2,8
Being forced to tell dirty jokes

1031
0:32:2,8 --> 0:32:5,5
These and other forms of harassment

1032
0:32:5,5 --> 0:32:7,5
Even some legal issues

1033
0:32:7,5 --> 0:32:10,3
For instance, some pharmaceutical companies to commit insurance fraud

1034
0:32:10,3 --> 0:32:10,99
From top to bottom

1035
0:32:10,99 --> 0:32:12,47
Actually, you know the right thing to do

1036
0:32:12,47 --> 0:32:13,7
A foolish character

1037
0:32:13,7 --> 0:32:13,95
This is not just foolish

1038
0:32:13,95 --> 0:32:14,97
It’s downright fatal

1039
0:32:14,97 --> 0:32:15,99
You end up complying

1040
0:32:15,99 --> 0:32:17,7
I think it should be fine

1041
0:32:17,7 --> 0:32:17,98
The boss is holding things down for now

1042
0:32:17,98 --> 0:32:20,34
But in the end, you realize everyone is actually reporting together

1043
0:32:20,34 --> 0:32:21,84
Finally, let's talk about this word

1044
0:32:21,84 --> 0:32:23,38
This word is used very cleverly

1045
0:32:23,38 --> 0:32:24,9
As you can see, gentle like a lamb

1046
0:32:24,9 --> 0:32:27,37
But it can also be an ox or a horse, right?

1047
0:32:27,37 --> 0:32:31,19
So we say that today the boss's foolish role can be submissive

1048
0:32:31,19 --> 0:32:32,23
But it can also be opposed

1049
0:32:32,23 --> 0:32:34,52
But what it absolutely cannot be is

1050
0:32:34,52 --> 0:32:37,0
When it is pointed out as foolish

1051
0:32:37,0 --> 0:32:40,33
compliance should still be promoted as the right choice

1052
0:32:40,33 --> 0:32:42,77
So employees should comply with their bosses

1053
0:32:42,77 --> 0:32:45,63
Lower-power individuals should comply with higher-power individuals, these social norms

1054
0:32:45,63 --> 0:32:48,73
I genuinely believe that what should be is not what is

1055
0:32:49,89 --> 0:32:50,99
Absolutely brilliant

1056
0:32:50,99 --> 0:32:55,61
Finally, we invite the affirmative side, Teacher Erdal, to give a casual summary

1057
0:32:55,61 --> 0:32:58,99
I think when I chose the position of the affirmative side

1058
0:32:58,99 --> 0:33:0,35
Actually, he doesn't share my stance.

1059
0:33:0,35 --> 0:33:1,49
He is my predicament

1060
0:33:1,49 --> 0:33:3,29
A lot of what I said today

1061
0:33:3,29 --> 0:33:5,159
might sound like I'm trying to get away with something

1062
0:33:5,159 --> 0:33:8,559
I am taking advantage of everyone's work-related frustration

1063
0:33:8,559 --> 0:33:9,639
to get an unfair benefit

1064
0:33:9,639 --> 0:33:11,819
I guess I'm a bit of a

1065
0:33:11,819 --> 0:33:13,339
A bit of cynicism, perhaps.

1066
0:33:13,339 --> 0:33:16,31
as I mentioned earlier

1067
0:33:16,31 --> 0:33:17,95
when you have no cards in your hand

1068
0:33:17,95 --> 0:33:21,89
staying at the table is the best chance to hang on

1069
0:33:21,89 --> 0:33:24,8
we will eventually draw good cards

1070
0:33:24,8 --> 0:33:26,4
Our company offers a monthly leave policy.

1071
0:33:26,4 --> 0:33:28,14
Female employees can take one day off each month.

1072
0:33:28,14 --> 0:33:29,36
We have a male boss.

1073
0:33:29,36 --> 0:33:31,8
There’s no way she proposed this role.

1074
0:33:31,8 --> 0:33:33,81
It couldn’t have been the young Karami either.

1075
0:33:33,81 --> 0:33:37,19
I only suggested it after I became the second-in-command.

1076
0:33:37,19 --> 0:33:38,45
I feel we have always been

1077
0:33:38,45 --> 0:33:41,9
dancing on a very limited stage.

1078
0:33:41,9 --> 0:33:44,19
What we constantly strive for is a very limited form of fairness.

1079
0:33:44,19 --> 0:33:45,56
Moving up the ladder.

1080
0:33:45,56 --> 0:33:48,52
There's a chance for us to write our own version of fairness

1081
0:33:48,52 --> 0:33:50,56
So when I looked at this question

1082
0:33:50,56 --> 0:33:52,69
I didn't think about opposing foolishness

1083
0:33:52,69 --> 0:33:55,11
I thought about our participation in decision-making

1084
0:33:55,11 --> 0:33:57,41
I've never conformed to my boss's decisions

1085
0:33:57,41 --> 0:34:0,55
I conform to the direction my heart desires

1086
0:34:0,55 --> 0:34:1,79
I just move forward straight ahead

1087
0:34:1,79 --> 0:34:3,27
I'll see where I end up

1088
0:34:3,27 --> 0:34:8,47
I might not be able to leave behind any grand thoroughfares

1089
0:34:8,47 --> 0:34:10,19
But the path I've walked

1090
0:34:10,19 --> 0:34:12,739
This way, those who come after me will have an easier path.

1091
0:34:12,739 --> 0:34:15,639
My stance is to adopt a confrontational attitude

1092
0:34:15,639 --> 0:34:17,219
There will always be challenges to confront.

1093
0:34:17,219 --> 0:34:19,0
You'll end up stuck in the same spot.

1094
0:34:19,0 --> 0:34:21,26
When we walk through a thorny path,

1095
0:34:21,26 --> 0:34:23,94
if you try to cut every thorn in front of you,

1096
0:34:23,94 --> 0:34:26,24
you won't be able to move forward.

1097
0:34:27,27 --> 0:34:30,23
I think of a saying: life is short, only 30,000 days.

1098
0:34:30,23 --> 0:34:31,99
Our time,

1099
0:34:31,99 --> 0:34:34,35
our energy is very limited.

1100
0:34:34,35 --> 0:34:38,25
Don't waste your energy fighting against foolishness

1101
0:34:38,25 --> 0:34:40,21
We should fight against injustice

1102
0:34:40,21 --> 0:34:41,77
Fight against discrimination

1103
0:34:41,77 --> 0:34:44,93
Spend your energy on reading books that are more valuable

1104
0:34:44,93 --> 0:34:47,1
Use your energy to learn a skill

1105
0:34:47,1 --> 0:34:49,219
Use your energy to save money for travel

1106
0:34:49,219 --> 0:34:51,799
Seeing a bigger world requires a lot of energy

1107
0:34:51,799 --> 0:34:53,379
When I don't have energy

1108
0:34:53,379 --> 0:34:56,83
I can't even express the most ordinary care to my family and friends

1109
0:34:56,83 --> 0:34:57,45
I can't do it at all

1110
0:34:57,45 --> 0:34:58,91
So, when it comes to dealing with foolishness

1111
0:34:58,91 --> 0:35:0,15
My stance is to ignore it.

1112
0:35:0,15 --> 0:35:2,24
I'm a very humble person

1113
0:35:2,24 --> 0:35:4,4
what I can do is to cultivate my own character

1114
0:35:4,4 --> 0:35:5,88
achieve a little success

1115
0:35:5,88 --> 0:35:7,24
attain a bit of happiness

1116
0:35:7,24 --> 0:35:9,1
every era produces people like me

1117
0:35:9,1 --> 0:35:11,76
but I believe a better world

1118
0:35:11,76 --> 0:35:15,2
does indeed require more people to be like Teacher Yu

1119
0:35:15,2 --> 0:35:17,16
Let me share a small insight with all of you.

1120
0:35:17,16 --> 0:35:19,37
I feel like I used to drift through life.

1121
0:35:19,37 --> 0:35:22,13
Ever since I accidentally drove my car into a field two years ago,

1122
0:35:22,13 --> 0:35:23,31
because everyone made fun of me,

1123
0:35:23,31 --> 0:35:24,75
I decided to get a racing license.

1124
0:35:24,75 --> 0:35:26,5
My coach taught me a few moves.

1125
0:35:26,5 --> 0:35:29,6
During countless anxious nights,

1126
0:35:29,6 --> 0:35:30,7
these few words,

1127
0:35:30,7 --> 0:35:32,86
often pulled me out of the fire.

1128
0:35:32,86 --> 0:35:34,74
The first one is, 'It won't kill you.'

1129
0:35:36,87 --> 0:35:37,73
The second one

1130
0:35:37,73 --> 0:35:39,87
Anything can happen.

1131
0:35:39,87 --> 0:35:41,17
Don't worry about others.

1132
0:35:41,17 --> 0:35:41,43
Focus on

1133
0:35:41,43 --> 0:35:42,45
finding your own opportunities.

1134
0:35:42,45 --> 0:35:46,55
The third point is once you get on the track,

1135
0:35:47,63 --> 0:35:50,87
it's completely different from sitting in a classroom and operating a simulator.

1136
0:35:50,87 --> 0:35:54,7
Especially when you put on this helmet,

1137
0:35:54,7 --> 0:35:56,89
your field of vision will narrow.

1138
0:35:56,89 --> 0:35:58,27
There's no way around it.

1139
0:35:58,27 --> 0:36:0,21
And you need to have him step up after that.

1140
0:36:0,21 --> 0:36:1,63
You can be flexible in your adjustments.

1141
0:36:1,63 --> 0:36:3,23
What should you pay attention to?

1142
0:36:3,23 --> 0:36:4,56
What should you ignore?

1143
0:36:4,56 --> 0:36:6,3
Where your eyes look is your field of view.

1144
0:36:6,3 --> 0:36:8,8
That’s where your vision lies.

1145
0:36:8,8 --> 0:36:9,64
I really liked this quote at the time.

1146
0:36:9,64 --> 0:36:10,76
Because I misunderstood it.

1147
0:36:10,76 --> 0:36:14,1
I was captivated by the idea that where your eyes look,

1148
0:36:14,1 --> 0:36:16,64
that’s where your career is headed.

1149
0:36:19,58 --> 0:36:20,48
Alright.

1150
0:36:20,48 --> 0:36:24,32
So, let's welcome Professor Jiang to share with us online.

1151
0:36:24,32 --> 0:36:26,2
Regarding the entire debate competition,

1152
0:36:26,2 --> 0:36:27,38
feel free to express all your thoughts.

1153
0:36:27,38 --> 0:36:29,16
You can speak your mind freely.

1154
0:36:31,4 --> 0:36:33,2
I thought the previous debate was incredibly impressive.

1155
0:36:33,2 --> 0:36:35,0
The two professors didn’t seem like they were debating for the first time at all.

1156
0:36:35,0 --> 0:36:37,12
They delivered a truly outstanding debate.

1157
0:36:37,12 --> 0:36:38,8
Or rather, a profound discussion.

1158
0:36:38,8 --> 0:36:38,93
There were many highlights.

1159
0:36:38,93 --> 0:36:41,49
So, as I mentioned at the beginning, this debate should have three fronts.

1160
0:36:41,49 --> 0:36:43,29
Looking at this from the employees' perspective

1161
0:36:43,29 --> 0:36:45,1
First, from the organizational management angle

1162
0:36:45,1 --> 0:36:45,68
Second

1163
0:36:45,68 --> 0:36:47,98
And also from the societal or public angle

1164
0:36:47,98 --> 0:36:48,76
This is the third one

1165
0:36:48,76 --> 0:36:51,44
Now, Teacher Zhang from the affirmative side focuses on the first battlefield

1166
0:36:51,44 --> 0:36:52,0
Here

1167
0:36:52,0 --> 0:36:54,44
Teacher Zhang first sheds his identity as the second boss

1168
0:36:54,44 --> 0:36:55,84
Because the boss identity

1169
0:36:55,84 --> 0:36:57,22
isn't very appealing in this topic

1170
0:36:57,22 --> 0:36:58,92
He said the second boss is in a tough spot, caught between two fires.

1171
0:36:58,92 --> 0:37:0,569
In the company, it’s still best to follow the top boss.

1172
0:37:0,569 --> 0:37:3,189
This helps to reduce the tension between him and the employees.

1173
0:37:3,189 --> 0:37:7,84
And he says he stands on your side.

1174
0:37:7,84 --> 0:37:8,96
Ladies and gentlemen, the opposing side,

1175
0:37:8,96 --> 0:37:10,38
Don’t talk without feeling the pain.

1176
0:37:10,38 --> 0:37:13,29
Because the cost of opposing the boss is too high.

1177
0:37:13,29 --> 0:37:16,47
Employees don’t need to overthink things for the company.

1178
0:37:16,47 --> 0:37:17,51
There’s no such thing as right or wrong.

1179
0:37:17,51 --> 0:37:19,19
We workers just do what the boss says.

1180
0:37:19,19 --> 0:37:19,75
You got it.

1181
0:37:19,75 --> 0:37:20,63
Just carry on and get it done.

1182
0:37:20,63 --> 0:37:22,73
This way, at least you won't get fired.

1183
0:37:22,73 --> 0:37:25,13
This is a classic slimming-down strategy in debates.

1184
0:37:25,13 --> 0:37:26,41
I lowered my position

1185
0:37:26,41 --> 0:37:27,53
I'm just an ordinary person.

1186
0:37:27,53 --> 0:37:28,61
Don't push me to be noble.

1187
0:37:28,61 --> 0:37:30,13
I'll act based on my own interests.

1188
0:37:30,13 --> 0:37:33,87
This approach works if the opponent is quite paternalistic.

1189
0:37:33,87 --> 0:37:35,21
Acting all high and mighty, preaching down to others.

1190
0:37:35,21 --> 0:37:36,46
Then I'll show you how to handle things.

1191
0:37:36,46 --> 0:37:38,92
If the other party adopts this attitude, it can be surprisingly effective.

1192
0:37:38,92 --> 0:37:41,74
Because everyone tends to empathize with an individual's situation.

1193
0:37:41,74 --> 0:37:45,92
However, on the one hand, Teacher Yu is quite cunning and sly.

1194
0:37:45,92 --> 0:37:47,34
He is gentle and refined.

1195
0:37:47,34 --> 0:37:49,21
A set of soft and yielding techniques.

1196
0:37:49,21 --> 0:37:50,89
He doesn’t speak from a position of superiority.

1197
0:37:50,89 --> 0:37:52,71
And he isn’t aggressive at all.

1198
0:37:52,71 --> 0:37:54,13
What he says is all very reasonable.

1199
0:37:54,13 --> 0:37:55,33
I fully understand the challenges young people face.

1200
0:37:55,33 --> 0:37:56,25
I speak for you as well.

1201
0:37:56,25 --> 0:37:57,52
I understand your stance.

1202
0:37:57,52 --> 0:38:0,88
This makes Teacher Zhang's slimming strategy feel like hitting a pillow.

1203
0:38:0,88 --> 0:38:2,68
On the other hand, there's an issue with slimming.

1204
0:38:2,68 --> 0:38:4,0
If you keep slimming down,

1205
0:38:4,0 --> 0:38:5,51
you might end up overdoing it.

1206
0:38:5,51 --> 0:38:7,13
It becomes difficult to build value.

1207
0:38:7,13 --> 0:38:8,31
Because I am no one to anyone.

1208
0:38:8,31 --> 0:38:8,83
No one cares.

1209
0:38:8,83 --> 0:38:10,36
I don’t care about the company or society.

1210
0:38:10,36 --> 0:38:12,52
So, you can only concede the second and third fronts to the other side.

1211
0:38:12,52 --> 0:38:13,86
You can only give those to the other side.

1212
0:38:13,86 --> 0:38:14,96
If you lose too much weight,

1213
0:38:14,96 --> 0:38:16,72
We can see a similar situation in this debate.

1214
0:38:16,72 --> 0:38:18,28
From the perspective of Teacher Zhang as an employee,

1215
0:38:18,28 --> 0:38:19,4
From an individual's perspective,

1216
0:38:19,4 --> 0:38:21,24
He constructed this meaning of compliance.

1217
0:38:21,24 --> 0:38:22,98
I think his final point was really great.

1218
0:38:22,98 --> 0:38:24,24
I'd like to expand on what he said.

1219
0:38:24,24 --> 0:38:26,14
Actually, this debate topic

1220
0:38:26,14 --> 0:38:28,44
From a certain perspective, we can draw an analogy to a human life.

1221
0:38:28,44 --> 0:38:31,68
Life, in a sense, can be seen as an unavoidable journey.

1222
0:38:31,68 --> 0:38:33,2
And it’s also hard to resist.

1223
0:38:33,2 --> 0:38:35,82
Often, it’s also an unreasonable trip.

1224
0:38:35,82 --> 0:38:38,3
The relationship between you and your boss might be similar.

1225
0:38:38,3 --> 0:38:39,95
It’s a kind of analogy.

1226
0:38:39,95 --> 0:38:40,99
In such a situation,

1227
0:38:40,99 --> 0:38:42,43
in your life,

1228
0:38:42,43 --> 0:38:43,67
you might endlessly oppose and complain about this fate.

1229
0:38:46,91 --> 0:38:48,39
Or the arrangement of the environment

1230
0:38:48,39 --> 0:38:50,59
Or to some extent accept it

1231
0:38:50,59 --> 0:38:51,91
And then focus on oneself

1232
0:38:51,91 --> 0:38:53,69
Professor Zhang advocates this value

1233
0:38:53,69 --> 0:38:55,45
Which is about broadening your perspective

1234
0:38:55,45 --> 0:38:59,9
I think this is a great value proposition from an individual standpoint

1235
0:38:59,9 --> 0:39:0,18
Value advocacy

1236
0:39:0,18 --> 0:39:2,42
The first battle ended in a draw

1237
0:39:2,42 --> 0:39:4,26
Or I think Professor Zhang had a slight edge

1238
0:39:4,26 --> 0:39:7,74
But the initiative in the next two battles was in Professor Yu's hands

1239
0:39:7,74 --> 0:39:9,54
Earlier, Teacher Yu discussed corporate management

1240
0:39:9,54 --> 0:39:10,1
innovation

1241
0:39:10,1 --> 0:39:12,569
and the questioning spirit that young people should have

1242
0:39:12,569 --> 0:39:13,849
or their initiative

1243
0:39:13,849 --> 0:39:15,749
to construct opposing values on multiple levels

1244
0:39:15,749 --> 0:39:17,729
and his expression was clear and fluent

1245
0:39:17,729 --> 0:39:18,93
which clearly showed he came well-prepared

1246
0:39:18,93 --> 0:39:20,89
and Teacher Yu also managed to do both

1247
0:39:20,89 --> 0:39:21,89
express his own views

1248
0:39:21,89 --> 0:39:23,77
while also sharing some knowledge points from psychology

1249
0:39:23,77 --> 0:39:24,97
No wonder you're a knowledge zone UPloader

1250
0:39:24,97 --> 0:39:26,43
You really gave the audience a sense of gain.

1251
0:39:26,43 --> 0:39:27,61
It was truly impressive.

1252
0:39:27,61 --> 0:39:30,99
However, the affirmative side didn’t delve much into these two areas.

1253
0:39:30,99 --> 0:39:32,18
They played it a bit thin.

1254
0:39:32,18 --> 0:39:36,88
I thought the affirmative side could have expanded on efficiency within this system.

1255
0:39:36,88 --> 0:39:40,19
Or they could have delved into the significance of cooperation.

1256
0:39:40,19 --> 0:39:43,5
But Professor Zhang’s argument was a bit too lean.

1257
0:39:43,5 --> 0:39:45,62
So, it was hard to build on the value afterward.

1258
0:39:45,62 --> 0:39:47,26
I found that a bit disappointing.

1259
0:39:47,26 --> 0:39:50,14
Then, in the previous round, both sides didn’t really delve into some of the finer points of attack and defense.

1260
0:39:50,14 --> 0:39:51,12
The technical aspects of the debate, I mean.

1261
0:39:51,12 --> 0:39:52,4
Actually, no one really expanded on them much.

1262
0:39:52,4 --> 0:39:54,54
For instance, we could break down the topic, right?

1263
0:39:54,54 --> 0:39:56,46
The very detailed concepts and definitions.

1264
0:39:56,46 --> 0:39:59,26
Like, under what specific circumstances

1265
0:39:59,26 --> 0:40:0,62
would this issue even come up?

1266
0:40:0,62 --> 0:40:1,87
Would it even be raised?

1267
0:40:1,87 --> 0:40:2,87
Because in most cases,

1268
0:40:2,87 --> 0:40:3,39
we all know that

1269
0:40:3,39 --> 0:40:5,67
If the boss occasionally makes some minor and silly decisions

1270
0:40:5,67 --> 0:40:6,55
as long as they're not harmful

1271
0:40:6,55 --> 0:40:7,59
most professionals can understand

1272
0:40:7,59 --> 0:40:11,66
rarely would someone say I’m going to oppose everything the boss does

1273
0:40:11,66 --> 0:40:12,94
a role that seems foolish

1274
0:40:12,94 --> 0:40:14,22
or a role that rubs me the wrong way

1275
0:40:14,22 --> 0:40:15,27
people wouldn’t act like that

1276
0:40:15,27 --> 0:40:17,3
So when does this issue come up?

1277
0:40:17,3 --> 0:40:19,79
The affirmative side could argue whether the company culture is too casual

1278
0:40:19,79 --> 0:40:21,76
making it impossible to enforce work arrangements

1279
0:40:21,76 --> 0:40:23,5
The opposing side can also say that it isn't so.

1280
0:40:23,5 --> 0:40:25,8
It's really because the boss is too foolish.

1281
0:40:25,8 --> 0:40:26,26
There are too many foolish characters.

1282
0:40:26,26 --> 0:40:27,7
That's why this issue exists.

1283
0:40:27,7 --> 0:40:30,459
For example, what does compliance mean?

1284
0:40:30,459 --> 0:40:32,679
Does compliance mean endless compromise?

1285
0:40:32,679 --> 0:40:35,74
Does it necessarily mean servile obedience?

1286
0:40:35,74 --> 0:40:39,2
And opposition, does it necessarily mean being a troublemaker?

1287
0:40:39,2 --> 0:40:41,929
Who, after all, defines foolishness?

1288
0:40:41,929 --> 0:40:45,29
Is there really someone with the authority to make such a decision?

1289
0:40:45,29 --> 0:40:46,63
Is it really the definition of foolishness?

1290
0:40:46,63 --> 0:40:49,57
And does a foolish decision mean it's foolish at the moment?

1291
0:40:49,57 --> 0:40:52,5
Or is it foolish only when viewed with hindsight?

1292
0:40:52,5 --> 0:40:55,47
These questions weren't thoroughly debated by either side.

1293
0:40:55,47 --> 0:40:57,81
But I don't think this is a flaw.

1294
0:40:57,81 --> 0:41:0,23
Anyway, I think it was a very engaging debate just now.

1295
0:41:0,23 --> 0:41:1,9
It gave me a lot of inspiration.

1296
0:41:1,9 --> 0:41:2,94
So thank you, Professor Zhang and Professor Yu.

1297
0:41:2,94 --> 0:41:4,4
Thank you, Professor Jiang.

1298
0:41:4,4 --> 0:41:5,46
Thank you very much indeed.

1299
0:41:5,46 --> 0:41:8,18
Your remarks have also brought us a lot of inspiration.

1300
0:41:8,18 --> 0:41:10,189
I think there's a saying that goes:

1301
0:41:10,189 --> 0:41:13,26
Everyone is an expert in their own problems.

1302
0:41:13,26 --> 0:41:17,32
The foolish decisions made by the bosses we encounter can vary greatly in their foolishness.

1303
0:41:17,32 --> 0:41:19,7
They come in all sorts and sizes.

1304
0:41:19,7 --> 0:41:22,82
The challenges we each face are unique in their own way.

1305
0:41:22,82 --> 0:41:25,94
So it's only natural that some people might feel, hey,

1306
0:41:25,94 --> 0:41:27,5
I should just comply.

1307
0:41:27,5 --> 0:41:29,23
Or I should resist.

1308
0:41:29,23 --> 0:41:33,21
This is also why debates can continue to thrive.

1309
0:41:33,21 --> 0:41:35,79
We all have our own stories to tell.

1310
0:41:35,79 --> 0:41:37,93
So I really encourage everyone to share.

1311
0:41:37,93 --> 0:41:41,21
Feel free to write about the foolish bosses you've encountered

1312
0:41:41,21 --> 0:41:44,25
The boss's foolish character is written in the comments section.

1313
0:41:44,25 --> 0:41:45,96
Let's broaden our horizons.

1314
0:41:45,96 --> 0:41:48,46
You can also share this video with your colleagues.

1315
0:41:48,46 --> 0:41:50,48
to improve your working relationships.

1316
0:41:50,48 --> 0:41:53,76
You can even forward this video to your boss.

1317
0:41:53,76 --> 0:41:56,4
to subtly convey some messages.

1318
0:41:56,4 --> 0:41:59,76
Thank you all for your participation.
